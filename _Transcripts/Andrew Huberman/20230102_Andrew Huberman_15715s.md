# Dr. Sam Harris: Using Meditation to Focus, View Consciousness & Expand Your Mind | Huberman Lab 105
**Andrew Huberman:** [January 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wIt_WsJGfw)
*  Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
*  where we discuss science
*  and science-based tools for everyday life.
*  I'm Andrew Huberman,
*  and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
*  at Stanford School of Medicine.
*  Today, my guest is Dr. Sam Harris.
*  Dr. Sam Harris did his undergraduate training
*  in philosophy at Stanford University,
*  and then went on to do his doctorate in neuroscience
*  at the University of California, Los Angeles.
*  He is well-known as an author
*  who has written about everything
*  from meditation to consciousness, free will,
*  and he holds many strong political views
*  that he's voiced on social media
*  and in the content of various books
*  as they relate to philosophy and neuroscience.
*  During today's episode, I mainly talked to Dr. Harris
*  about his views and practices related to meditation,
*  consciousness, and free will.
*  In fact, he made several important points
*  about what a proper meditation practice can accomplish.
*  Prior to this episode,
*  I thought that meditation was about
*  deliberately changing one's conscious experience
*  in order to achieve things such as deeper relaxation,
*  a heightened sense of focus or ability to focus generally,
*  elevated memory, and so on.
*  What Sam taught me, and what you'll soon learn as well,
*  is that while meditation does indeed hold
*  all of those valuable benefits,
*  the main value of a meditation practice,
*  or perhaps the greater value of a meditation practice,
*  is that it doesn't just allow one
*  to change their conscious experience,
*  but it actually can allow a human being
*  to view consciousness itself,
*  that is to understand what the process of consciousness is,
*  and in doing so, to profoundly shift the way
*  that one engages with the world and with oneself
*  in all practices, all environments, and at all times,
*  both in sleep and in waking states.
*  And in that way, making meditation
*  perhaps the most potent and important portal
*  by which one can access novel ways of thinking and being
*  and viewing one's life experience.
*  We also discussed the so-called mind-body problem
*  and issues of duality and free will,
*  concepts from philosophy and neuroscience
*  that fortunately, thanks to valuable experiments
*  and deep thinking on the part of people
*  like Dr. Sam Harris and others,
*  is now leading people to understand
*  really what free will is and isn't,
*  where the locus of free will likely sits in the brain
*  if it indeed resides in the brain at all,
*  and what it means to be a conscious being
*  and how we can modify our conscious states
*  in ways that allow us to be more functional.
*  We also discussed perception,
*  both visual perception, auditory perception,
*  and especially interesting to me,
*  and I think as well, hopefully to you, time perception,
*  which we know is very elastic in the brain.
*  The literal frame rate
*  by which we process our conscious experience
*  can expand and contract dramatically
*  depending on our state of mind
*  and how conscious we are about our state of mind.
*  So we went deep into that topic as well.
*  Today's discussion was indeed an intellectual deep dive
*  into all the topics that I mentioned a few moments ago,
*  but it also included many practical tools.
*  In fact, I pushed Sam to share with us
*  what his specific practices are
*  and how we can all arrive at a clearer
*  and better understanding of a meditation practice
*  that we can each and all apply
*  so that we can derive these incredible benefits,
*  not just the ones related to stress
*  and focus and enhanced memory,
*  but the ones that relate to our consciousness,
*  that is to our deeper sense of self and to others.
*  Several times during today's episode,
*  I mentioned the Waking Up app.
*  The Waking Up app was developed by Sam Harris,
*  but I want to emphasize that my mention of the app
*  is in no way a paid promotional.
*  Rather, the Waking Up app is one that I've used
*  for some period of time now and find very, very useful.
*  I have family members that also use it,
*  other staff members here at the Huberman Lab podcast use it
*  because we find it to be such a powerful tool.
*  Sam has generously offered Huberman Lab podcast listeners
*  a 30-day completely free trial of the Waking Up app.
*  If any of you want to try it,
*  you can simply go to wakingup.com slash Huberman
*  to get that 30-day free trial.
*  During today's discussion,
*  we didn't just talk about meditation,
*  consciousness and free will.
*  We also talked about psychedelics,
*  both their therapeutic applications
*  for the treatment of things like depression and PTSD,
*  but also the use of psychedelics.
*  And we discussed Sam's experiences with psychedelics
*  as they relate to expanding one's consciousness.
*  I also asked Sam about his views and practices
*  related to social media,
*  prompted in no small part by his recent voluntary decision
*  to close down his Twitter account.
*  So we talked about his rationale for doing that,
*  how he feels about doing that.
*  And I think you'll find that to be very interesting as well.
*  Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize
*  that this podcast is separate from my teaching
*  and research roles at Stanford.
*  It is, however, part of my desire and effort
*  to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
*  and science related tools to the general public.
*  In keeping with that theme,
*  I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
*  Our first sponsor is Levels.
*  Levels is a program that lets you see how different foods
*  and behaviors affect your health
*  by giving you real-time feedback
*  using a continuous glucose monitor.
*  One of the most important factors
*  in your immediate and long-term health
*  are your blood sugar levels.
*  And not just your overall blood sugar levels,
*  but your blood sugar levels throughout the day
*  in response to different foods you eat, to fasting,
*  if you're into fasting, to exercise and so forth.
*  I started using Levels some time ago
*  in order to figure out how different foods
*  impact my blood sugar levels.
*  And indeed it does that very well.
*  It allowed me to see how certain foods
*  really spike my blood sugar and others keep it more level.
*  And in particular, how foods that I eat after exercise
*  can help raise my blood glucose just enough,
*  but not so much that then I get a crash
*  two or three hours later,
*  which is what was happening before I started using Levels.
*  I've made certain adjustments to my diet.
*  I can now eat post-exercise
*  and still have plenty of energy throughout the day
*  without any issues.
*  It also has helped me understand
*  how different behaviors impact my blood glucose levels.
*  If you're interested in learning more about Levels
*  and trying a continuous glucose monitor yourself,
*  go to levels.link slash Huberman.
*  Again, that's levels.link spelled L-I-N-K slash Huberman.
*  Today's episode is also brought to us by Whoop.
*  Whoop is a fitness wearable device
*  that tracks your daily activity and sleep,
*  but goes beyond activity and sleep tracking
*  to provide real-time feedback
*  on how to adjust your training and sleep schedules
*  in order to feel and perform better.
*  Six months ago, I started working with Whoop
*  as a member of their scientific advisory council
*  as a way to help Whoop advance their mission
*  of unlocking human performance.
*  And as a Whoop user, I've experienced firsthand
*  the health benefits of their technology.
*  It's clear based on quality research
*  that Whoop can inform you how well you're sleeping,
*  how to change your sleep habits,
*  how to change your activity habits,
*  even how to modify different aspects of your nutrition,
*  exercise, sleep, and lifestyle
*  in order to maximize your mental health,
*  physical health, and performance.
*  So whether or not you're an athlete
*  or you're exercising simply for health,
*  Whoop can really help you understand
*  how your body functions under different conditions
*  and how to really program your schedule,
*  nutrition, and exercise,
*  and many other factors of your life
*  in order to really optimize your health and performance,
*  including your cognition.
*  If you're interested in trying Whoop,
*  you can go to joinwhoop, spelled W-H-O-O-P,
*  dot com slash Huberman.
*  That's joinwhoop.com slash Huberman today
*  and get your first month free.
*  Today's episode is also brought to us by 8 Sleep.
*  8 Sleep makes smart mattress covers
*  with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
*  I've talked many times before on this podcast
*  about the fact that sleep is the fundamental layer
*  of mental health, physical health, and performance.
*  Now, one of the key things for getting a great night's sleep
*  every single night is to optimize the temperature
*  of your sleeping environment.
*  Put simply, in order to fall asleep and stay deeply asleep,
*  your body temperature needs to drop
*  by about one to three degrees.
*  And waking up, on the other hand,
*  involves a heating of your body by about one to three degrees.
*  With 8 Sleep, you can tune the temperature
*  of your mattress cover or mattress to be cooler or hotter,
*  depending on whether or not you tend to run
*  too hot or too cold.
*  And you can even vary it across the night
*  so that you can access the best deep sleep
*  early in the night, the so-called REM sleep,
*  rapid eye movement sleep that's more pronounced
*  in the later half of the night.
*  And in doing so, really get your sleep optimized,
*  not just in terms of duration, but in terms of quality
*  and the overall architecture of your sleep.
*  This has a profound influence on your alertness,
*  focus, mood, and many other important factors
*  throughout the day.
*  If you'd like to try 8 Sleep,
*  you can go to 8sleep.com slash Huberman
*  to save up to $150 off their Pod 3 cover.
*  8 Sleep currently ships to the USA, Canada, United Kingdom,
*  select countries in the EU, and Australia.
*  Again, that's 8sleep.com slash Huberman.
*  The Huberman Lab podcast is proud to announce
*  that we are now partnered with Momentous Supplements
*  because Momentous Supplements are of the very highest
*  quality, they ship internationally,
*  and they have single ingredient formulations.
*  If you'd like to access the supplements discussed
*  on the Huberman Lab podcast,
*  you can go to Live Momentous spelled O-U-S,
*  so livemomentous.com slash Huberman.
*  And now for my discussion with Dr. Sam Harris.
*  Dr. Sam Harris.
*  You're just talking about this.
*  You are indeed a doctor.
*  You're a scientist.
*  I cannot save your life,
*  but I might save your non-existent soul
*  if we talk long enough.
*  Well, neither of us are clinicians,
*  but we are both brain explorers
*  from the different perspectives, some overlapping.
*  And I'm really excited to have this conversation.
*  I've been listening to your voice for many years,
*  learning from you for many years.
*  And I'd be remiss if I didn't say that my father,
*  who's also a scientist, is an enormous fan
*  of your waking up app.
*  Nice.
*  He has spent a lot of time over the last few years.
*  He's in his late seventies.
*  He's almost 80.
*  He's a theoretical physicist,
*  walking to the park near his apartment
*  and spending time meditating with the app
*  or sometimes separate from the app,
*  but using the same sorts of meditations in his head.
*  So he kind of toggles back and forth.
*  And even, I shouldn't say even,
*  but yes, even in his late seventies has reported
*  that it has significantly shifted his awareness of self
*  and his conscious experience of things happening
*  in and around him.
*  And he was somebody who I think already saw himself
*  as a pretty aware person thinking about quantum mechanics
*  and the rest.
*  So a thank you from him indirectly.
*  That's great.
*  A thank you from me now directly.
*  And I really wanna use that as a way to frame up
*  what I think is one of the more interesting questions
*  in not just science and philosophy and psychology,
*  but all of life, which is what is this thing
*  that we call a self?
*  As far as I know, we have not localized the region
*  in the brain that can entirely account
*  for our perception of self.
*  There are areas of course that regulate proprioception,
*  our awareness of where our limbs are in space,
*  maybe even our awareness of where we are in physical space.
*  There are such circuits as we both know.
*  But when we talk about sense of self,
*  I have to remember this kind of neuroscience 101 thing
*  that we always say, when you teach memory,
*  you say, you wake up every morning
*  and you remember who you are.
*  You know who you are.
*  Most people do.
*  Even if they lack memory systems in the brain
*  for whatever reason,
*  pretty much everyone seems to know who they are.
*  What are your thoughts on what that whole thing is about?
*  Do we come into the world feeling that way?
*  I would appreciate answers from the perspective
*  of any field, including neuroscience of course.
*  Well, big question.
*  The problem is we use the term self
*  in so many different ways.
*  There's one sense of that term,
*  which is the target of meditation
*  and it's the target of deconstruction by the practice
*  and by any surrounding philosophy.
*  So you'll hear, and you'll hear it from me,
*  that this self is an illusion
*  and that there's a psychological freedom
*  that can be experienced on the other side
*  of discovering it to be an illusion.
*  And some people don't like that framing.
*  Some people would insist that it's not so much an illusion,
*  but it's a construct and it's not what it seems.
*  But it's not that every use of the term self is illegitimate
*  and there are certain types of selves that are not illusory.
*  I mean, I'm not saying that people are illusions.
*  I'm not saying that you can't talk about yourself
*  as distinct, yourself as a whole person
*  and with psychological continuity with your past experience
*  as being distinct from the person
*  and psychological continuity of some other person.
*  Obviously we have to be able to conserve those data.
*  It's not fundamentally mysterious
*  that you're gonna wake up tomorrow morning
*  still being psychologically continuous
*  with your past and not my past.
*  And if we swapped lives,
*  that would demand some explanation.
*  So the illusoriness of the self
*  doesn't cut against any of those obvious facts.
*  So the sense of self that is illusory,
*  and again, we might wanna talk about self in other modes
*  because there's just a lot of interest there psychologically
*  and ultimately scientifically.
*  The thing that doesn't exist
*  and certainly doesn't exist as it seems
*  and I would wanna argue that it actually
*  is just a proper illusion
*  is the sense that there is a subject interior to experience
*  in addition to experience.
*  So most people feel like
*  they're having an experience of the world
*  and they're having an experience of their bodies
*  in the world and in addition to that,
*  they feel that they are a subject internal to the body
*  and they're very likely in the head.
*  Most people feel like they're behind their face
*  as a kind of locus of awareness and thought and intention
*  and that it's almost like you're a passenger
*  inside your body.
*  Most people don't feel identical to their bodies
*  and they can imagine,
*  this is sort of the origin, the psychological origin,
*  the folk psychological origin of a sense of
*  that there might be a soul
*  that could survive the death of the body.
*  I mean, most people are what my friend Paul Bloom calls
*  common sense dualists.
*  The default expectation seems to be that
*  whatever the relationship between the mind and the body,
*  there's some promise of separability there.
*  And whenever you really push hard on the science side
*  and say, well, none of the mind is really just
*  what the brain is doing,
*  that begins to feel more and more counterintuitive to people
*  and there still seems some residual mystery
*  at death, maybe something is gonna lift off the brain
*  and go elsewhere.
*  So there's this sense of dualism that many people have
*  and obviously that's supported by many religious beliefs.
*  But this feeling, it's a very peculiar starting point.
*  People feel that they don't feel identical
*  to their experience.
*  As a matter of experience,
*  they feel like they're on the edge of experience.
*  Somehow appropriating it from the side,
*  kind of on the edge of the world
*  and the world is out there,
*  your body is in some sense an object in the world,
*  which it's different from the world.
*  The boundary of your skin is still meaningful.
*  You can sort of loosely control your body.
*  I mean, you can control your gross
*  and subtle voluntary motor movements,
*  but you're not controlling everything your body is doing.
*  You're not controlling your heartbeat
*  and your hormonal secretions and all of that.
*  And so there's a lot that's going on
*  that is in the dark for you.
*  And then you give someone an instruction to meditate, say,
*  and you say, okay, well, let's examine all of this
*  from the first person's side.
*  Let's look for this thing you're calling eye.
*  And again, eye is not identical to the body.
*  People feel like their hands are out there
*  and if they're gonna meditate,
*  they're gonna close their eyes, very likely,
*  and now they're gonna pay attention to something.
*  They're gonna pay attention to the breath or to sounds.
*  And it's from the point of view of being a locus
*  of attention that is now aiming attention strategically
*  at an object like the breath,
*  that there's this dualism that is set up.
*  And ultimately, the ultimate promise of meditation,
*  I mean, there are really two levels
*  at which you could be interested in meditation.
*  One is very straightforward and remedial
*  and non-paradoxical and very well-subscribed.
*  And it's the usual set of claims about all the benefits
*  you're gonna get from meditation.
*  So you're gonna lower your stress
*  and you're gonna increase your focus
*  and you're gonna stave off cortical thinning.
*  And there's all kinds of good things
*  that science is saying meditation will give you.
*  And none of that entails really drilling down
*  on this paradoxical claim that the self is an illusion
*  or anything else of that sort.
*  But from my point of view, the real purpose of meditation
*  and its real promise is not in this long list of benefits.
*  I'm not discounting any of those,
*  though the science for many of them is quite provisional.
*  It's in this deeper claim that if you look
*  for this thing you're calling eye,
*  if you look for the sense that there's a thinker
*  in addition to the mirror rising of the next thought, say,
*  you won't find that thing.
*  And what's more, you cannot find it in a way
*  that's conclusive and that matters.
*  And there's a host of benefits that follow
*  from that discovery which are quite a bit deeper
*  and more interesting than engaging meditation
*  on the side of its benefits,
*  de-stressing, increasing focus and all the rest.
*  I have a number of questions related to what you just said.
*  And first of all, I agree that the evidence
*  that meditation can improve focus, reduce stress, et cetera,
*  it's there, it's not an enormous pile of evidence,
*  but it's growing.
*  And I think that, especially for some
*  of the shorter meditations, which I these days view more
*  as perceptual exercises.
*  Talked about this on the podcast before,
*  but for those that haven't heard it before
*  about perception, you can have exteroception,
*  extending to things beyond the confines of your skin,
*  interoception, which also includes the surfaces
*  of the skin, but everything inward.
*  And meditation through eyes closed,
*  typically involving some sort of attentional spotlighting,
*  something we'll get into, to more interoceptive
*  versus exteroceptive events, et cetera, including thoughts.
*  And so I think of, at a basic level,
*  meditation as somewhat of a perceptual exercise.
*  You can tell me where you disagree there,
*  and I would expect and hope that you would.
*  But I would like to just touch on this idea
*  that you brought up, because it's such an interesting one,
*  of this idea that our bodies are containers
*  and that we somehow view ourselves as passengers
*  within those containers.
*  That's certainly been my experience.
*  And the image that I have is of, as you say that,
*  is of myself or of people out there
*  that sit a few centimeters below the surface,
*  or that sit entirely in their head.
*  And of course, the brain and body are connected
*  through the nervous system.
*  I think sometimes a brain is used to replace nervous system,
*  and that can get us into trouble in terms of coming up
*  with real directions and definitions.
*  But the point is that there is something special
*  about the real estate in the head.
*  I think for as much as my laboratory
*  and many other scientists are really interested
*  in brain-body connections through the nervous system
*  and other organ systems that the nervous system binds,
*  that if you cut off all my limbs,
*  I'm going to be different,
*  but I'm fundamentally still Andrew.
*  Whereas if we were to lesion a couple square millimeters
*  out of my parietal cortex, it's an open question
*  as to whether or not I would still seem as much like Andrew
*  to other people and to myself even.
*  And so there's something fundamentally different
*  about the real estate in the cranial vault.
*  You could even remove both of my eyes,
*  I'd still be Andrew.
*  And those are two pieces of my central nervous system
*  that are fundamental to my daily life,
*  but I'd still be me.
*  Whereas, and this doesn't, I think,
*  just apply to memory systems.
*  I mean, I think there are reasons that the frontal cortex
*  that when destroyed have been shown to modify personality
*  and self-perception in dramatic ways.
*  So it's a sort of obvious point once it's made,
*  but I do think it's worth highlighting
*  because there does seem to be something special
*  about being in the head.
*  The other thing is that sitting a few centimeters
*  below the surface or riding in this container
*  makes sense to me, except I wonder if you've ever
*  experienced a shift as I have when something
*  very extreme happens, let's use the negative example of,
*  all of a sudden you're in a fear state.
*  All of a sudden it feels as if your entire body
*  is you or is me.
*  And now I need to get this thing, the whole container,
*  and me to some place of safety in whatever form.
*  This is also true, I think, in ecstatic states
*  where you can feel really, when people say embodied,
*  I wonder whether or not we normally oscillate
*  below the surface of our body.
*  When I say oscillate, I mean in neural terms,
*  I mean maybe our sensory experience is not truly
*  at the bodily surface, but sits below the bodily surface
*  more at the level of organ systems and within our head.
*  And then certain things that jolt us,
*  our autonomic nervous system into heightened states
*  bring us into states of, bring us closer to the surface
*  and therefore include all of us.
*  Again, I don't wanna take us down a mechanistic description
*  of something that doesn't exist,
*  but does any of that resonate in terms of how
*  you are thinking about or describing the self?
*  Yeah, yeah, there's a lot there.
*  First on the point of the brain being the locus
*  of what we are as minds, yeah, I mean there are people
*  who will insist that sort of the whole nervous system
*  has to be thought of as, when you're talking about
*  our emotional life and the insular connection to the gut
*  and the sense of self extends beyond the brain,
*  but I totally take your point that a brain transplant
*  is a coherent idea and you would expect to go with the brain
*  rather than with the viscera.
*  And so in that sense, we really are the old philosophical
*  thought experiment of being a brain and a vat.
*  I mean, we essentially are already, the vat is our skull
*  and we're virtually in that situation.
*  Horrible movie, I'm sorry, I can't help but interrupt.
*  When I was a teenager, my sister and I used to go
*  to the movies every once in a while,
*  we'd trade off who could pick the movie.
*  And she took me to see once the movie,
*  Boxing Helena, the David Lynch film.
*  I never saw that.
*  He amputates the limbs of a woman who he's obsessed by
*  and keeps her, it's a really horrible film.
*  And about 20 minutes into it, my sister just turned to me
*  and said, I'm so sorry.
*  And the question then was whether or not two siblings
*  should actually persist in a movie like that.
*  We decided to persist in the movie so that we could laugh
*  about it later, but it was rather disturbing.
*  I don't recommend the movie nor do I recommend seeing it
*  with a sibling, but in that movie, the woman,
*  he takes her as a container and restricts her movement,
*  quite sadistic and horrible thing really, David Lynch,
*  interesting mind perhaps, but the idea was that,
*  was to question how much of the person persists
*  in the absence of their ability to move, et cetera.
*  Could there be love?
*  Could there be these other affections?
*  Anyway, a rather extreme example,
*  but one that still haunts me
*  and I suppose I'm thinking about still now.
*  Well, so just to follow that point,
*  there's a lot about us that we don't have access to
*  unless we enact it physically.
*  Like, if I ask you, do you still know how to ride a bike?
*  There's no place in your memory where you can inspect
*  by just sitting in your chair that you've retained
*  the knowledge of how to ride a bike.
*  Like I said, procedural memory is different from semantic
*  or episodic memory.
*  If I asked you, do you know your address?
*  Yes, you can recall your address just sitting there,
*  but if you had had a micro stroke that neatly dissected out
*  your ability to ride a bike
*  and left everything else intact,
*  you might think you could ride a bike,
*  but suddenly you stand up next to one
*  and you have no idea what to do with it
*  and that would be a discovery that would only happen
*  if you were motorically engaged with that object.
*  And I'm sure there's,
*  we could probably come up with a hundred things about us
*  that really seem core to us and are not separable
*  from our personhood, which seem to only get invoked
*  when we're out there moving in the world
*  and we have limbs, et cetera.
*  But yeah, the seat of consciousness,
*  the right framework to talk about all of this
*  from my point of view is consciousness and its contents.
*  So we have consciousness,
*  the fact that there's something that is like to be us,
*  the fact that the world and our internal experience
*  is illuminated, that it has a qualitative character.
*  And then there's the question of
*  what is that qualitative character?
*  What kinds of information do we have access to?
*  What does it feel like to be us?
*  How do different states of arousal change that?
*  So you talked about fear.
*  Yeah, I mean, fear can change a lot of things,
*  and various neurological deficits,
*  or you can add drugs to the mix, you add psychedelics,
*  that radically transform the contents of consciousness.
*  From my point of view, consciousness itself
*  is simply the cognizance, the awareness,
*  is the floodlights by which any of that stuff appears.
*  So consciousness doesn't change, but its contents change.
*  And to come back to meditation for a second,
*  many people think meditation is about
*  changing the contents of consciousness.
*  There's some contents you wanna get rid of, like anxiety,
*  other contents you want to encourage, like calm,
*  and unconditional love, or some other classically pleasant,
*  pro-social emotion, and that's all fine, that's all possible.
*  But the real wisdom, the 2,000-year-old wisdom
*  of meditation that really is the chewy center
*  of the tootsie pop is a recognition
*  of what consciousness itself is always already like,
*  regardless of the contents and the changes in contents.
*  And this is why, and we might talk about this,
*  but this is why they're mutually compatible.
*  Psychedelics and meditation for me are somewhat orthogonal
*  because psychedelics is all about making wholesale changes
*  to the contents of consciousness.
*  And there's some wonderful consequences of doing that.
*  There can be some harrowing and terrifying consequences
*  of doing that, but generally speaking, I think,
*  used wisely, they can be incredibly valuable,
*  and the therapeutic potential there is enormous.
*  But the crucial disjunction here is that
*  there really is something to recognize
*  about ordinary waking consciousness,
*  the consciousness that's compatible with my driving a car
*  to get here on time.
*  You don't have to have the pyrotechnics of being on LSD
*  to transcend the central illusion
*  that I'm saying is the thing to be transcended,
*  which is the sense that there is a duality
*  between subject and object in every moment of experience.
*  And to take it back to something you said
*  about just all of our different modes in ordinary life,
*  the interesting thing is I think people are constantly
*  losing their sense of self, and they're not aware of it.
*  And there's probably an analogy to the visual system here,
*  which is to visual saccades, which perhaps you've spoken
*  about at some point on your podcast.
*  Not enough, so please.
*  Yeah, so what happens with our, every time we move our eyes,
*  this is called a saccade, and we do that about
*  three times a second or so, just normally.
*  There is a, the region of motor cortex
*  that affects that movement sends what's called
*  an efferent copy of that motor movement,
*  which is used as information that propagates back
*  to visual cortex that suppresses the data of vision
*  while the eyes are moving, because otherwise,
*  if you weren't doing that, every time you moved your eyes,
*  it would seem like the visual scene itself
*  was lurching around, and people can experience this
*  for themselves if they just touch one of their eyeballs
*  on the side, not all that hard, and kind of jiggle it,
*  and then you can roll it around,
*  you can jiggle it from side to side.
*  You can see that a movement of the eyeball
*  that's not governed by your ocular motor system
*  delivers a jiggling of the world, because it's not,
*  your brain is not anticipating it in the same way,
*  and you're not producing that same predictive copy
*  of the movement.
*  It's a little bit like,
*  we have some action sports filmers on our staff here,
*  the gimbal that holds an iPhone like you see the kids
*  on surfboards or skateboards or something,
*  they're gonna hold a phone while moving around,
*  or the people who, the vloggers,
*  does anyone even still use that for his vlog?
*  I don't know, yes.
*  Moving around into, it's image stabilization, essentially,
*  that keeps the camera steady,
*  and these are more than cameras, of course,
*  for those listening pointing at my eyes,
*  but they do far more than just what a camera would do,
*  but yeah, this internal system of image stabilization,
*  yeah, I can see perhaps where you're going with this,
*  that it allows us to remain in a self-referencing scheme,
*  as opposed to sort of paying attention
*  to just how confusing it is to track the visual world
*  at some level.
*  Well, actually, where I'm going is that,
*  so people are having this suppression of vision
*  three times a second on average,
*  and they're not experiencing it, right?
*  So you're literally like,
*  you're effectively going blind and you're not noticing it,
*  and...
*  It's very fast.
*  Yes, it's very fast.
*  Now, there's an analogous suppression, I would say,
*  of the sense of self that occurs
*  every time attention gets absorbed significantly
*  in its object, right?
*  So we even have this concept of losing yourself in your work,
*  or you're losing your...
*  I mean, the classic flow experiences have this quality,
*  where there's...
*  And this tends to be why they're so rewarding,
*  where there's just, if you're in some athletic activity,
*  or an aesthetic one,
*  or you could be having sex, or you could be...
*  Whatever it is, some peak experience,
*  its peakness usually entails
*  there being some brief period where
*  there was no distance between you and the experience, right?
*  For that moment, you were no longer
*  looking over your own shoulder,
*  or anticipating the next moment,
*  or trying to get somewhere where you weren't,
*  or micromanaging errors, or...
*  There's not a lot of...
*  There's just the flow of unity with
*  whatever the experience is,
*  a surfer on the wave, right?
*  And we love those experiences.
*  And then we are continually abstracted away from them
*  by our thinking about them.
*  We think, oh my God, that was so good,
*  or how do I get back to that?
*  Or you're looking at a sunset,
*  it's the most beautiful sunset you've ever seen,
*  and you're looking at a sunset,
*  it's the most beautiful sunset you've ever seen,
*  and then you're continually interrupting
*  the experience of merely seeing it
*  with a commentary about how amazing this is,
*  and I wonder, what are real estate prices here?
*  I mean, is it possible to actually move here?
*  And your mind is just continually narrating
*  a conversation you're having with yourself,
*  however paradoxically.
*  I mean, you're telling yourself things
*  that you already know,
*  as though there were two of you rather often, right?
*  Like, you're just, I'm looking for,
*  which is the water?
*  And I say, oh, there it is, right?
*  But I'm the one seeing it.
*  Who am I saying, oh, there it is too?
*  As though there's someone else who needs to be informed
*  about the thing I already saw, right?
*  So there's something about our internal dialogue
*  that is paradoxical.
*  Is there any neurologic condition,
*  colostalectomy or anything like that
*  where somehow people feel more unified with the self
*  on a continual basis, the observer and the actor within,
*  whether it, state more as a complete sentence,
*  is there any known neurological syndrome,
*  makes it sound like a bad thing, but it could be a good thing,
*  whereby people feel that the actor and the observer
*  within them are unified continually?
*  There's not a pathological one.
*  Some of the work on the default mode network
*  suggests that that's at least part of the story, right?
*  So the default mode network,
*  which has been talked about a lot of late
*  because it has come up both in the meditation literature
*  and in the psychedelic literature.
*  But its original discovery was that,
*  and the reason why it was called the default mode
*  was that in virtually every neuroimaging experiment ever run,
*  they found that between tasks,
*  when the brain was just in its default state,
*  these midline structures would increase their activity,
*  and then they would reliably diminish
*  whenever the person in the scanner was on task,
*  and usually that meant some kind of outward looking
*  visual discrimination task.
*  But it could be visual, it could be semantic,
*  it could be, but it tends to be their eyes are open
*  and they're paying attention to something
*  that's being broadcast to them through monitor goggles,
*  or they're looking at a mirror
*  that's showing them a computer monitor.
*  But so the general insight was,
*  there are these midline structures in the brain
*  that seem to be increasing their activity
*  when the brain is just kind of idling between tasks,
*  waiting for something to happen.
*  And then further experiments found tasks
*  that actually upregulated activity there beyond baseline.
*  And those tasks seem to be self-referential,
*  so that when you ask people, you give them a list of words
*  and you say, well, do any of these apply to you?
*  Or you ask people to think about,
*  actually in one experiment I did,
*  when you're challenging people's beliefs,
*  when you're challenging beliefs
*  that have more of a personal significance,
*  like political or religious beliefs,
*  you get an upregulation in these regions
*  as opposed to just generic beliefs about,
*  you're in Los Angeles, this is a table,
*  there's something to which people are not
*  holding fast as a matter of identity.
*  So anyway, both meditation and psychedelics
*  seem to suppress activity in these regions,
*  which we know are associated with both self-talk,
*  mind wandering, and explicit acts
*  of self-representation.
*  Could we say that they are somewhat autobiographical
*  because they access memory systems
*  and in the way you're describing them
*  and in the way that a colleague of mine,
*  who's been a guest on this podcast,
*  I don't know if you've interacted with him before,
*  but I think you'd very much enjoy
*  whatever interaction you would have as David Spiegel,
*  he's our Associate Chair of Psychiatry.
*  He and his father actually, his father then,
*  he founded hypnosis as a valid clinical practice
*  in psychiatry and hypnosis,
*  which is obviously a heightened sense of attention
*  with deep relaxation, is known to dramatically suppress
*  the default mode network.
*  He talks about this a lot and I always wonder
*  as we take down activity within the default mode network,
*  what surfaces in its place
*  and is what surfaces in its place,
*  does that somehow reflect that the two
*  are normally in a push-pull?
*  Because that's not necessarily the case, right?
*  When I fall asleep, I can hallucinate,
*  but that doesn't mean that during the day,
*  the fact that I'm looking at objects
*  is what's preventing me from hallucinating.
*  If I close my eyes, I can get imagery,
*  but there's this kind of a different illusion,
*  the illusion of antagonistic circuitry sometimes.
*  I don't wanna take us off course,
*  but the default mode network seems to want to be there,
*  it seems to be fighting for our attention,
*  unless we give ourselves a visual target
*  or an auditory target or some salient experience
*  of some kind, it sounds like.
*  And then if, I'm surprised to hear that meditation
*  reduces activity in the default mode network at some level
*  because meditation to me oftentimes involves
*  paying attention to some sort of perceptual target.
*  Maybe you could eventually explain as to
*  how it might do that or why it might.
*  Yeah, and I don't think it's the whole story
*  because obviously outward going attention is not,
*  even if you're having the kind of egoic saccade
*  that I'm talking about where you're like,
*  you're actually not clearly aware of yourself,
*  you're not clearly defining yourself
*  as separate from experience
*  for the moment of paying attention.
*  So you are sort of losing yourself in your work.
*  That's not the same thing as having
*  the clear meditative insight of selflessness
*  that I'm claiming is the goal of meditation.
*  But there is, to wind back to the original point
*  I was making and the reason why I drew the analogy
*  to visual saccades, I do think there's a continuous
*  interruption in our sense of self that goes unrecognized.
*  But the conscious acquisition of the understanding
*  that the self is an illusion is a different experience.
*  And it's, I mean, because you're then focusing
*  on this absence, actually there's another analogy
*  to the visual system that applies here,
*  which is to the optic blind spot.
*  I mean, it's like, so, which is a good analogy for me
*  because it cuts through a bunch of false assumption
*  as to where that you would look for this
*  or how this relates to ordinary experience.
*  So as many people know that we have, in both eyes,
*  we have what's called the blind spot,
*  which is a consequence of the optic nerve transiting
*  through the retina.
*  I mean, unlike cephalopods, I think,
*  I think cephalopods have their optic nerve
*  as an omniscient being would have engineered it,
*  connecting the retina from the back,
*  and therefore there is no blind,
*  the area of blindness associated with its transit
*  back through the retina.
*  Photoreceptors on the outside.
*  Exactly.
*  Humans, for whatever reason, put photoreceptors,
*  well, I always say, I wasn't consult the design phase.
*  Something put photoreceptors, combination of things,
*  put photoreceptors in the back,
*  and so you actually have to send the highway of information
*  through the pixel center of the eye.
*  Yeah, cephalopods and drosophila,
*  basically invertebrates.
*  Right.
*  The design is more at its face logical.
*  Mammals, very illogical design,
*  at least as far as our judgments go.
*  But it gives me a good analogy, so I'll take it.
*  I'd like to take a brief break
*  and acknowledge our sponsor, Athletic Greens.
*  Athletic Greens is an all-in-one
*  vitamin mineral probiotic drink
*  that also contains digestive enzymes and adaptogens.
*  I started taking Athletic Greens way back in 2012,
*  so that's 10 years now of taking Athletic Greens
*  every single day.
*  So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring this podcast.
*  The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
*  and the reason I still take Athletic Greens
*  is that it covers all of my foundational nutritional needs.
*  So whether or not I'm eating well or enough or not,
*  I'm sure that I'm covering all of my needs
*  for vitamins, minerals, probiotics, adaptogens
*  to combat stress, and the digestive enzymes
*  really help my digestion.
*  I just feel much better when I'm drinking Athletic Greens.
*  If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
*  you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman.
*  And for the month of January,
*  they have a special offer where they'll give you
*  10 free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2.
*  Vitamin D3 and K2 are vital for immune function,
*  metabolic function, hormone health,
*  but also calcium regulation and heart health.
*  Again, that's athleticgreens.com slash Huberman
*  to claim their special offer in the month of January
*  of 10 free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2.
*  So in any case, we have this blind spot,
*  which you can, I think most people learn this in school,
*  although my daughters had not been taught this in school.
*  I just showed them this for the first time like a month ago,
*  which, and they were briefly fascinated,
*  and then they wanna return to their screen time.
*  But anyway, you can take a piece of paper
*  and you make two marks on it, and then you cover one eye
*  and you fixate on one mark.
*  I mean, you can look this up online
*  if you need details about how to do this.
*  And while staring at one fixation point,
*  you move the paper back and forth,
*  and you can get it to a place
*  where the other mark disappears.
*  And you can run this experiment long enough
*  to satisfy yourself that there is in fact
*  a blind spot on your visual field,
*  which with one eye closed, you don't normally notice.
*  The reason why you have to cover one eye
*  is because each eye compensates
*  for the blind spot of the other.
*  But which is to say that if you close one eye
*  and survey the visual scene,
*  something really is missing, whatever you're looking at.
*  If you're looking at a crowd of people,
*  somebody is missing a head and you're not noticing it.
*  And it's not easy to notice because
*  the brain doesn't tend to vividly represent
*  the absence of information.
*  I mean, it's just part of the game that's not being rendered.
*  It's not showing up as a break in the visual field.
*  It's just not there.
*  And people have argued that there's a kind of
*  filling in phenomenon that happens,
*  but I think that can be misunderstood or exaggerated.
*  But the eye movements themselves that you described before,
*  I guess I should say that the saccade analogy
*  about transiently and repetitively erasing the self
*  works perfectly here because indeed micro saccades,
*  the smaller saccades occur all the time
*  also prevent our eyes from fixating at one location
*  long enough to observe our blind spot
*  even if one eye is closed.
*  So if we, the experiment's done with paralytics
*  to essentially lock eyes at one location,
*  basically things just start disappearing.
*  Yeah, it just basically.
*  We'd all love to think that we'd start hallucinating,
*  but actually we start going blind.
*  And those experiments have been done and on humans,
*  I hear they're quite terrifying.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  But I mean, you can do that for yourself too.
*  It just, it begins to just all melt away in a warm glow.
*  No psychedelics required.
*  But the interesting point there is that
*  when you ask yourself, okay, so this,
*  because as a consequence of the eyes anatomy,
*  there's this thing you can see
*  that is absent from your experience.
*  But the question is, where is that in relationship
*  to the rest of you, to your mind?
*  Is that deep within or is that in some sense
*  right on the surface of experience?
*  And there's expectation that people have,
*  again, I think conflating meditation
*  with a search for changes in the contents of consciousness,
*  they're looking for much more subtle things
*  to notice about the mind or much vaster things to notice.
*  Psychedelic sets up this expectation that you do
*  a massive dose of mushrooms or LSD and everything changes.
*  I mean, you just get this full beatific vision
*  and you get not only visual changes,
*  but emotional changes and you get synesthesia
*  where you have much more mind in so many ways.
*  So having these experiences
*  or reading the mystical literature,
*  you begin to think, okay, well then freedom
*  is really elsewhere or it's really, it's deep within.
*  It's like it's not coincident with the ordinary awareness
*  that can see this coffee cup clearly
*  and that can just transition attention to reading an email
*  with the full sobriety of ordinary waking consciousness.
*  But the truth is this insight into selflessness,
*  this insight into the non-duality of subject and object
*  is as close to ordinary consciousness
*  as this insight into the optic blind spot.
*  Like where do you have to go
*  to have this insight into the blind spot?
*  No, you just have to, if you're going anywhere,
*  you just have to set up the experiment correctly
*  such that you can see the data,
*  but the data's right on the surface.
*  It's almost too close to you to notice.
*  I mean, if it's at all hard to notice,
*  it's because it's so close
*  rather than it's deep within or far away.
*  And there are other analogies like,
*  I don't know if you remember those mind's eye
*  pieces of artwork that were the random dot stereograms
*  where you have an image that pops out.
*  I always find it very difficult to see those
*  because I have a very dominant eye.
*  But some people can't see those.
*  These are these images that used to be
*  at the kind of like touristy shops,
*  but people would say, oh, there it is, the whale.
*  And I'm thinking, I don't see it.
*  Kids that swim a lot when they're younger
*  and then I tend to breathe just to one side.
*  I don't know if this was you.
*  This was definitely me.
*  You tend to, will keep one eye closed.
*  You set up a pretty strong ocular dominance.
*  Biasing your vision to one or the other eye early in life,
*  whether or not you're learning how to be a bow hunter
*  or you're learning how to throw darts or shoot billiards
*  or anything involves selectively viewing the world
*  through one eye for even a couple of hours
*  can set up a permanent asymmetry
*  in the weighting of visual flow,
*  flow of visual information from the eye to the brain.
*  It's reversible, but only through the reverse gymnastics
*  of covering up the other eye intentionally.
*  So I actually, I had to be reverse patched for a while
*  because I was seeing double because I lost binocular vision.
*  I don't stand a chance in hell
*  of seeing an image pop out of random stereo group,
*  which is kind of ironic
*  because I did my PhD on binocular circuitry.
*  But nonetheless, if people can see these
*  or if they can't,
*  I think they provide a really terrific example
*  of what you're talking about as a larger theme,
*  which is that perceptually you see a bunch of dots
*  and then all of a sudden what you thought wasn't there
*  is suddenly there, but can disappear again.
*  Or there are certain visual illusions,
*  if we were to include others,
*  that once you see them, you cannot unsee them.
*  So there's the faces, vases, figure ground type stuff.
*  Yeah, it's a bit bistable percepts.
*  Yeah, bistable percepts.
*  And then there's sort of ocular competition.
*  You show two different images to the eyes,
*  to each of the two eyes.
*  It is near impossible for people
*  to perceive them both simultaneously.
*  So it's a little bit of what you're describing.
*  I mean, these seem to be fundamental features
*  about the way the neural circuits are organized,
*  that they don't want to stay fixated
*  on any one thing for very long.
*  To do so either takes training, intense interest,
*  intense fear, intense excitement.
*  When I say intense, I guess I come back to this idea
*  that the autonomic nervous system
*  is somehow governing our ability to spotlight
*  at any one location for very long.
*  Is that a useful framework,
*  or is that gonna take us down a different path?
*  It's sort of a different path for this.
*  I mean, the only point I was making
*  is that the seemingly paradoxical claim
*  that something can be right on the surface
*  and yet hard to see, right?
*  So there are things that are,
*  because it's, and again, this seems to justify
*  the expectation held by, I would think,
*  the vast majority of people who get interested
*  in these spiritual things, for lack of a better word,
*  that the truth must somehow be deep within, right?
*  There's really like a, there's some distance
*  between where you're, between the one who is looking
*  and the thing that has to be found, right?
*  And you have to go through this long evolution of changes.
*  I mean, there are many metaphors that set this up.
*  It's like you're at the base of a mountain
*  and you have to climb to the top.
*  And so you have to find the path,
*  however secure it is, to get you there.
*  But there really is a distance between where you're,
*  between your starting point and the goal.
*  And what I'm arguing, and this is a kind of a non-dual,
*  to use a term of jargon,
*  is a non-dual approach to meditation
*  as opposed to a dualistic one,
*  that there really is a,
*  the path and the goal are coincident, right?
*  That there's a, that you have to unravel the logic
*  by which you would seek something that's outside of,
*  the present moment's experience,
*  i.e. not available, really not available to you now.
*  Because so many things worth having,
*  so many skills worth acquiring
*  really are not available to you now.
*  It's like, if you wanna be a pianist
*  or if you wanna speak Chinese, or if you want,
*  there's something you don't know
*  and then you wanna learn that thing
*  and there's a whole process, right?
*  And you might not be capable of doing it, right?
*  You might, and real mastery is far away, right?
*  If you've never hit a golf ball
*  and you wanna hit a golf ball 300 yards straight, right?
*  I can pretty much guarantee
*  you're not gonna do that initially
*  and you're not gonna do it on day two
*  and you're not gonna do it reliably for the longest time.
*  And there's real training in front of you
*  to be able to do that reliably.
*  An insight into, and really the core insight,
*  the insight that is the core of the Buddha's teaching,
*  to take one historical example of this,
*  really is available now and it is not,
*  granted, it can be very hard won for people.
*  I mean, I had probably spent a year on silent retreat
*  in one week to three month increments
*  before I sort of got the point I'm making now, right?
*  So like, I mean, literally, and these are retreats
*  where you spend 12 to 18 hours a day just meditating,
*  trying to unpack the kinds of claims I'm making now.
*  So it's possible to rigorously overlook this.
*  It's possible to stand in front of the mind's eye image
*  and stare in a way that is guaranteed
*  not to give you pop out, right?
*  And to be adept at staring in that way.
*  So it's possible to be misled.
*  And so what I'm trying to argue here is that there's,
*  there's a fair amount of leverage you can get
*  with better information, which can kind of cut
*  the time core of the Buddha's teaching.
*  The time course of you are searching for this thing
*  and kind of cancel your false expectations
*  about just where this is in relation
*  to your ordinary waking consciousness.
*  And it's possible to get bad information
*  and to have a bunch of experiences.
*  You go and do an Ayahuasca trip
*  and you have, it's incredibly valuable.
*  And it's valuable for all the ways in which it changed
*  the contents of your consciousness in startling ways.
*  And you had insights into your past
*  and into your relationships and into why you're
*  in a way that you might be.
*  And there's lots to think about.
*  And you're like, okay, that's all great.
*  That's all something that we can talk about.
*  But there is, it truly is orthogonal.
*  And if it makes a point of contact
*  to what I'm talking about, it's really just at one point.
*  And it's at the point where this sense
*  of subject-object division in consciousness
*  is illusory and vulnerable to investigation.
*  And if you investigate it,
*  it's a plane of focus.
*  You pick the analogy you want from,
*  whether it's setting up the optic blind spot experiment
*  in just the right way so that you can see
*  that it's actually not, the data is not there.
*  I mean, the bistable percept is great because
*  when you see one of these images,
*  like the vase-face diagram or the Dalmatian
*  that looks like just a mess of dots,
*  and then you see the image of a Dalmatian dog pop out.
*  Once you see it, you really can't unsee it.
*  I mean, once you have the requisite conceptual anchor to it,
*  then every time you look, you're gonna find it again,
*  and eventually it becomes effortless.
*  And that's what ultimately meditation is.
*  I mean, this kind of meditation,
*  you ultimately learn to recognize
*  that there's no separation from you
*  between you and your experience.
*  There's not the experience on the one hand
*  and the self on the other.
*  There's just experience.
*  There's just seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching,
*  thinking, feeling, proprioception,
*  add whatever channels of information you want to that.
*  But there's just the totality of the energy
*  of consciousness and its contents.
*  And there's no, it's not that you're on the riverbank,
*  and this is how it can seem in the beginning,
*  even when you're practicing meditation fairly diligently.
*  It can seem like you're on the riverbank
*  watching the contents of consciousness flow by.
*  And meditation is the act of doing that
*  more and more dispassionately.
*  So you're no longer grabbing at the pleasant
*  or pushing the unpleasant away.
*  You're just kind of relaxing
*  and in the most non-judgmental frame of mind,
*  just witnessing the flow, right?
*  But if you're doing that dualistically,
*  you feel like the meditator.
*  You feel like the subject aiming attention.
*  And so now you're on the riverbank
*  watching everything go past.
*  But the truth is you are the river, right?
*  Experience itself is, there is just experience itself.
*  You're not on the edge of experience.
*  And everything you can notice is part of the flow, right?
*  And there's no point from which
*  to abstract yourself away from the flow,
*  to stand outside it and to say,
*  okay, this is my life, this is my experience,
*  this is my body.
*  Yes, you can do that.
*  I mean, those are all just thoughts,
*  but that's more of the flow, right?
*  And so there's a process by which
*  you would eventually recognize that
*  there's no distance between you and your experience.
*  And again, you can wait for those moments in life
*  where experience gets so good or so terrifying,
*  or just so salient, right?
*  Your amygdala is driving so hard.
*  I mean, so you're in a war,
*  and you can't think about anything
*  because the enemy's shooting at you,
*  and this is the most thrilling video game
*  you've ever played in your life,
*  and your life is on the line.
*  Or you're at the peak of some athletic event
*  where there's just, you don't know how you're doing
*  the things you're doing,
*  but it's all happening automatically, right?
*  But those are one-one-hundredth of 1% of one's life,
*  and what I'm calling meditation is a way of simply
*  understanding the mechanics of attention
*  whereby you are denying yourself
*  that unity of experience so much of the time,
*  and recognizing that it's based on a misperception
*  of the way consciousness always already is.
*  Well, if there wasn't an incentive
*  to learn how to meditate properly,
*  that was one.
*  And I've been meditating a fair amount
*  since I was in my teens,
*  but more along the lines of just paying attention
*  to breath and recognize thought sort of observer,
*  open observer type meditation or focused attention,
*  I would suppose more of the focused attention type.
*  We'll get into these a little bit later,
*  but I have a number of questions
*  related to what you just said.
*  Sure.
*  I love the idea that this thing that we would all do well
*  to understand, to observe consciousness itself
*  as opposed to trying to alter the contents of consciousness
*  may sit much closer to us than one might think.
*  Because it sits so close to us,
*  that might be one of the reasons why we miss it.
*  I go right to a visual system example.
*  I mean, if you're wearing corrective lenses
*  and there's a speck on your lens,
*  typically you're looking out through the lens
*  and so you wouldn't observe that speck.
*  Any number of different analogies could work here.
*  The fact that there are states,
*  however few positive and negative,
*  extreme ecstasy and extreme fear
*  being the two I think most obvious ones
*  that seems like we agree on
*  that allow us to capture the sense of completeness of self
*  or the unity of the observer and the actor.
*  The fact that those are seldom for the non-trained,
*  for the non-meditator suggests to me two things.
*  I think one perhaps worth exploring more than the other,
*  but one is that what's really being revealed in the states
*  where we can feel the unity of the observer and the actor
*  is understanding something fundamental about the algorithm,
*  not the online algorithm,
*  but the algorithm that is our nervous system.
*  Just as you mentioned cephalopods,
*  I mean mantis shrimp see an enormous array of color hues
*  that we don't, right?
*  Their maps and representations of the world
*  are fundamentally different.
*  Pit viper see in the infrared.
*  We're restricted to somewhat of a limited range
*  within the color spectrum,
*  but still more vast than that of dogs or cats.
*  Okay, so understanding that for seeing what a pit viper
*  can see for moments would be informative perhaps,
*  sensing heat emissions as a human might be invasive
*  and maybe that's why we don't do it.
*  So the question is, to just make it straightforward is,
*  why would the system be designed this way?
*  Again, neither of us were to consult at the design phase,
*  but that brings me to perhaps the more tractable question
*  which is about development.
*  I mean, I'm a great believer that the neural circuits
*  that encouraged healthy parent-child relations
*  or unhealthy parent-child relations as the case may be,
*  in childhood stem from the initial demands
*  of internal versus external states,
*  which is exactly what we're talking about,
*  which is that a young child feels anxious
*  because it needs its diaper changed.
*  It doesn't really know it needs its diaper changed
*  or it's cold, or it's uncomfortable, or it's hungry,
*  or it's overly full.
*  And so it vocalizes and then some external source
*  comes to us and relieves that hopefully.
*  And so the fundamental rule that we first learn
*  is not that we have a cell for that things fall down,
*  not up, but is that when uncomfortable,
*  externalize that discomfort
*  and it will be relieved by an outside player.
*  And then of course, there's a repurposing of that circuitry
*  for adult romantic attachments.
*  I don't think anyone doubts that.
*  And that can explain a lot indeed about attachment
*  and so forth.
*  So something about our developmental wiring
*  and the algorithms that these neural circuits run
*  tend to bias most people, the non-practice meditators,
*  to live a somewhat functional life at least
*  without this awareness of actor and observer.
*  And so what you're really talking about
*  is a deliberate intervention to understand
*  and resolve that gap in the algorithm.
*  Do I have that right?
*  I'm more or less restating what you said in a way
*  that I'm hoping will serve as a jumping off point
*  as to why questions are always very dangerous in biology
*  or any, you know.
*  Or in relationship.
*  What's that?
*  Or in relationship.
*  Or in relationship, right, exactly.
*  Although I think it all does really harken back
*  to this early developmental wiring,
*  which of course is modifiable.
*  That's the beauty of the nervous system
*  is it's the one organ that seems to be able to change itself
*  at least to some degree.
*  So what are your thoughts about the organization
*  of the circuitry to essentially under normal conditions
*  to not reveal what seems to be one of its more important
*  and profound and for, dare I say, enlightening features?
*  It's almost as if we are potentially like mantis shrimp.
*  We can see so many more colors than we actually see
*  and yet we don't.
*  We sort of opt, most people opt not to.
*  And I would argue that one of the great strengths
*  of the waking up app, for instance,
*  that it essentially walks you through the process
*  of being able to arrive at these things
*  without having to go to one year or three year
*  long silent meditation retreats.
*  So if you could just elaborate for a moment
*  before we move on about, you know,
*  what are your thoughts about how the circuitry
*  is arranged by default versus,
*  and what that means for there to be an intervention
*  that we have to intervene in the self
*  in order to reveal the self.
*  Well, so the two big questions there,
*  one about evolution, one about development.
*  So with respect to evolution, I mean,
*  it's important to recognize that evolution
*  doesn't see our deepest concerns about human flourishing
*  and human wellbeing, you know.
*  It's all about the office.
*  It's just, you know, we are set up to spawn
*  and to survive long enough to help our progeny spawn
*  if we can do that, and that's it, right.
*  And so anything that was good for that,
*  including, you know, tribalism and xenophobia
*  and, you know, all kinds of hardware and software flaws
*  that reveal themselves to be flaws in the present time
*  when we're trying to build a viable global civilization,
*  but, you know, they redounded to the advantage
*  of our ancestors somehow, or they just,
*  there are things about us that we're simply not selected for.
*  They just kind of came along for the ride,
*  you know, what Stephen Jay Gould called a spandrel, you know.
*  So we are not set up by evolution
*  to be as happy as we possibly can be,
*  and to do almost anything that interests us well.
*  I mean, we're not set up by evolution
*  to be mathematicians or musicians
*  or to create democracies that are healthy.
*  I mean, evolution can see none of this,
*  and we're doing these things based on cognitive
*  and emotional hardware
*  that we are leveraging in new directions, right.
*  I mean, we are primates,
*  and we're communicating with small mouth noises.
*  I mean, we're language using primates,
*  and all of that has clearly evolved,
*  and we're doing these amazing things, including science,
*  however improbably, we're actually able to,
*  you know, almost entirely with language,
*  understand reality at a scale
*  that exceeds us in both directions.
*  I mean, the very vast and the very small,
*  and also temporally, the very old.
*  We have visions of the far future,
*  and we can figure out where an asteroid
*  is gonna cross Earth's orbit 1,000 years from now
*  if we just do the math,
*  and it's amazing that we can do all of those things,
*  but evolution is blind to all of that, right.
*  And so we have, in terms of what we care about,
*  and certainly in terms of what's gonna ensure
*  our survival as a species,
*  we have flown the perch that was created for us by evolution.
*  I mean, it's not just the primate things,
*  and so it is with learning how to regulate our emotions
*  and punch through to a self-concept,
*  or beyond a self-concept
*  that is more normative psychologically,
*  that allows us to not be terrorized by our apish genes
*  as fully as we seem to be,
*  even in the presence of more and more destructive technology.
*  That, I mean, we're still practically chimpanzees
*  armed with nuclear weapons, right,
*  and that is increasingly dysfunctional.
*  And very soon we're gonna be in the presence of minds
*  or apparent minds that we have built
*  that are as intelligent as we are,
*  and very quickly, probably 15 minutes after that,
*  far more intelligent than we are.
*  And so what we do with all of that
*  is, again, something that we have to figure out
*  based on the minds we have, the minds we can build,
*  the minds we can change.
*  We can meddle with our own genomes now,
*  and that will produce its own consequences
*  in ourselves and in future generations
*  if we meddle with the germ line.
*  And again, all of that is just,
*  evolution is just sort of the womb we came out of,
*  but it didn't anticipate any of that, right?
*  So Mother Nature has simply not had
*  our best interests at heart, right?
*  And we might die off, and from the point of view
*  of Mother Nature, that's fine,
*  because 99% of every species dies off.
*  So there's that.
*  But when you're talking about the individual developmentally,
*  so we all come into this world, again,
*  as a fairly hairless primate
*  that needs a tremendous amount of care by others.
*  And the logic of that is that
*  the reason why we're not a gazelle
*  that can run 45 minutes later
*  and then basically do all the gazelle things perfectly
*  soon thereafter, the reason why we have
*  we have this time of immaturity,
*  and that has become functional for us,
*  is that we're far more flexible,
*  and we can learn based on the needs of an environment
*  to do so much more than a gazelle can.
*  And language is a part of that,
*  and in the last 10,000 years or so,
*  culture increasingly has been more and more a part of that,
*  and there's probably a layer at which we can plausibly
*  talk about cultural evolution,
*  and cultural evolution interacting
*  with biological evolution to change us.
*  But when you're talking about the development
*  of an individual, each of us comes into this world,
*  I think, not recognizing ourselves
*  in any sense that would make sense to reify.
*  I mean, it's not that there's nothing there.
*  I mean, there could be some kind
*  of proto-self differentiation,
*  but I think it takes a long while,
*  and there is very likely a coincidence
*  between really recognizing others.
*  We recognize others first,
*  and we're certainly in relationship immediately,
*  and we orient to human faces,
*  and we even detect other humans
*  as good and bad moral actors very early,
*  I mean, certainly long before
*  we recognize ourselves in a mirror.
*  Experiments run, again, this is Paul Bloom
*  and colleagues, experiments run on the moral hardware
*  and software of developing toddlers,
*  but I think at this point, they push it down
*  all the way to six months of age
*  where you'll get these infants staring at a puppet show,
*  and they'll show a greater interest
*  in classically good actors versus bad actors,
*  cooperators versus defectors in various puppet show games.
*  So it's not that we have no mind
*  and no proto-awareness of others and of self,
*  but what eventually happens,
*  certainly as we become at all facile with language use,
*  is that we become aware that not only are we
*  in relationship to others,
*  but we are an object in the world for them, right?
*  So that we have enough people pointing at us in our cribs
*  and impinging upon our experience, right?
*  You're being physically moved and prodded and touched
*  and consoled or not consoled,
*  and just imagine what all of these,
*  you're on the receiving end of 10,000 interventions,
*  and you're completely helpless for the longest time,
*  and all of that attention,
*  you have all of these people coming up to the crib
*  and making faces at you.
*  Cheering for you.
*  Yeah, and it's all pointed at you, right?
*  So there's a classic magical narcissism
*  that gets constructed there.
*  If you take the psychological literature,
*  at least a certain strand of it, seriously,
*  and I think it's largely apt to think of a child at that age
*  as a kind of,
*  there is a kind of narcissistic structure there
*  where it's all kind of going inward,
*  and at a certain point you realize,
*  okay, I'm the center of all of this, right?
*  It's not just a movie that you're completely absorbed in,
*  and you've lost your sense of self.
*  I mean, this is to talk about yet another example of
*  what it's like as a grownup to lose our sense of self,
*  and one of the things I think we find so fascinating
*  about television and film is that
*  when we get totally absorbed in it,
*  we're in this very unusual circumstance where we're,
*  our brain is basically reading it
*  as we're in the classic social circumstance.
*  We're presented with the facial displays of other people.
*  In fact, sometimes these people are 10 feet tall,
*  and they're just sitting there,
*  sometimes these people are 10 feet tall, right,
*  or their faces are 10 feet tall.
*  You leave a close-up in a movie theater,
*  so it's like this super stimulus in terms of evolution,
*  and they could be making direct eye contact with a camera,
*  so you have this gigantic face staring at you,
*  and yet you're totally unimplicated socially.
*  You can't be seen, and something about that,
*  you know you can't be seen,
*  and so you completely lose self-consciousness,
*  and yet you're able to examine
*  with completely free attention,
*  again, because you're totally unimplicated,
*  the facial minutia and the mimetic facial play of people
*  at a very close range.
*  I mean, you're seeing people close,
*  I mean, you'd have to be physically just,
*  about to kiss your spouse,
*  like that's what a close-up is in a film, right?
*  You never get that close to people, right?
*  And yet here you're in a situation
*  where you're unobserved, and you know that,
*  and so, I mean, this is a bit of a tangent,
*  but it's the other side
*  of what's happening developmentally for a kid.
*  When you're in a movie theater watching a movie,
*  you are truly invisible, and yet you're right there,
*  seeing, however harrowing the human drama is,
*  you're seeing it play out, and you're seeing it up close,
*  and it is in principle a social encounter
*  that your genes are ready for,
*  but they're not ready for you to be invisible, right?
*  And so that's what's so magical about it.
*  But what happens developmentally for a kid
*  is that you're not invisible,
*  you are an object that is constantly being overrun.
*  The boundaries of your sensory engagement with the world
*  are constantly being impinged upon by others,
*  and at a certain point you recognize,
*  okay, I'm at the center of this,
*  and the way this gets enshrined as a self,
*  I think is probably coincident
*  with our learning the language game
*  we learn to play with others.
*  We're talking to others, people are talking to us,
*  and at a certain point, we're talking to ourselves
*  even when the other people leave the room, right?
*  So, and you can hear, if you ever have been with a toddler,
*  when they're externalizing their self-talk,
*  you hear them talking to themselves,
*  they're playing and they're having a conversation,
*  they were talking to you, the parent,
*  but then you left the room and they're still talking,
*  you come back in and they're still talking, right?
*  And what happens to us, strangely,
*  and this comes back to the logic of evolution,
*  we never stop because evolution never thought
*  to build us an off switch for this, right?
*  Language is so useful, and it gets tuned up
*  so strongly for us, and there was never a reason
*  to shut it off, right?
*  There was never a reason to give you this ability
*  to say, oh, it wouldn't be nice to have four hours
*  of quiet now, like no self-talk.
*  And so for most of us, I mean, I think there are people
*  who, for whatever neurological reason
*  or idiosyncratic reason, undoubtedly,
*  there'd be a neurological reason for it,
*  don't have any self-talk.
*  But for most of us, we are covertly talking
*  basically all the time, and there's an imagistic component
*  of this for many people, you're visualizing things as well,
*  but there's just a ton of white noise in the mind
*  that feels a certain way.
*  And what you discover in meditation, ultimately,
*  is that the self is what it feels like to be thinking
*  without knowing that you're thinking, right?
*  A thought arises, uninspected, and seems to just become you.
*  So like you and I are talking now,
*  and people are listening to us.
*  They're struggling to follow the train of this conversation
*  because it is competing with the conversation
*  that's happening in their heads, right?
*  So I'll be saying something, and a person listening
*  will say, well, what does that mean?
*  Or like, oh, but wait a minute, he just contradicted himself.
*  Or like, and there's a voice in your head
*  that is also vying for your attention much of the time.
*  And so the first discovery people make in meditation
*  is that it's just so hard to pay attention to anything,
*  the breath or a mantra or a sound, whatever it is,
*  because you're thinking about the thing you need to do
*  in an hour, and oh, it's so good that I downloaded this app.
*  I'm like, oh, this is really good.
*  This is gonna be good for me.
*  But that chatter isn't showing up.
*  You're not far back enough in the theater of consciousness
*  so as to see it emerge.
*  It is just sneaking up behind you,
*  and it feels like me again.
*  It feels like when someone is thinking the thought,
*  well, what the hell does that mean, right?
*  They're not seeing it as an emerging object
*  in consciousness.
*  It just feels like me.
*  It just feels, subjectively, it's like the mind contracts
*  around this appearance in consciousness.
*  And it really is just, it's just a sound
*  with the voice of the mind.
*  If you actually can inspect it,
*  it is deeply inscrutable that we ever feel identified
*  with our thoughts.
*  I mean, how is it that we could be a thought?
*  These thoughts, a thought just arises and passes away,
*  and when you go to inspect it, it unravels.
*  It's the least substantial possible thing.
*  And yet it could be a thought of self-hatred.
*  It could be a thought that unrecognized
*  totally defines your mood.
*  It's like, I mean, just again,
*  this all can seem kind of abstract, but.
*  But I think it's extremely concrete
*  from the perspective of the neural circuits
*  that we'll return to maybe in a few minutes.
*  I'd like to take a brief break
*  and thank our sponsor, InsideTracker.
*  InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
*  that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
*  to help you better understand your body
*  and help you reach your health goals.
*  I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
*  for the simple reason that many of the factors
*  that impact your immediate and long-term health
*  can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.
*  The problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests out there,
*  however, is that you get data back about metabolic factors,
*  lipids and hormones and so forth,
*  but you don't know what to do with those data.
*  InsideTracker solves that problem
*  and makes it very easy for you to understand
*  what sorts of nutritional, behavioral,
*  maybe even supplementation-based interventions
*  you might want to take on in order to adjust the numbers
*  of those metabolic factors, hormones, lipids,
*  and other things that impact your immediate
*  and long-term health.
*  To bring those numbers into the ranges
*  that are appropriate and indeed optimal for you.

*  If you could elaborate a bit on this notion
*  of internal chatter and external stimuli
*  and the bridge between them,
*  because I think that for some people that might be intuitive.
*  I think for others, it's not so obvious
*  that language is ongoing in the backdrop.
*  Because sometimes, I think some people
*  are more tuned into that language.
*  For some people, it's louder volume.
*  For some people, it's more structured.
*  I have a colleague at Stanford who's been on this podcast
*  called Diceroth, who's one of the preeminent bioengineers.
*  He's also a psychiatrist,
*  and he doesn't call it a meditative practice.
*  He has a practice where each evening,
*  after his five kids are put down to sleep,
*  they're older now.
*  But in the quiet of the late hours of the night,
*  early morning, he sits and forces himself to think
*  in complete sentences with punctuation for an hour.
*  This is the way that he has taught himself
*  to structure his thinking
*  because of the very fact that you're describing,
*  which is that ordinarily, there is an underlying structure
*  to what's internal, but it's disrupted by external events.
*  And typically, it's not coherent enough
*  to really make meaning from.
*  So it's almost like somebody sitting down
*  to write in complete sentences,
*  but forcing himself to do it in his head.
*  But for many people, including myself,
*  that's a foreign experience,
*  and we only experience structure through our interactions
*  with the world and other people.
*  That I've taken the time to try and explore ideas
*  with eyes closed.
*  And I've been able to do that.
*  There are certain pharmacologic states
*  that we could talk about that facilitate that.
*  And no, those are not amphetamines.
*  Those do exactly the opposite, by the way.
*  But I think people exist in varying degrees
*  of structured and unstructured internal dialogue
*  and in varying depths of recognition
*  of that internal dialogue.
*  And so the question I suppose is,
*  is just the recognition that there's a dialogue
*  ongoing internally, is that itself valuable?
*  Yeah, and that also can take some time.
*  So here's a claim I would make
*  that some people might find surprising,
*  but I think this is an objectively true claim
*  about the subjectivity of most people,
*  which is that unless you have a fair amount of training,
*  unless you just happen to be some kind of savant
*  in this area, which most people, by definition,
*  aren't, or you have a remarkable amount of training
*  in what's called concentration practice in meditation,
*  I believe this is a true claim that if we just put
*  a stopwatch on this table and people could just watch it,
*  30 seconds elapse, and I said all of our listeners
*  or your viewers the task, for the next 30 seconds,
*  just pay attention to anything, your breath,
*  or the sight of your hand or the sight of the clock
*  or any object without getting lost in thought,
*  without getting momentarily distracted
*  by this conversation you're having with yourself.
*  This couple things would happen.
*  One is no one would be able to do it, right?
*  And not just, this is not just a superficial inability
*  I mean, if your life depended on it,
*  you wouldn't be able to do it.
*  I mean, if the fate of civilization depended on it,
*  none of our listeners would be able to do this.
*  And yet some percentage of them are so distracted by thought
*  that they will actually try this experiment
*  and think they succeeded, right?
*  And for these people, what happens is you put them
*  on a meditation retreat and you have them spend
*  12 hours a day in silence doing nothing but this, right?
*  But the goal is that the audience
*  or the audience of the practices just pay attention
*  to the breath when they're sitting and then eventually
*  you incorporate everything, sounds and other sensations.
*  And then you interleave that with walking meditation
*  where they're paying attention just to the sensations
*  of lifting and moving and placing their feet.
*  And then once the practice is going,
*  you incorporate sounds and sights and everything.
*  So you can pay attention to everything,
*  but the goal is for every moment
*  you're going to cultivate this faculty of mind,
*  which increasingly is known as mindfulness, right?
*  So, and mindfulness is nothing other than
*  this very careful attention to the contents of consciousness.
*  But the crucial piece is it is not a moment
*  of being lost in thought, right?
*  You're not blocking thoughts.
*  Thoughts themselves can arise,
*  but in those moments of being truly mindful,
*  you're noticing thoughts as thoughts,
*  whether it's language in the mind
*  or images, you're noticing those too
*  as spontaneous appearances in consciousness.
*  So, if most people, certainly anyone who thinks
*  they can pay attention to,
*  you know, they can do the experiment successfully
*  that I just suggested, pay attention to something
*  for 30 seconds without being lost in thought,
*  you put those people on a meditation retreat,
*  what they're going to experience is,
*  you know, on the first day, they're going to feel like,
*  oh yeah, I was with the breath or I was walking,
*  I was with the sensations of walking,
*  and I'd be there for like five minutes, you know, solid,
*  and then I would get lost in thought, then I'd come back,
*  and then, you know, five more minutes,
*  I'd be lost in thought, then I'd get back.
*  But as the days progressed, you know,
*  even 10 days into a silent meditation retreat,
*  they're going to experience more and more distraction.
*  They're going to, it's going to seem like,
*  okay, wait a minute, now I can't pay attention
*  to anything for more than five seconds, right?
*  That is progress, right?
*  Because what they're discovering
*  is just how distractible they are, right?
*  And, you know, so for some people,
*  that will be immediately obvious,
*  for some people, it'll actually take a lot of practice
*  to realize just how distracted they are.
*  What you just said, which was that at some point,
*  we can start noticing our thoughts,
*  I can notice my thoughts,
*  but what you're talking about as a goal state
*  is not being distracted by thoughts,
*  but actually seeing the relationship
*  between thoughts, self, and other types of perceptions.
*  And here, I think recognizing and seeing thoughts
*  is a form of perception,
*  it's just an internally directed perception.
*  This raises a topic that I'm also obsessed by,
*  which I think neuroscience can somewhat explain,
*  but still incomplete, incompletely,
*  the circuits and mechanics, et cetera, are not yet known,
*  which is about time perception.
*  And, you know, a simple analogy would be
*  that there are a lot of small objects flying around
*  in the space that we happen to be having this discussion,
*  but they're moving so fast that I can't perceive them.
*  Or they're entirely stationary, so I can't perceive them
*  because of the reasons we talked about before
*  in the visual system.
*  My eyes are moving in perfect concert
*  with these small object movements,
*  and therefore, I am blind to them.
*  A slight shift in time perception,
*  think of this perhaps as a change in the frame rate,
*  camera frame rates, faster frame rate,
*  you can capture slow motion, slower frame rate,
*  you're gonna get more of a strobe type effect
*  if the frame rate is low enough.
*  Right?
*  Could it be that our time perception is not one thing,
*  but we have one rate of perceiving time
*  for external objects at a given distance,
*  which we know is true, another frame rate for objects
*  that are up close, we know this to be true,
*  even if those objects are moving
*  at the exact same speed, right?
*  I mean, this would be the sitting on a train,
*  the rungs on the fence seem to be going by very, very fast,
*  but the ones in the distance seem to be moving slowly.
*  This is the way the visual system
*  and time perception interconnect at some level.
*  You're up on a skyscraper, the little ants of cars
*  and people down below, you know they're moving much faster
*  than you perceive them to move,
*  but it's a distance effect.
*  I mean, you see a plane,
*  it's gonna be going 300 miles an hour.
*  Exactly.
*  And it's not because of the lack of resolution,
*  the lack of resolution is incidental.
*  We know this because in animals such as hawks
*  that have twice the degree of acuity,
*  as far as we know, they have the same
*  distance associated shifts in time perception.
*  So could it be that we are running multiple streams
*  of time perception, multiple cones of attention
*  that include cones of attention to our thoughts
*  and that somehow through meditation,
*  we start to align the frame rate
*  for these different streams of attention
*  so that they all fall into the same movie, if you will,
*  although it's not just a movie with visual content.
*  What I'm doing here is clearly I'm becoming a lumper
*  rather than a splitter.
*  I'm sure this violates certain rules of time perception
*  and neural circuitry,
*  but I'm not sure that it's entirely untrue either.
*  And does it survive at all as a possible model
*  for what you're describing?
*  And if the answer is no,
*  I'm perfectly comfortable with that.
*  Well, it's dependent on what you mean by meditation.
*  This is where you sort of the particularities
*  of what one is doing with one's attention
*  under the frame of meditation really matter
*  because there are ways to practice
*  where, practice mindfulness in particular,
*  where the frame rate really does seem to go way, way up.
*  Right, and there's actually been some research done on this
*  where you take people before and after
*  a three month silent meditation retreat
*  and you give them some kind of visual discrimination task
*  where they have to like detect,
*  I think they used a tachistoscope, is that the tool for it?
*  There's some, something that presents
*  like very quick pulses of light.
*  And in any case, you can discriminate
*  just in any sensory channel I would imagine,
*  you can make finer grain discriminations
*  if you're practicing mindfulness in a very specific way,
*  which is to be making these fine grain discriminations
*  more and more and do nothing else
*  for three months, which is a way of practicing.
*  So you're, so the classic mindfulness practice
*  in what's called Vipassana meditation
*  is to pay scrupulous attention to seeing, hearing,
*  smelling, tasting, touching in a way that
*  breaks everything down into this kind of
*  microscopic sensory moments.
*  So you're, rather than feel your hands pressing together,
*  what you're trying to feel with your attention
*  and you're feeling more and more is
*  all of the micro sensations of pressure
*  and temperature and movement
*  such that the feeling of hands completely disappears.
*  You realize that the hand is a concept
*  and all you have is this cloud of punctate
*  and very brief sensations.
*  And so anything you think you have
*  as a datum of experience,
*  as you bore into it with your attention,
*  it resolves into this kind of
*  diaphanous cloud of changing sensation.
*  And that can be even something as captivating
*  as like a serious pain in your body.
*  I mean, you could have injured your neck
*  and so you have some excruciating pain in your neck.
*  If you just are willing to pay attention to it
*  and just pay 100% attention to it,
*  a couple of things happen.
*  One is your resistance to feeling it
*  goes away by definition
*  because now your goal is just pay attention to it.
*  And you recognize that so much of the suffering
*  associated with the pain
*  was born of the resistance to feeling it.
*  You're kind of bracing against it
*  and all of your thinking about it.
*  You're thinking like, well, why did I do this to myself
*  or should I see an orthopedist
*  or how long is this gonna last?
*  And maybe I herniated a disc.
*  Like all of that self-talk is producing anxiety.
*  And I'm not saying there's never anything
*  to think about there,
*  but either you can do something about it in the moment
*  or you can't.
*  And so much of our suffering in the presence of pain
*  is the result of resisting it, worrying about it.
*  It's just all of the,
*  everything we're doing with our minds,
*  but just feeling it.
*  So when you just feel it,
*  again, it breaks apart into this ever-shifting collection
*  of different sensations.
*  And it's not one thing and it never stays the same.
*  And so two things happen there.
*  One is there can be a tremendous amount of relief
*  that happens there where you can achieve a level
*  of equanimity even in the presence
*  of really unpleasant physical sensation.
*  And this is true of mental sensation as well.
*  This is true of emotions,
*  the classically negative emotions like anger,
*  depression, or fear.
*  The moment you become willing to just feel them
*  in all of their punctate and changeable qualities,
*  they cease to be what they were a moment ago.
*  They're just, and when you're talking about emotional states,
*  they cease to map back onto you and your self-concept
*  as meaningful in the same way.
*  So that suddenly the anxiety you feel,
*  let's say before going out on stage to give a talk,
*  a moment ago, it had psychological meaning.
*  It felt like, okay, I'm anxious.
*  How do I get rid of this?
*  Why am I this sort of person?
*  Should I have taken a beta blocker?
*  This is the conversation you're having with yourself.
*  The moment you just become willing to feel it
*  as the pure energy of the physiology of cortisol release,
*  it ceases to have any meaning.
*  It just ceases to be a problem in that moment
*  because it no more maps onto the kind of person you are
*  than a feeling of indigestion or a pain in your knee
*  maps onto the kind of person you are.
*  It's just sensation.
*  Anyway, but back to the main point here,
*  which is that if you train your attention in this way
*  to notice the particularities of sensory experience
*  and emotional experience,
*  you're looking for the atoms of experience.
*  You get better and better at that and certain things happen.
*  But one thing that I really do think happens
*  is there's a kind of frame rate change in the data stream
*  where you're just noticing much, much more.
*  All of that is a very interesting way of training.
*  It's not what I tend to recommend now.
*  It's a great preliminary practice for what I do recommend
*  because it really teaches you the difference
*  between being lost in thought and not.
*  It really teaches you what mindfulness is.
*  But it tends to be done by 99.9% of people
*  in a dualistic way, which again, you're set up to think,
*  okay, I'm over here as the locus of attention
*  and I'm continually getting distracted by thought.
*  And the project is to not do that anymore
*  and actually pay attention to the breath and sounds
*  and sensations.
*  And every time I get lost in thought,
*  I'm going to go back to here.
*  But this whole dance of I'm lost in thought,
*  now I'm strategically directing my attention
*  again, all of this seems to ramify this sense of self,
*  the sense of there's one to be doing this.
*  There's somebody holding the spotlight of attention
*  and getting better at coming back
*  to the object of meditation.
*  Again, it's inevitable that 99.9% of people
*  are going to start there and stay there
*  for some considerable period of time.
*  But the thing I like to do when I talk about all of this
*  is undercut the false assumptions
*  that are anchoring all of that as early as possible.
*  Because where I think you want to be
*  is recognizing that there is no place
*  from which to aim attention.
*  This whole dualistic setup of subject and object
*  is the thing that is already not there.
*  And it's not that it's there
*  and you meditated out of existence successfully.
*  It's really not there.
*  And if you learn how to look at it,
*  and if you learn how to look for it,
*  you can see that it's not there and feel that it's not there.
*  And it no longer seems to be there.
*  It's like it's not, and it becomes again,
*  like a bistable percept where you looked at it long enough
*  and you thought, okay, now I see the vase and the face
*  and I can't unsee it.
*  And every time I look, it's there again.
*  And so yeah, that means that,
*  so to come back to the example you gave
*  with your colleague at Stanford,
*  whose book I know I have, I haven't read it.
*  He wrote a book, Projections, right?
*  Dasarathya.
*  So it's on my stack to read.
*  But it's the opposite, what I'm recommending
*  is essentially the opposite end of the continuum
*  of the sort of internal exercise he was doing.
*  So rather than, so he's doing something
*  very deliberate and controlled,
*  and he is deliberately thinking in complete sentences
*  and kind of commandeering the machinery
*  of thought and attention in a way that I would imagine,
*  I mean, I'd be interested to talk to him about it,
*  but I would imagine he really feels like he's doing that.
*  And there's a problem.
*  He's an engineer, as you describe it in this way,
*  it reminds me, he's a physician,
*  but he's also an engineer.
*  So it's really about taking the raw materials of thought
*  and engineering something structured from it.
*  I think, I haven't been in Carl's mind.
*  Yeah, but if we got him talking on that,
*  I'm sure we would get a sense of what it is.
*  We'll do that conversation at some point.
*  But it's the exact opposite of what you're describing.
*  The exact opposite would be to recognize that
*  the sense of control is a total illusion, right?
*  Because you don't know what you're going to think next,
*  and even he, in the most laborious way,
*  I mean, he could just get as muscular as he wants with it,
*  he still doesn't know what he's going to think next,
*  because thoughts simply arise.
*  You can run this experiment for yourself,
*  and this connects up to the topic of free will,
*  which we might wanna touch,
*  but just think of any category of thing.
*  If I asked you to think of the names of cities
*  or friends you have or of famous people
*  you can remember exist or think of nouns or anything,
*  and just watch what comes percolating
*  into consciousness, right?
*  Now, there are things you can't think of,
*  or there are things you don't know the name of.
*  There are languages you don't speak.
*  There are famous people you've never seen
*  or never heard of, right?
*  So you have no control over that part.
*  Those names and faces are not going to suddenly
*  come streaming into consciousness.
*  But of the totality of facts and figures and faces
*  and names that you do know, right?
*  Only some will come vying for inclusion, right?
*  And there's a sort of, we could make guess,
*  and we know something about the neurology of this,
*  but depending on what channel you're waiting for thoughts in,
*  I mean, it's gonna be different if it's visual or semantic
*  or episodic memory.
*  I mean, all of these things are different,
*  but wherever you kind of point your inner gaze of attention
*  and wait for the next face or name,
*  certain things are gonna come
*  and certain things aren't going to come.
*  And how you land on one, right?
*  There'll be this process, if you're paying attention,
*  you might think, let's say we go with names of cities, right?
*  So you'll think of Paris, you'll think of London,
*  you'll think of Rome, you'll think of Sedona,
*  you'll think, so these names will come.
*  And if I ask you to just say one, right?
*  So just think.
*  Minneapolis is what came to mind.
*  For me, it was very straightforward.
*  It was Minneapolis, the famous person was Joe Strummer,
*  and they just, like, I can give you reasons
*  why I think those came to mind, recent conversations.
*  Okay, so we know a fair bit about much of this.
*  So one, we know that your reasons,
*  obviously could be right or wrong.
*  They're very likely to be wrong
*  because we have this sort of
*  confabulatory storytelling mechanism,
*  even in an intact brain, where we just,
*  we seem to never lack for the reasons
*  why something came to mind.
*  And we know we can manipulate people
*  in ways that prove that people are just reliably wrong
*  and confident, you know, confidently so,
*  about the reasons why they thought of things or did things.
*  But leaving that aside,
*  even if you're completely accurate, right?
*  There are people's names who you know,
*  and cities' names that you know,
*  that inexplicably just didn't come to mind.
*  And if we ran this experiment again and again and again,
*  they wouldn't come to mind if your brain
*  was in precisely the state it was in a moment ago.
*  If we could return your brain
*  to the state it was in a moment ago,
*  correcting for all the deterministic changes
*  and all the random changes that would have to
*  be corrected for it, just to get all the synapses
*  and the synaptic weights and everything in the state
*  it was in to produce Joe Strummer in Minneapolis, right?
*  You're going to, if we rewind that movie,
*  that part of the movie of your life,
*  you're going to say Joe Strummer in Minneapolis
*  a trillion times in a row, right?
*  So this is why, in my view,
*  the notion of free will makes absolutely no sense, right?
*  And you can add as much randomness to that process
*  as you want, it still doesn't get you
*  the freedom people think they have.
*  There's another conversation to have about,
*  you know, why none of that matters
*  and why things only get better
*  once you admit to yourself that free will is an illusion.
*  And yes, you can get in shape and you can die it
*  and you can do all the things you want to do
*  and you don't have to think about free will.
*  But from a contemplative, meditative point of view,
*  the thing to notice is that everything is just springing
*  into view, right?
*  You're like, there's no place from which you are authoring
*  your next thought because you would have to think it
*  before you think it, right?
*  Like, there is just this fundamental mystery at our backs
*  that is disgorging everything that we experience.
*  What if I'm speaking, so if I'm talking about something
*  and I have some command of that information,
*  I can often sense what I'm going to say next
*  and then find myself saying it.
*  Hopefully that's what you're saying, not something else.
*  I certainly said things I didn't intend to say
*  or never thought I would say in life,
*  but when engaged in speech or action,
*  it at least gives us the illusion, I think,
*  that we somehow have more command over our thoughts.
*  Yeah, well, you have a script.
*  I mean, there are things you know a lot about
*  and you've talked about them a lot
*  and you know you have the things you want to say
*  about those things and the things you don't want to say
*  or you wouldn't want to say.
*  And you know it still is a bit of a high wire act
*  because you can misspeak or you can fail
*  to get to the end of a sentence in a grammatically correct way.
*  And again, all of this, subjectively,
*  this whole process is mysterious to you.
*  You don't know how you follow the rules of English grammar.
*  Like, your tongue is doing it somehow
*  and when it fails, it fails and you're just as surprised
*  as the next guy that it failed.
*  And you mispronounce a word and, okay,
*  I don't know what happened there,
*  but if it keeps happening, I'm gonna worry I had a stroke
*  and if it stops, I'm not gonna worry about it.
*  So it's still mysterious even when you're doing it
*  in a very rote, deliberative, and repetitive way.
*  But when you're talking about something
*  you've talked about a lot
*  and you sort of know where you're gonna go, right?
*  And this is, you know, we have many conversations like this.
*  It is somewhat analogous to like a golf swing
*  where it's like you know how you want to do it.
*  There's gonna be all kinds of errors
*  that are gonna creep into your execution of it in real time.
*  But there's like, you basically have a pattern
*  and so you have certain linguistic patterns
*  which you're following.
*  Again, none of this is a proof of free will,
*  but I will grant you that phenomenologically
*  it feels different than just waiting
*  for the next thought to come.
*  But my point is that even if you're,
*  I mean you can trim it down to the simplest possible thing.
*  I'm like you take two things you like to drink, right?
*  You like coffee and you like tea
*  and you're deciding which to have, right?
*  Both are on offer.
*  You've got two cups in front of you
*  and the question is, you know, which, you know,
*  or here I've got water and I've got coffee,
*  which am I gonna drink next?
*  It's incredibly, it's the simplest possible decision.
*  And no matter how long I make this decision process,
*  I could literally sit for an hour
*  trying to figure out which to reach for next.
*  And I could have my reasons why
*  and I could have all my self-talk.
*  There's going to be a final change in me
*  that's gonna be the proximate cause
*  of me deciding one over the other.
*  And that no matter how laborious I can make it seem
*  in terms of my reasoning about it,
*  it is gonna be fundamentally mysterious
*  as to why I went with one rather than the other, right?
*  Whatever story I have, because it's like,
*  it's still gonna be, you know,
*  it's still gonna be as mysterious
*  as you thinking of Joe Strummer when you absolutely,
*  like you know of the existence of Marilyn Monroe
*  just as much and yet she simply didn't occur to you, right?
*  It's like, it's fundamentally mysterious.
*  Like there are people who are even more famous
*  than Joe Strummer to you, right?
*  Who, I mean, I'm sure you, you know,
*  he may be somebody who you have thought a lot about,
*  but there are people who, like if we could just inventory,
*  you know, your conscious life going back the last 10 years,
*  there are people who you've thought about
*  more than Joe Strummer, yet they didn't appear, right?
*  So, and that is mysterious, right?
*  And they could have, but they didn't.
*  And so, and what I'm saying is that this mystery
*  never gets banished in our experience,
*  whatever stories we have to tell about it.
*  Because if the story is, oh, well,
*  I went for the water because I, you know,
*  I think I've been drinking too much coffee.
*  You know, I listened to Andrew Huberman's podcast
*  and he was talking about caffeine and I think I probably.
*  It's good for us, but you don't want to overdo it.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Okay, so let's say that is actually the causal chain.
*  Like I listened to your podcast,
*  you said something about caffeine,
*  now I'm self-conscious about my coffee intake, right?
*  But that's just adding a couple of links to the chain.
*  There's still this fundamental mystery of,
*  well, why did I find that persuasive?
*  And why did I find it persuasive now
*  and not five minutes ago when I was drinking the coffee,
*  right, like why did I just remember it now?
*  Or why was it effective now?
*  Like you only have, your experience in every moment
*  is precisely what it is and not one bit more.
*  Like, and this subsumes even moments of real resolve
*  and effort and, you know, picking yourself up
*  by your bootstraps and changing everything.
*  It's like you're on a diet and you're tempted to eat chocolate
*  and you think you're about to reach,
*  you say, no, I'm not breaking this diet.
*  This diet is actually gonna stick, right?
*  Okay, why did that arise in that moment
*  and not at this analogous moment on your last diet, right?
*  And why did it arise now to precisely the degree that it did?
*  Why will it be as effective as it will be
*  and have the half-life that it will have
*  and not, you know, 10% more or less?
*  Like all of those are always mysterious to you.
*  Well, could we give a, as we did before,
*  an evolutionary and a developmental explanation?
*  An evolutionary explanation might be that
*  directed attention and action is metabolically demanding.
*  It would be inefficient or impossible
*  for us to be in constant, you know, deliberate action
*  and with access to all the relevant information
*  as to why we would do anything.
*  So our ideas literally spring to the surface
*  at the last possible moment in order to offset
*  the great metabolic requirements of having ideas
*  that are related to goal-directed action
*  or that goal-directed action is expensive.
*  That's one idea.
*  The other idea would be, and we know this as a fact,
*  which is that initially the brain is fairly crudely wired.
*  That's not true within the neural circuits
*  to control breathing, heart rate, et cetera,
*  but within the neural circuits of sensory perception,
*  thought, et cetera, they're fairly crudely wired.
*  And then across development,
*  there's a progressive pruning back.
*  And also in parallel to that,
*  a strengthening of the connections that underlie
*  directed action and thought.
*  And here I don't mean directed as in free will.
*  I mean, just that I can decide to imagine an apple
*  and imagine that apple, for instance.
*  But your decision-
*  There seems to be some maintenance of the random,
*  fine random wiring in systems.
*  I mean, we've seen this even in worms, in flies,
*  in so-called lower invertebrates and lower vertebrates.
*  And we see this in humans.
*  And it seems to be that there's a lot
*  of background spontaneous activity.
*  I mean, I've sunk electrodes into the brains
*  of humans, macaques, carnivores, and mice.
*  And in every case, most of what you hear is called hash.
*  And it has nothing to do with hashish.
*  It's just shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh,
*  on the audio monitor, which is,
*  hey, you're picking up a bunch of action potentials.
*  As you're listening to a chorus of action potentials.
*  But it's rare to find a neuron that faithfully
*  gah, fires to represent some sensory stimulus in the world.
*  And you can arrange that marriage experimentally
*  so that you can arrive at those strong signal to noise events.
*  But I was always struck by how much noise there is
*  in the system all around, all the time.
*  And people argue, is the noise really noise, et cetera?
*  And is it, you know, there's still a lot of debate
*  about that, but I can imagine that some of the spontaneous
*  nature of thoughts just relates to the fact
*  that there's a lot of background spontaneous activity
*  in the brain.
*  Now, why that is, is a whole other discussion.
*  But if I were to sort of set up two constraints
*  that there's a lot of spontaneous activity,
*  it's gonna generate random thoughts.
*  Thankfully, not much random action,
*  although there's a little bit of random action
*  in our daily lives.
*  And then against that say, well, any deliberate thought
*  or motion is going to be expensive, right?
*  It's a metabolically expensive organ to begin with.
*  And so you just have to, evolution has arrived
*  at a place where spontaneous geysering up of things
*  upon which like deliberate thoughts and action
*  are superimposed is the best arrangement overall
*  for this very metabolically demanding organ.
*  Is that, I mean, what I basically gave was just kind
*  of a biological description of one,
*  just one narrow aspect of it.
*  But can we get comfortable with that?
*  And the reason I say get comfortable is that,
*  you know, I'm here, I admittedly,
*  I'm forcing a little bit of a strip tease towards
*  what I think I and everyone else wants to know,
*  which is how to meditate and why in particular meditation
*  convinces us that something doesn't necessarily
*  have to be eliminated, but that was actually never there.
*  I feel like we're now set up a sort of a,
*  almost like a, you're not contradicting yourself
*  by any means, but in my mind, there's a contradiction.
*  And here's the contradiction.
*  I love this statement that meditation over time
*  or done properly reveals to us that we're actually
*  not trying to make the gap between actor and observer
*  go away, it was actually never there.
*  To me, that's one of the more important statements
*  that I perhaps have ever heard.
*  And it inspires me to go further down this path
*  of meditation because I've never experienced that.
*  Not deliberately and certainly not through meditation.
*  If I ever experienced it, it was transient enough
*  that I, you know, I'm intrigued to experience it more.
*  So on the one hand, you're telling me something
*  was never there and there's a profound experience
*  to be had by anyone that's willing to do the work
*  to arrive at that experience of the loss of that illusion.
*  On the other hand, I'm hearing that there's a profound gap
*  that really does exist, which is that we believe
*  that our thoughts are somehow from us.
*  And indeed they're from in the cranial vault someplace,
*  maybe in the body of it as well,
*  but that we over attribute the degree to which we are that
*  and that is us in a way that's volitional, that we control.
*  And so once I'm hearing that there's something,
*  there's an illusion that we can eliminate.
*  And on the other hand, I'm hearing that there's an illusion
*  that we can't eliminate and maybe these are unrelated
*  and I'm bridging them in an unimportant way
*  that seems only important to me,
*  but somehow I can't resolve these two.
*  And maybe the thing to do then is can we separate them
*  in terms of a practice to witness them
*  that would allow us to resolve them separately?
*  Right, so I think I'm hearing the problem.
*  There's this, well, let me kind of bracket
*  the whole free will discussion
*  because it really is the flip side of this coin
*  that the obverse of which is the illusion of the self.
*  So at least I might be on the right track,
*  they are the opposite sides of a coin.
*  Okay, great.
*  To me they seem very different in essence.
*  No, because what I'm calling the sense of self
*  and what I think most people feel
*  as their core sense of self is this feeling of,
*  I mean, it's the feeling of being the locus of attention,
*  but it's also the feeling of being the locus of agency.
*  I can do the next thing.
*  I, like, who's doing this?
*  Who's reaching for the cup?
*  I am, right?
*  I intended this and now I'm doing the thing.
*  And my conscious intention is the proximate cause
*  of my reaching, right?
*  So I'm the author of my thoughts and actions essentially
*  and my specific uses of attention, right?
*  So I can pay attention to the breath,
*  I get lost in thought, I come back to the breath,
*  but on some level the thoughts themselves
*  are more of my doing something
*  with almost an authorial intent, right?
*  Like I'm thinking, what the hell is this guy talking about?
*  I know I'm thinking, I know,
*  who's thinking these thoughts?
*  I am, right?
*  The person who really doesn't get what I'm saying
*  is thinking something like that, right?
*  It's like, what the fuck is this guy talking about?
*  I know I'm here, I'm a self, I'm a body, I'm a mind,
*  I can reach for things, these intentional actions
*  are different from things that happen to me, right?
*  A voluntary action is different from an involuntary one,
*  you know, so having a tremor is different
*  from consciously deciding to pick up a glass, right?
*  So obviously everything I'm saying about meditation
*  and the self and free will in order to be a sane picture
*  of a human mind and of reality
*  has to conserve the data of experience such that,
*  yes, I can acknowledge the difference between a tremor
*  and a deliberative, you know, voluntary motor action.
*  And, you know, and the things you do volitionally
*  are different, not just psychologically and behaviorally,
*  but they just have different implications for it,
*  like in a court of law, you know,
*  you accidentally hit someone with your car
*  or you did it on purpose,
*  that's still a distinction that matters, right?
*  Importantly, it tells us a lot about the global properties
*  of your mind such that, you know,
*  we have a sense of what you're likely to do in the future.
*  If you're someone who likes running over people
*  with your car, you know, you're a psychopath
*  who we need to worry about,
*  if you're someone who did it by accident,
*  well then, you know, you may be culpable
*  for the level of negligence that allowed that to happen,
*  but you're a very different person
*  and we treat you differently and we're wise to.
*  So anyway, let's bracket all of that.
*  There's this, I mean, there's some fundamental,
*  there's some false assumptions about
*  the underlying logic of this process,
*  which I think it's worth addressing,
*  and it is actually, there's a kind of found object
*  in the news that I talk about.
*  At one point, I forget where it is in the Waking Up app,
*  but there's a story that I stumbled on on the internet,
*  I think it's about 12 or 13 years old,
*  of a tourist bus in, I think it was Norway,
*  it was somewhere in Northern Europe,
*  and it had about 30 people on it,
*  and one person was described as an Asian woman,
*  they went to a rest stop and everyone got off the bus,
*  and they, you know, shopped and had lunch,
*  and this Asian woman changed her clothing,
*  for whatever reason, and they all got back on the bus.
*  I think the relevance of it being an Asian woman is,
*  there were language barriers
*  that explained what later happened.
*  So everyone gets back on the bus,
*  the Asian woman has changed her clothing,
*  and the bus is about to leave,
*  but then someone notices, hey, there was an Asian woman
*  who got off the bus who hasn't come back yet,
*  and they tell the driver this,
*  and this poses a problem,
*  so now everyone's waiting for this person to return,
*  but in fact, everyone was on the bus,
*  that this woman had just changed her clothing,
*  and was not recognized by her fellow travelers.
*  So everyone gets concerned,
*  as this tourist doesn't show up,
*  and they start looking for her, right,
*  and they can't find her,
*  and so a search party is formed,
*  and the Asian woman, because of whatever language barrier,
*  heard that there was a missing tourist,
*  so she joins the search party,
*  which in fact is looking for her, right,
*  and this goes on into the night,
*  and they're readying helicopters for a dawn patrol
*  to find the missing tourist.
*  Now at some point along the way,
*  I think it was at like three in the morning,
*  this tourist realizes that she is the object
*  of this search, right,
*  and obviously the whole thing unravels.
*  She confesses that she changed her clothes,
*  and the problem is solved,
*  but the problem is not solved by the logic
*  that the seeker is expected, right,
*  so it's like, it's not true to say
*  that the missing tourist was found
*  in the way that was expected, right,
*  because the missing tourist was never lost.
*  The missing tourist was part of the search party, right,
*  and so when you think about it from her point of view,
*  like what happened, she's part of the search party.
*  She's looking for the missing tourist,
*  not knowing that she in fact is the missing tourist,
*  so what happens at the moment she realizes
*  that everyone's looking for her, right,
*  like what is, the search isn't consummated
*  in the way that is implied by the logic
*  of everyone's use of attention,
*  and yet the problem evaporates,
*  and there's something deeply analogous
*  about the structure of that and the meditative journey.
*  Precisely in, again, not talking about all the changes
*  and the possible changes in the contents of consciousness
*  that could be good, which again,
*  they come along for the ride anyway
*  when you do the thing I'm talking about.
*  It's on this point of looking for the self
*  and not finding it, and there is this sense that,
*  okay, the self is here and it's a problem.
*  It is the string upon which all of my conscious states,
*  mostly unhappy ones, are strung, right?
*  It's the thing that is at the center of my anxiety.
*  It's the thing that I don't feel good about.
*  It's the thing that when criticized, I sort of let implode.
*  It's the center of my problem,
*  and now I'm trying to feel better,
*  and meditation has been handed to me
*  as a possible remedy for my situation,
*  and it's billed as a remedy, and in fact,
*  it's, I'm hearing from this guy that this is the thing
*  that is gonna cause me to realize
*  that myself isn't where, or as I thought it was.
*  So now I'm gonna look, right?
*  And so, again, the sense is,
*  I start out far away from the goal here.
*  I start out with a problem.
*  I'm now meditating on the evidence of my unenlightenment.
*  I can feel my problem.
*  I feel that I'm distracted and distractible,
*  and I feel this sort of cramp at the center of my life.
*  It's me, and I'm not as happy as I wanna be.
*  I'm not as confident as I wanna be.
*  I'm more distractible than I wanna be,
*  and now I'm paying attention to the breath, right?
*  This is what the search party feels like.
*  This is what the confused tourist feels like
*  in her own search party, and she's looking
*  for the missing person, and so the angle of,
*  the inclination of all of this is,
*  and the logic of it is all wrong, understandably so,
*  given how we all get into this situation,
*  but it's useful to continually try to undercut it
*  and recognize that the thing that's being looked for
*  is actually right on the surface,
*  which is, there is no one looking.
*  There is no place from which,
*  if you're paying attention to the breath, or to sounds,
*  or noticing the next thought arise,
*  this sense that you are over here doing that thing
*  is actually what it's like to be thinking
*  and not knowing that you're thinking.
*  There's a thought, there's an undercurrent of thought
*  that's going uninspected in that moment,
*  and so there is just a, there's a continually looking
*  for the mind, a looking for the center of experience,
*  a looking for the one who is looking, which, again,
*  which is the kind of the orienting practice here,
*  and there's a lot more I say about this, obviously,
*  over at Waking Up, but it's the experiment
*  you have to perform in order to get ready to recognize
*  that this whole, the search party was formed in error,
*  essentially, and the problem that you're trying to solve
*  with this practice does evaporate in a similar way,
*  which is like, you don't actually get there
*  in the way that you're hoping for, right?
*  It's like you drop out the bottom of this thing
*  in an unexpected way.
*  It's not, there's actually another kind of a similar parable
*  or anecdote that I don't remember if it's Zen or Sufi,
*  or I'm sure it's been re-appropriated
*  in many different ways, but, or by many different traditions,
*  but there's this, the case of somebody who's lost in a town
*  and they're asking for directions,
*  you could put this in Manhattan,
*  you could, let's say you're wandering Manhattan
*  and you're a tourist, you don't know where anything is,
*  and you stop and ask someone, where is Central Park,
*  and the person thinks for a second and they say,
*  oh yeah, unfortunately you can't get
*  to Central Park from here, right?
*  Now that is a very strange, I mean,
*  you think about that for a second, you realize,
*  okay, that's an absurd claim, there is no place
*  that you can't get to from the place you're starting
*  on earth, right?
*  That's a failure to describe the physical relationships
*  between anything in the world.
*  Yeah, that's just not the world we live in, right?
*  So, but it's a funny thing, but on some level,
*  that is true of meditation, it's like,
*  you can't get there from here, like, but the sense of you,
*  the sense of you as subject isn't brought along
*  to this thing you're looking for, right?
*  Like you're like, you're, you know, it's almost like,
*  it's almost like you're making a fist
*  and you're trying to get to an open hand.
*  The fist doesn't get to take that journey as a fist, right?
*  Like you don't, the fist doesn't go along for the ride,
*  the fist comes apart, right?
*  And on some level, our subjectivity is a kind of
*  an intentional fist, you know, it is a contraction of energy.
*  Again, it's so much bound up in thought for most of us
*  most of the time, that is, and when properly inspected,
*  there's just this, you know, evaporation
*  of the starting point, but there's not this fulfillment
*  of I'm gonna get this fist, it's gonna just gonna,
*  if I, you know, if life gets good enough,
*  if I get concentrated enough, focused enough, you know,
*  if I austere enough, if I renounce enough,
*  if I desire less, if I, you know, enough,
*  with enough good intentions, this fist is gonna move
*  into some sort of sublime condition, right?
*  That's not the logic of the process.
*  I really appreciate these models and analogies
*  for conscious experience, both as most people experience them
*  and harbor them and it's as a way to frame what's possible
*  through a proper meditation practice.
*  I do wanna talk about what a proper meditation practice
*  looks like a bit, but at some point,
*  I do want to raise a model of maybe even just
*  perceptual awareness to see if it survives the filters
*  that you've provided, but first, just even if briefly
*  and then we could return to it, you know,
*  what does this meditation practice
*  or set of practices look like?
*  Obviously, the app is a wonderful tool.
*  I've started using it, as I mentioned in the beginning,
*  my father's been using it for a while
*  and many people have derived great benefit from it.
*  But if we were to break it down meditation
*  into some basic component parts,
*  as we have broken down normal perceptual experience
*  in some of its component parts,
*  I can just throw out some things that I associate
*  with meditation and maybe you can elaborate
*  on how these may or may not be applied.
*  For instance, there is almost always a ceasing
*  of robust motor movement.
*  I know they're walking meditations and so forth,
*  but it seems like sitting or lying down
*  and perhaps not always, but often limiting
*  our visual perception, closing the eyes,
*  directing a mind's eye someplace.
*  Is there a dedicated effort toward generating imagery?
*  What are the component parts?
*  And where I'm really going with this is
*  why would those component parts eventually allow
*  for this disillusion of the fist or the realization
*  that there is no distinction between actor and observer
*  and so on.
*  Yeah, well, to answer that second question first,
*  ultimately meditation is not a practice
*  that you're adding to your life.
*  It's not doing more of anything.
*  It's actually ceasing to do something.
*  It's ultimately non-distraction.
*  I mean, ultimately you're recognizing
*  what consciousness is like
*  when you're no longer distracted
*  by the automatic arising of thought.
*  It's not that thoughts don't arise.
*  It's not that you can't use them.
*  It's not that you've become irrational or unintelligent.
*  I mean, all of that, you still have all of your tools,
*  but everything is in plain view.
*  I mean, there's an analogy in Tibetan Buddhism,
*  which I love, which is kind of in the final stage
*  of meditation, thoughts are like thieves
*  entering an empty house.
*  There's nothing for them to steal.
*  So in the usual case,
*  thoughts are, there really is something in jeopardy.
*  Every time a thought comes, I'm not meditating anymore.
*  And not only that, I feel terrible
*  because of what I'm thinking about most of the time.
*  And so it's totally understandable
*  that thoughts seem like a problem in the beginning.
*  And for certain types of meditation,
*  they are explicitly thought of as a problem
*  because you're trying to focus on one thing
*  to the exclusion of everything else, including thought.
*  And that is what I called concentration practice earlier.
*  And that is a, you know,
*  that's a training that can be good to do.
*  It becomes a tool that you can use
*  for other kinds of insight,
*  but it's a very specific and kind of brittle skill
*  in the end.
*  I mean, it's a skill,
*  just like I'm gonna pay attention to one thing
*  and I'm gonna do that so well
*  that everything else is gonna fade out.
*  And it's somewhat analogous
*  to what you described in the visual system.
*  If you have laser focus to one fixation point,
*  everything else in your visual field begins to fade out.
*  But meditatively, if you have a laser focus on any one thing,
*  whether it's the breath or a candle flame or whatever it is,
*  not only does, I mean, let's use the breath for a second
*  because your eyes can be closed.
*  I mean, you can lose all sense of everything.
*  I mean, you can lose all sense of hearing
*  and your physical body can disappear.
*  I mean, like literally can become incredibly subtle
*  and vast and drug-like.
*  And many people approach meditation thinking,
*  kind of climbing the ladder of those changes
*  into subtlety and vastness.
*  That's the whole game, right?
*  And it can be a deeply rewarding game to play.
*  And it also does come with all kinds of ancillary benefits.
*  I mean, all the focus and the calm
*  and the kind of smoothness of emotional states.
*  I mean, all of that comes with greater concentration
*  and it can be quite wonderful.
*  But again, at best, that's a tool to aim in the direction
*  that I'm talking about now with respect to meditation,
*  which relates to more what I would call
*  mindfulness generically
*  and ultimately kind of non-dual mindfulness.
*  So mindfulness generically and for most people,
*  certainly in the beginning, dualistically is
*  just the practice of paying careful attention
*  to whatever is arising on its own, right?
*  Now, in the beginning, it's natural to take
*  a single object like the breath as a starting point.
*  It's kind of an anchor.
*  But very, very quickly, over the course of even
*  your first week of doing this, teachers and various sources
*  of information will recommend that once you get some facility,
*  once you know the difference between being lost in thought
*  and actually paying attention to the breath,
*  well then you can open it up to everything.
*  You can open up to sounds and other sensations in the body
*  and moods and emotions and even ultimately thoughts themselves
*  and so very quickly you can recognize that thoughts
*  are not intrinsically the enemy to this practice.
*  They are also just spontaneous appearances in consciousness
*  that can be observed.
*  But for some considerable period of time,
*  people will feel that there is a place from which
*  that observation is happening, right?
*  There's just, you know, I'm now the one who's being mindful
*  of how you're feeling and how ever attenuated
*  that sense of self can be.
*  I mean, again, it can get very expansive.
*  I mean, you can lose, as you get anything,
*  just a monocle of concentration, it becomes very drug-like
*  and you get, the boundaries of your body dissolve
*  and your feeling of having a body can disappear
*  and if your eyes are closed, your visual field,
*  I mean, most people, when they close their eyes initially,
*  they just forget about their visual field,
*  but if you close your eyes right now,
*  you notice your visual field is fully present
*  and we call it dark, but it's not quite dark.
*  There is this sort of scintillating field of color
*  and shadow that's there in the darkness of your closed eyes
*  and that can become a sky-like domain of kind of vast
*  visual expression that opens up as you get more concentrated
*  with your eyes closed, right?
*  So you can very much be aware of seeing
*  with your eyes closed in meditative practice.
*  But from the point of view of mindfulness,
*  the logic is not to care about any of the interesting changes
*  and experience that come as a result of practicing
*  in this way because the underlying goal is to be more
*  and more equanimous with changes, so not to grasp
*  at what's pleasant or interesting and not to push
*  what's unpleasant or boring or otherwise non-engaging away.
*  What you want is just a kind of a sky-like mind
*  that just allows everything to appear
*  and you're not clinging to anything or reacting to anything.
*  Could I ask you what your thoughts are about the differences
*  between nouns, adjectives, and verbs in the context
*  of what we're talking about and you're describing?
*  And the reason I bring this up is that, as you know,
*  and I know everything in biology is a process,
*  we would never ever say, oh, the perception of that red line
*  on a painting is a noun, right?
*  I mean, it's an event in the visual system.
*  You're abstracting some understanding about that thing
*  in the outside world.
*  And I think it's very useful in thinking about the brain.
*  And people will notice I notice, excuse me,
*  actively avoid the use of the word mind because I figure,
*  especially with you sitting across from me,
*  that I'll step in it if I do.
*  But the brain generates a series of perceptions
*  or what have you by through processes, not nouns.
*  And so when thinking about biology,
*  I think of development as an arc of processes.
*  Aging is an arc of, perception is an arc of processes.
*  They just exist on different timescales.
*  And so a little bit of what I'm hearing
*  is that inside of an effective meditation practice,
*  there's a little bit of a, certainly non-judgment,
*  but discarding of the noun and the adjective
*  modes of language, like red apple.
*  Okay, it's a red apple, but then you sort of need
*  to eliminate some other adjectives about it.
*  It's a rotten apple, it's a ripe apple.
*  And instead view the appearance and disappearance
*  of that apple as a, it's just a thing, a process,
*  as opposed to an event.
*  And now events could, we could really get
*  into the language aspect of it.
*  That just reveals how diminished language is
*  to describe the workings of the brain at some level.
*  I don't know if any of this resonates,
*  but it seems to me the goal, or one of the goals,
*  is to start to understand the algorithm
*  that is the fleeting nature of perception,
*  but to not focus on any one single perception.
*  And then to not even focus on one single algorithm,
*  but to, at some level, there's a,
*  what is revealed to the meditator over time
*  is some sort of macroscopic principle
*  about the way perceptions work at a deeper level, right?
*  That there's sort of a deeper principle there
*  that sits below our, certainly our normal everyday awareness,
*  but that in paying attention to the mechanics
*  of all this stuff and not judging those mechanics,
*  not naming those mechanics, or just naming them
*  and let them pass by, that there's some action function,
*  some verb is revealed.
*  And that maybe that verb, maybe the word to describe
*  that verb is mindfulness.
*  Maybe mindfulness is really just a verb to describe that.
*  I don't know.
*  Is there anything here, or am I creating,
*  I don't know if I'm creating just like useless straw,
*  or if there's actually a seed here of something real.
*  But to me, anytime I wanna understand something in biology
*  or psychology, I try and broaden the time domain
*  and think in terms of verbs, not nouns or adjectives.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  No, that's very useful.
*  And that's somewhat adjacent to this distinction I'm making
*  between dualistic and non-dualistic ways
*  of experiencing the world.
*  So even dualistically, everything is still a process,
*  and we're misled by the reification
*  that noun talk gives us.
*  And this applies not just to something like mindfulness,
*  but even to something like the self.
*  So the sense of self is also a process.
*  I mean, it's a verb.
*  So we're selfing more than we are selves.
*  And there are even appropriate uses of the term self
*  that don't go away even when you recognize
*  that the core subject self is an illusion.
*  There are states of self, right,
*  where you can recognize in your life
*  that you inhabit very different modes of being,
*  depending on the context.
*  So like there are moments where you,
*  just by walking into a certain building,
*  you suddenly transition into a different state of self.
*  Like suddenly you pass through a door,
*  and now you are a customer in a store, right?
*  So we know what that customer feeling is.
*  Like you're now the person who's getting the attention.
*  It's a very kind of formalized type of attention
*  from the person who's running the store,
*  and, you know, or a restaurant,
*  you're a customer in a restaurant, right?
*  That's a, I just remembered something that's kind of funny.
*  It was born of a mismatch of this.
*  I'll come back to that in a second.
*  But so there are, so we go through,
*  you can be a student in the presence of a teacher,
*  you can be a parent in the presence of a son or a daughter,
*  you can be a spouse in the presence of your spouse,
*  and all of those shadings of,
*  like the change in context really does,
*  usher in some fundamental psychological changes
*  in just the states of consciousness
*  that are available to you.
*  And some of this is really,
*  I mean, I'm sure we could understand a lot about this,
*  you know, personally and, you know, generically,
*  but it is pretty mysterious.
*  I mean, like, I mean, there are people who I know,
*  who I, you know, I'm with them in a certain way,
*  and like, based on something I'm getting off of them,
*  like, I can't be that, I'm effortlessly one way with them,
*  and there's no way I could be that way with somebody else.
*  Right, like, it's just, I don't know if it's pheromones
*  or their facial, it's just the way they are,
*  their facial expression,
*  but I mean, there are people with whom
*  I'm really kind of effortlessly funny,
*  and there are people with whom, you know,
*  I couldn't even, it would never occur to me to be funny
*  no matter what happened, you know,
*  and I have, like, longstanding relationships
*  with these people, you know, so like, it's just very,
*  you know, all of that's very mysterious,
*  but anyway, the difference there is not in this core sense
*  of subject in relationship to all the objects,
*  it's in kind of the states of self,
*  and all of that is just very verby, right,
*  like, all this pattern of changes,
*  it's a pattern of what's available
*  and what's not available, the capacities that are,
*  that come online or not in those various contexts,
*  but no, the memory I just had,
*  which I hadn't had in a long time,
*  but it was one of these moments where I realized
*  the power of these shifts in context for states of self,
*  so I once, I was a young man,
*  I think I was probably 22 or so,
*  and single, and like, just like trying to figure out
*  how do you meet women, and like,
*  how does one get confident to do this well,
*  and I walked into a restaurant,
*  and a kind of a woman was walking toward me,
*  toward the front door of the restaurant,
*  but she was walking toward me in a way
*  where I just, by default, assumed
*  she was the hostess in the restaurant,
*  but she wasn't the hostess, she was just a, you know,
*  someone who had just eaten there, I guess,
*  so I walked through, and she comes out,
*  and so there's a fundamental misunderstanding in me
*  that's set up by literally just this change in architecture,
*  and so I just said hi to her in a way that I would,
*  I presumably I would say hi to any hostess
*  who was coming up to ask me where I wanted to sit,
*  but what had actually happened is I had said hi
*  to a total stranger in a way that I tended, at that point,
*  never to say hi to total strangers,
*  because I was shy, and you know, just like,
*  but apparently I gave her like a 10,000 watt high
*  of like all of the confidence you would have
*  if you were that sort of person,
*  and it just ushered in a complete, like, you know,
*  so I went to my table, and this woman came back
*  into the restaurant and gave me her phone number, right,
*  which was something that was just
*  completely foreign experience to me, you know,
*  and it was based completely on my misunderstanding
*  of the situation I was in, right, and so anyway.
*  Among the misunderstanding,
*  among the misunderstandings that one can have
*  and then action engage in life, I would say that,
*  that was a somewhat adaptive one.
*  Yeah, yeah, but then you realize that, okay,
*  but then there are certain people who recognize
*  this machinery to whatever degree,
*  or have kind of natural aptitudes
*  for bringing certain things online or not,
*  such that, okay, they can make these,
*  they can consciously make these states of self,
*  you know, this level of gregariousness, say,
*  available to them in different,
*  in the circumstances where it's actually useful to them.
*  So like, if you're single and you wanna meet people,
*  well, it's actually very helpful to feel confident enough
*  to just go say hi to strangers
*  and ask them how they're doing,
*  and to be, you know, online, you know, in that way,
*  where at that point in my life, in that circumstance,
*  you know, by default, I was gonna ignore this stranger
*  who I was passing by in the doorway of a restaurant,
*  but thinking she was the hostess,
*  I was engaging her, you know, fully.
*  So anyway, you can consciously, again,
*  this does not invoke free will at all, but yes,
*  you can consciously decide to play with these mechanisms
*  such that you can decide what states of self
*  would be more normative to have,
*  you know, given what you want in life,
*  and you can become increasingly, you know,
*  attentive to the ways in which you get played by the world.
*  You know, you're a kind of instrument,
*  your mind is a kind of instrument,
*  your brain is a kind of instrument
*  that is continually getting played
*  by the situations you're in,
*  and you can become more of an intelligent curator
*  of your conscious states and your conscious capacities
*  just by noticing the changes in you.
*  Like, in graduate school, it's something I talk about,
*  I think at some point in waking up,
*  this became very stark for me because I had,
*  you know, I was an old graduate student,
*  I had taken 11 years off at Stanford
*  between my sophomore and junior year, right?
*  So I like, when I went back to school-
*  Talk about a leave of absence.
*  Yeah, no, it was, yeah, yeah.
*  But I mean, so Stanford had this, you know,
*  you might know this, they have this stopout policy
*  where you never really drop out, you just stop out.
*  So you're like, you can always go back,
*  you don't have to write letters saying that you still exist
*  every two years as you do in other schools.
*  So anyway, I showed up after 11 years,
*  and, but, you know, so I was really on a deadline
*  and I felt late for everything,
*  so I'm kind of finishing my degree as quickly as I can
*  as an undergraduate, and then I jump into graduate school
*  and I'm an old graduate student,
*  and I'm, you know, there's a real sense of kind of urgency,
*  like I'm late, I should have done this earlier,
*  I wanna get this stuff done.
*  But then 9-11 happened, and I,
*  just as I had finished my coursework, you know,
*  getting my PhD, and I was just getting into my research,
*  but 9-11 intersected with my life in such a way
*  that I just had to drop everything and write my first book,
*  and I did that, and then I just had to drop everything
*  and write my second book because of the response
*  to the first book, and so essentially I had like four years
*  where I was AWOL doing my PhD,
*  but I still had a toe in the lab,
*  and I was still showing up occasionally,
*  but I was becoming this kind of cautionary tale
*  from the point of view of grad school,
*  but I was also becoming kind of a famous,
*  you know, or semi-famous writer,
*  because my first book had been a New York Times bestseller,
*  and I just, I was, you know,
*  so I was getting some notoriety as a writer,
*  and so I was doing things like, you know,
*  I was giving a TED Talk,
*  but I still hadn't finished graduate school, right?
*  So like it was just, it was, I think that timing's right.
*  Maybe I had just finished graduate school
*  when I gave the TED Talk, but anyway,
*  so I was rowing in two boats, and one boat was sinking,
*  or you know, showing every sign of being damaged,
*  and I was literally like, you know,
*  getting letters from the head of the department saying,
*  you know, we're concerned about you,
*  but on the other hand, I was like becoming a, you know,
*  a quasi-celebrity in that world too, you know,
*  at least in a world that was overlapping,
*  so I was having the experience of like going in,
*  I mean, the moment where this crystallized
*  would form me in a fairly peculiar way was,
*  I had a meeting at like three o'clock with my advisor,
*  who was just, this guy Mark Cohen
*  in the Brain Mapping Center at UCLA,
*  he was a fantastic guy, great advisor,
*  I did not extract as much wisdom from him as I should have,
*  brilliant scientist, and you know, he's,
*  for him, I'm late, right, at least in my head,
*  like he, it's not that he was riding me so hard,
*  but like in my head, I'm very self-conscious
*  about how I'm not living up to his expectations
*  at this point, so I have a meeting with him
*  at like three o'clock, and I'm just kind of wilting,
*  you know, under my, you know, his gaze
*  and my own imagined inner gaze of his,
*  you know, but that, two hours later,
*  I have a meeting with his boss,
*  you know, a dinner meeting with his boss,
*  who wants to meet with me to get advice
*  on launching his book, we have the same publisher,
*  but I'm like the much bigger author at Norton,
*  you know, and he's coming to me for advice,
*  and so I'm ricocheting between two diametrically
*  opposite self-states that are, again,
*  this comes down to architecture, it's literally
*  like the state I was in walking into one building
*  and then leaving and walking into another building
*  on the same campus, and they were completely
*  opposite self-concepts, like in one context,
*  I'm a fuckup, in another context, I'm a celebrity.
*  And you have mastery and virtuosity,
*  and we're developing it very quickly.
*  Yeah, and so, again, this is kind of a stark version
*  of that, but everyone has some version of this
*  just in bouncing between talking to their mom
*  and then talking to their best friend
*  and then talking to a stranger and then,
*  and talking to someone who's very successful,
*  talking to someone who's not very successful,
*  you notice your vulnerability to all of this stuff,
*  and ultimately what you want is a level
*  of psychological integrity that is truly
*  divorcible from that.
*  Now, I'm not saying you're ever gonna get it perfect,
*  you know, there's always gonna be some,
*  I mean, I can't talk about the ultimate fulfillment
*  of this process, like I'm not a Buddha,
*  I'm not saying I've finished the project,
*  but I think there's more and more,
*  as you become sensitive to these changes
*  and you become sensitive to what it's like
*  to actually not be psychologically reactive
*  and not be definable by your own self-concept,
*  your own, I mean, you're not identifying with anything,
*  you're not hanging your hat on anything,
*  you're not thinking about yourself in terms,
*  in the kind of terms that you would export to others
*  and then care about what they think about you, right?
*  Like there's a kind of invulnerability that arises,
*  that's not born of being well-defended,
*  it's born of being evaporated, right?
*  It's like you're no longer keeping score in those ways.
*  Once again, I really appreciate that description
*  because these days I'm really intrigued
*  by something we've known for a long time
*  that you're certainly familiar with
*  is the prefrontal cortex's ability
*  to establish context-dependent rule sets.
*  Stroop task will be a basic example of reading numbers
*  or letters on cards and then switching to having
*  to report the colors that the letters
*  and numbers are written in.
*  It's a basic task, but prefrontal cortex
*  obviously important for setting context-dependent thought
*  and behavior and directed action,
*  but within the context of all these different variations
*  of the self, depending on graduate school or relationship
*  or sitting alone in one's room,
*  yeah, there are different rule sets arise,
*  but in somehow we are able to have a sense,
*  a coherent sense of self that encompasses all of those.
*  Functional people can toggle between them as needed
*  and not overlap them inappropriately,
*  at least not to the extent that it's career failing
*  or life failing, although there are sad examples of that,
*  many of which exist in the Twitter space.
*  I know several colleagues, not directly of mine,
*  but people who through mistakes made with their thumbs
*  where they forgot context or forgot to realize
*  that the context on social media is near infinite,
*  but the context that existed in their head
*  might not be clear in the way that they communicated something
*  and they lost their jobs by saying what were perceived
*  as insensitive things in some cases
*  were in fact offensive, insensitive things,
*  in some cases it's debatable, right?
*  In any case, I think that the image that now comes to mind
*  relates to something you said several times,
*  that it's not about eliminating something,
*  it's about revealing that something
*  was never actually there.
*  And then in terms of sensory experience
*  and these different aspects of the self,
*  I have this image in my mind of,
*  I'm not an experienced scuba diver,
*  but I've done enough of it, you know, worn a wetsuit,
*  you wear a complete wetsuit with the hood
*  and this idea, you know, if you were born into that wetsuit,
*  you might think that, yeah, you nudge up
*  or lean up against a wall and you experience it one way,
*  right, but were you to shed that wetsuit,
*  you go, wow, there's this incredible landscape
*  of somatosensory experience that I had no idea,
*  that goes way beyond levels of sensitivity, right?
*  Now you're talking about fine two-point discrimination
*  and light strokes and this could be positive or negative,
*  pain in other ways too, but what you're describing
*  is essentially that the wetsuit was never really there,
*  but was created through a series of action steps.
*  And I think what we're migrating towards here
*  is for most non-intuitive or non-reflexive action steps
*  that reveal to us that in fact,
*  we're not wearing this wetsuit.
*  Now you raised one topic which I think is analogous
*  to this wetsuit, which is this notion of distraction.
*  That normally distraction is masking
*  what would otherwise be a better experience of life.
*  I can think of distraction
*  as falling into two different bins.
*  One would be the kind of distraction
*  that is internally generated,
*  like the fact that thoughts arise
*  and pull me down different alleyways and avenues
*  of my brain and my thoughts and my experience.
*  And then the other would be,
*  and that would compete with my ability
*  to really focus on something.
*  And then another form of distraction
*  which captures my ability to focus intensely,
*  but has me focusing on the wrong things.
*  And here, I think the judgment of wrong is reasonable
*  to include if for instance,
*  I'm being impulsively yanked to something on social media.
*  I'm being impulsively yanked
*  to someone else's pain and experience
*  and somehow confusing that with my own experience.
*  This isn't empathy, but just being yanked around,
*  my attention as a spotlight is kind of like over here,
*  over there.
*  I'm not feeling as if I'm the one standing
*  behind that spotlight controlling it
*  or I'm not the spotlight just to keep
*  with what we've been building up here.
*  So could you tell us a little bit about distraction
*  and tell me whether or not these two forms
*  are in any way accurate or inaccurate?
*  I'd be happy for them to be inaccurate.
*  And whether or not there are other forms of distraction
*  that we need to be on the lookout for.
*  And again, I think what most people are seeking
*  is what is the way to not just enhance our ability to focus
*  but to shed this wetsuit-like cloak
*  that limits our experience that I'm calling
*  and that you've called distraction?
*  Yeah, I get what this,
*  I mean, distraction is one component of it.
*  The other aspect of it is identification with thought
*  and the feeling of self is bound up in the sense
*  that I'm the thinker, I'm the one attending,
*  I'm the one vulnerable, I'm the inner,
*  kind of the inner homunculus that's vulnerable to experience
*  and it can be gratified by it or not
*  and it's constantly trying to improve it
*  or mitigate negative aspects of it.
*  It's the sense that there's kind of a rider
*  on the horse of consciousness
*  as opposed to just consciousness and its contents.
*  So again, it rides atop this illusion of control
*  et cetera.
*  So to go all the way back to the question you asked about,
*  just what is in it,
*  what do I recommend as a starting point for meditation?
*  Some of your assumptions are in fact true.
*  Yes, I mean, it's,
*  I often recommend in the beginning people close their eyes
*  and you do a sitting practice
*  and that's different from a walking practice.
*  I mean, you can do both,
*  but people tend to start sitting with their eyes closed.
*  But again, ultimately where this is going is,
*  it's not an art of meditation properly recognized
*  is not an artifice that you're adding to your life.
*  It's not even a practice.
*  It is less rather than more.
*  And therefore it is also coincident
*  with potentially every waking moment.
*  There's nothing that you can do with your attention
*  once you know how to meditate
*  that in principle excludes meditation
*  because meditation is just a recognition
*  of an intrinsic character of consciousness in each moment.
*  And all you have in each moment is consciousness
*  and its contents, whatever you're doing.
*  So in the beginning,
*  you'll be very deliberate and precious
*  about deciding to practice meditation
*  and you'll set aside 10 minutes in the morning
*  and you'll do that.
*  And then, and it'll seem very different
*  from the next 10 minutes
*  when you're spilling out onto your to-do list
*  and you're trying to figure out what the day looks like.
*  But ultimately you want to erase this boundary
*  between formal practice and the rest of life
*  such that it's just not remotely findable.
*  And that's achievable.
*  And I think even from the very beginning,
*  you can relax this conceptual distinction
*  between meditation and its antithesis
*  because it's not at the level of anything you're doing.
*  It's at the level of what's happening
*  in your relationship to thought.
*  Like what can you notice?
*  When you know, it's the transition from
*  the bistable percept.
*  You're looking at the image and you see nothing.
*  Let's say the Dalmatian,
*  it's just the spots on the paper
*  and you don't see anything.
*  And then all of a sudden the Dalmatian
*  or the face of Jesus or whatever the image is pops out.
*  And then you see it.
*  It's the transition from nothing to something.
*  The practice becomes the transition
*  from being lost in thought and then waking up.
*  Breaking the spell of thought,
*  identification with thought,
*  is very much like waking up from a dream
*  and having that transition.
*  Like you're having a dream
*  and there's a couple things are true there.
*  It really is a kind of, it's a psychosis
*  that is just not, we don't problematize
*  because you're safely in bed and you're not moving
*  unless you've got some kind of sleep disorder.
*  You're not walking around harming yourself or anybody else.
*  But to be in bed and to not know it
*  and to think you're running along a beach
*  or you're getting tried for murder in a court of law
*  or whatever the thing is
*  that you're completely delusional about,
*  that is psychosis.
*  And so you're fundamentally unaware of your circumstance.
*  And then there are two things can happen there.
*  You can either become lucid within the dream,
*  which is interesting and there's a whole phenomenology
*  of that which can be practiced.
*  But more commonly, you can just wake up from the dream
*  and all of a sudden the problem you thought you had
*  is no longer there.
*  And you have a completely different context
*  for your conscious life.
*  Like now you know you're in bed,
*  you're safely in bed all the while.
*  There really is something analogous
*  when you break this identification with thought, right?
*  You're just, you're having a thought
*  that seems to be some kind of, you know,
*  moral or psychological emergency.
*  And yet you can,
*  the moment you see daylight around it,
*  the moment you see that the mind is larger
*  than this mere appearance, right?
*  Then you have it, suddenly you have a degree of freedom
*  that a moment ago was just unthinkable, right?
*  And you're also, you recognize,
*  you sort of come to in a way,
*  you recognize your circumstance in a way
*  that you weren't a moment ago
*  when you were just talking to yourself,
*  when you were just identical to that conversation.
*  So it's all to say that ultimately meditation,
*  I mean, so again, there's another apparent paradox here.
*  Many people don't know much about meditation.
*  We'll say things like, you know, well, you know,
*  for me running is my meditation,
*  or skiing, or rock climbing, or playing the guitar,
*  something they like to do
*  that gives them an experience of flow.
*  That's what they go to, to feel better.
*  And that's the opposite of all the chaos of their lives
*  or their time on Twitter or whatever it is.
*  In virtually every case,
*  it's not true to say that that is effectively meditation.
*  You're not gonna, by learning to play the guitar,
*  you're not gonna learn what I'm calling meditation.
*  And you're not gonna learn it by cycling
*  or getting, no matter how good you get at any of those things,
*  you're not gonna learn it by doing those things.
*  But paradoxically, I mean, not really,
*  but it can seem like a paradox.
*  Once you know how to meditate,
*  then you can meditate doing all of those things, right?
*  Meditation is totally compatible with playing the guitar,
*  skiing, or doing any ordinary thing you like to do, right?
*  So once you know how to meditate,
*  and again, it's totally natural in the beginning
*  to formalize it and to set aside time each day to do it,
*  because it is a training.
*  I mean, it is something that in the beginning
*  you have to get used to.
*  But once you're getting used to it,
*  then there is no good reason not to be experiencing
*  this thing I'm calling meditation,
*  this insight into the centralistness of consciousness,
*  the non-selfhood of consciousness.
*  You should experience it when you're
*  playing your favorite sport
*  or when you're having a conversation with somebody.
*  And then to come back to your initial assumption
*  about eyes closed, a lot of practice,
*  even formal practice, can be done eyes open,
*  and it's important to do it eyes open,
*  because so much of our anchoring of our sense of self
*  is based on visual cues.
*  I mean, we know that if you give people the right visual cues,
*  you can translocate their sense of self.
*  You can give them an out-of-body experience
*  with a video display,
*  where you can literally make them feel like
*  there's a body-swapping illusion.
*  You can make them feel that they're in another person's body
*  looking back at their body
*  if you run the cameras the right way.
*  I've done this in VR, seeing an image of,
*  they create an avatar for you,
*  and then your bodily movements generate
*  the movements of the avatar,
*  and you start gaining presence,
*  as they call it in the VR lingo, very quickly,
*  and then pretty soon,
*  you lose sense of your own bodily representation.
*  And it's a little eerie.
*  What's eerie to me is going back into,
*  of course, never left,
*  but back into your actual body when the VR goggles pop off,
*  the world seems almost overwhelming
*  the number of sensory stimuli
*  that are in a laboratory room,
*  which is actually quite sparse.
*  So exactly what you described,
*  this translocation of notions of self
*  through visual experience.
*  But conversely, when you lose the sense of self,
*  the sense of self I'm talking about,
*  it can be especially vivid and salient with eyes open,
*  because so many of your reference points to selfhood
*  are delivered visually, right?
*  Especially in a social situation.
*  So like, I'm talking to you,
*  you're looking back at me, right?
*  So the implication of your gaze
*  is that I'm over here behind my face,
*  implicated by your gaze.
*  So the sense that you're looking at something
*  is the sense of self in that social context, right?
*  And if your facial expression changes,
*  like so I'm saying something,
*  and if you kind of furrow your brow,
*  like, well, what the hell's,
*  and I can read into that facial change,
*  some interstate of yours that is salient to me,
*  all of a sudden we've got this sort of dance of,
*  like, I'm noticing you reacting to me,
*  and that's changing the way I'm feeling about what I'm,
*  that's the purview of every neurosis
*  everyone didn't want, right?
*  And every relationship.
*  I had a girlfriend when I was a postdoc
*  who was very, very, she was brilliant really, still is.
*  And she always said that every relationship,
*  they're referring, they're four arrows,
*  she used to say, she's an arrow scientist, still is.
*  And said, you know, there's the arrow of, you know,
*  she was talking to me, so she said, you know, me to you,
*  and kind of what you perceive coming from me,
*  and then there's you to me,
*  and then there's an arrow from the middle
*  going right back at each one of us,
*  which is our own perception
*  of what the other person is thinking about us,
*  and it's feeding back on the other arrow.
*  And she gave me this very clear,
*  but model of basically relationships.
*  The relationship failed,
*  but it was good while it lasted, I should say.
*  But the four arrow model of relationships
*  actually shows up in every type of one-on-one relationship,
*  and it's probably an under description
*  of the total number of arrows,
*  but I think it's exactly what you're describing,
*  is that perception of self through the eyes of other,
*  whether or not we're empathic or not,
*  strongly shapes the way that we access
*  different context-dependent rule sets
*  about what we're gonna say and not gonna say.
*  It's very dynamic, right?
*  Yeah, so but the freedom that I think we want,
*  and people can sometimes experience this just haphazardly,
*  but the thing that, the center of the bullseye
*  from the meditative point of view
*  is to get off that ride entirely,
*  and so losing the sense of self in this context
*  of a social encounter is to give up your face, essentially.
*  And what that entails is, or what that gives you,
*  is the free attention to actually just pay attention
*  to the other person, right?
*  And the other person is now no longer
*  quite an object in the world for you.
*  There's really just a kind of a totality
*  of which that person is a part.
*  And actually, Martin Buber, the kind of mystical,
*  Jewish philosopher, talked about the kind of
*  the I-Thou relationship, and this, I think,
*  it's been a long time since I've read Buber,
*  but I don't know if he goes far enough
*  to be truly non-dualistic, but this distinction
*  between I and Thou, because the Thou part of it
*  is, I think, potentially this.
*  Again, it's been several decades since I read him,
*  but I think that's the kind of the,
*  I think it's been several decades since I read him.
*  But there's a way of beholding another person
*  where you have the free attention to simply behold them.
*  You're no longer care what they think about you.
*  You don't feel neuronically implicated by their gaze.
*  You don't feel, you're simply the space
*  in which they're appearing, and so you're free.
*  There's no, and people can feel,
*  and so by definition, you are no longer self-conscious.
*  And this phrase, self-consciousness,
*  really does get at this, what I'm calling the self,
*  the illusory self, as a kind of contraction.
*  And you can notice this for yourself.
*  Just imagine what it's like to go from
*  not being self-conscious to suddenly being self-conscious.
*  And the proximate cause of this,
*  almost invariably, is suddenly recognizing
*  that somebody's looking at you.
*  It's like you're in a Starbucks, and you're alone,
*  and you're reading the newspaper, whatever it is,
*  and this now sounds highly anachronistic.
*  It's been three years since I've held
*  a physical newspaper in a Starbucks.
*  But you're just minding your own business,
*  and you look up, and you're seeing a room full of strangers.
*  But then you notice that someone is just looking at you.
*  And so that moment of eye contact,
*  suddenly that throws you back on yourself
*  as a kind of, suddenly you're the object
*  in the world for that other person.
*  That recognition is, the tightening there,
*  the kind of contraction there,
*  is a further ramification of this feeling
*  most of us have most of the time
*  of being the center of experience.
*  Like the place you feel like, it's like,
*  we're all walking around with a fist,
*  and in moments of self-consciousness,
*  the fist gets really tight.
*  That's the thing that gets fully relaxed
*  when you discover this, what I'm,
*  at various points, call the nature of mind,
*  or the non-dual nature of consciousness,
*  is just that there is no center to this experience.
*  And when you recognize no center,
*  then even when your gaze is aimed at another person's gaze,
*  there is no implication going back to the center,
*  because there is no center.
*  And rather than that being an experience
*  of weird detachment or confusion,
*  or it's actually an experience of greater relationship,
*  because you're no longer, you're no longer defending it.
*  You're not defending anything over here.
*  You're not braced against anything.
*  You're just the space in which that person is showing up.
*  And so it's an experience of being much more comfortable
*  in the presence of another person,
*  whatever your relationship,
*  because you're not contracting.
*  And then when you do, when you have that,
*  again, and this is meditation,
*  this is meditation that is totally compatible
*  with having a conversation with somebody.
*  And then when you notice yourself contracting,
*  like when you notice you're not doing,
*  you're not meditating anymore, you're just,
*  you're actually reacting.
*  Like they just said something or looked a certain way,
*  and now you're cast back upon yourself
*  in relationship to them.
*  That becomes a kind of mindfulness alarm, right?
*  Then you know that it becomes like the,
*  the unsatisfactoriness of that psychologically
*  becomes more and more salient, right?
*  And it's, because that's not,
*  one, that's not the way you wanna be,
*  and that's like it's the antithesis of it being
*  as comfortable as you were a moment ago.
*  But two, it's something you're doing unnecessarily, right?
*  Like it's like you're like, again, you're making a fist
*  when you don't have to make a fist, right?
*  And it's, again, we can leave aside all those circumstances
*  where it's appropriate to react to someone.
*  And I'm into martial arts and self-defense,
*  and yes, you're not supposed to be just this puddle of goo
*  out in the world who can be just mistreated by people
*  and never put up resistance.
*  But it's psychologically,
*  even if a state like anger or contraction
*  is sometimes normative and appropriate,
*  the question is, how long is it normative
*  and appropriate for?
*  Like how long do you wanna stay angry for?
*  In my experience, these kind of classically
*  negative emotions like anger and fear
*  are appropriate as salience cues.
*  They orient you to an emergency or a potential emergency.
*  But then in dealing with the emergency,
*  they're almost never the state you wanna be in.
*  It's like it's better to actually be calm in an emergency.
*  Oh, absolutely.
*  I think that, and again, the language is insufficient
*  to describe what you're telling us,
*  but I think what comes to mind for me
*  is this distinction between situational awareness
*  and self-awareness.
*  And we need both, but under conditions of emergency,
*  true emergency or motivated desire,
*  we need to dial down the amount of self-awareness
*  in order to be more effective
*  within the situational awareness.
*  But you said something very important,
*  and my lab has been working on fear-like states
*  for a long time, so I confess I'm gonna rob this from you,
*  but I'll credit you every time I describe it,
*  is that the fear of the threat detection state
*  or set of events acts as a flag,
*  but is not meant to persist in the way
*  that the flag went up if one is to be
*  in their most adaptive state.
*  Actually, Jocko Willink and I were talking about this.
*  He talks a lot about detachment and open gaze,
*  things that my lab is interested in,
*  visual system and autonomic interaction.
*  So why broadening the gaze literally
*  broadens the time domain of thinking.
*  You've come up with new solutions
*  to complex problems in real time and so on,
*  and you're describing everyday set of interactions
*  where that could be very useful.
*  And yet there seems to be something
*  about the way you describe meditation
*  and what you've managed to arrive at
*  on what practitioners of meditation can arrive at,
*  which is something more than that.
*  It's not just about being effective or optimizing
*  all the language we see thrown around a lot
*  in the space that I live in these days,
*  but something fundamentally more important
*  about how to experience life and the self,
*  this realization that what you thought was there
*  was never really there,
*  but that there are constraints that limit that.
*  And so to try and fracture those constraints one by one,
*  would you say that meditation as a practice
*  done for a few minutes each day or with the app,
*  that it's a kind of a step function,
*  is a very nonlinear in terms of people's progress?
*  I'm certainly gonna go start doing more meditation
*  based on this discussion, truly,
*  because anytime someone describes
*  that there's kind of a myth that we've been living in,
*  I become obsessed with the idea of dissolving that myth.
*  That's a very seductive phrase,
*  so thank you for using that one.
*  There is no better marketing tool,
*  which is I realize what you're not trying to do here,
*  but that's for me to capture my efforts.
*  You tell me that there's a myth that I'm living in
*  and that it can be dissolved
*  and that opens up a better landscape.
*  What is the process like?
*  Do some people make progress very quickly?
*  Do some people experience step functions towards progress?
*  What does the meditation practice look like over time?
*  Do you still meditate or have you just threaded it
*  through your jujitsu, your writing, your daily life,
*  your coffee, your time with your wife, et cetera?
*  Yeah, so just to come back,
*  just to talk about the myth for a second.
*  So they're really, what you just enunciated
*  was a kind of a second doorway into this whole project.
*  So the usual door is through the door of suffering,
*  for lack of a better word.
*  People feel unhappy in a variety of ways
*  and they get more sensitized
*  to the mechanics of their own unhappiness.
*  And meditation is one of the things on the menu
*  that is explicitly billed as a remedy for unhappiness.
*  And it is, and I think that's probably
*  the most common path to this,
*  but another path is just intellectual interest.
*  I mean, just wanting to know what's real
*  about the mind subjectively, in a first person way.
*  And there's no contradiction between those two things.
*  I'm motivated by both of them,
*  but it's a totally valid doorway into this.
*  There are definitely step functions.
*  I mean, I would say there are at least two.
*  I mean, and they really are articulated
*  along the lines of the framework I've been describing
*  of dualistic and non-dualistic mindfulness.
*  So in the beginning, you're gonna start out,
*  99.9% of people will start out dualistically
*  paying attention and noticing the difference
*  between being distracted by thought
*  and then being on the object of attention,
*  whether it's the breath or sounds or whatever.
*  And eventually that opens up to all possible objects
*  of attention, including thoughts,
*  and there's still this fluctuation between being distracted
*  and then being mindful of whatever.
*  And the fact that it's open to all possible objects
*  differentiates this type of practice
*  from anything that is narrowly focused on one object,
*  like a mantra or a visualization or society.
*  Those are other paths of practice
*  that are more concentration-based and interesting,
*  but the benefit of mindfulness is that very quickly
*  you realize it's by definition compatible
*  with all possible experience,
*  because you're not artificially contracting
*  your attention down to something.
*  You're just being aware of the next thing,
*  a sight, a sound, a taste, a thought.
*  So the first step function is to very clearly experience
*  the difference between being lost in thought
*  and being clearly aware of any part of experience,
*  including thought, and to notice the freedom
*  that comparative psychological freedom that gives you.
*  So something's made you angry,
*  and now you're thinking about all the reasons
*  why you should be angry and have every right to be angry
*  and what you're gonna tell that person when you see them.
*  And then you notice your thinking,
*  and you notice the connection between the thought
*  and the anger.
*  The minute spent lost in thought about
*  what's making you angry is the thing that dragged
*  through the physiology of anger.
*  And the moment you notice that once you're mindful,
*  once you can be mindful, you can notice thought as thought
*  and how quickly that dissipates,
*  that just the language and the imagery,
*  just you couldn't hold onto it if you wanted to.
*  And then you notice the physiology of the anger
*  is just this kind of meaningless,
*  kind of inner incandescence that has its own half-life
*  and degrades very, very quickly
*  when you're no longer thinking about the reasons
*  why you should be angry.
*  You can't hold onto the anger.
*  The anger itself dissipates, right?
*  And from the point of view of the one who's being mindful,
*  this is tremendous relief.
*  I mean, and at minimum, it's a degree of freedom.
*  You can, at that point, decide,
*  well, how long do I wanna be angry for?
*  Is it useful to stay angry?
*  Do I wanna be angry for one minute, two minutes,
*  five minutes, 10 minutes?
*  Or, and before you have that capacity to be mindful,
*  you're gonna helplessly be as angry as you're gonna be
*  for as long as you're gonna be that way
*  just based on the time course of your thinking about it,
*  brooding about it, telling your wife about it.
*  It's just gonna be this conversation-based misadventure
*  in negative states of mind.
*  And you are going to be the hostage of that
*  for as long as you'll be the hostage of that.
*  You'll have nothing you can do apart from just deciding
*  to check out and watch Game of Thrones again
*  for the third time, right?
*  Like it's just, you can divert your attention
*  to something else, which is sometimes a good thing to do,
*  but mindfulness, even dualistic mindfulness,
*  gives you this capacity to just observe
*  the mechanics of this and then get off the ride
*  whenever you want.
*  So that really is a step function.
*  First, there was a time before you could do that,
*  and then there's a time after which you can do that.
*  The other step function is noticing
*  that there is no one who is doing that.
*  I mean, this is the non-duality, the selflessness,
*  the centralness of awareness, right?
*  The fact that there's no place from which
*  the mindfulness is being aimed,
*  but the fact that there's just this open condition
*  in which everything is appearing, thoughts included.
*  To have you, at that point, your mindfulness
*  no longer becomes, it's no longer this dualistic effort
*  to strategically pay attention to anything,
*  as opposed to being lost in thought.
*  It's just what's left when thoughts,
*  when the present recognized thought unravels,
*  even before it unravels, what's recognized is
*  you are simply identical to the condition
*  in which everything is appearing.
*  Now again, this is not a, I'm not making a
*  a Deepak Chopra-like metaphysical claim about the mind,
*  I'm not saying the mind isn't what the brain is doing,
*  I'm not saying that you're recognizing the consciousness
*  that gave birth to the universe,
*  I'm not making any broad claims about metaphysics,
*  I'm just talking about as a matter of experience,
*  there is just this condition
*  in which everything is appearing, right?
*  And what you're calling your body,
*  again, as a matter of experience,
*  I'm not saying that we can't have third-person conversations
*  about physical bodies in the physical world,
*  but as a matter of experience,
*  the only body you're ever going to directly encounter
*  as your own is an appearance in consciousness.
*  So consciousness is not in your body,
*  what you're calling your body is in consciousness.
*  Visually, proprioceptively,
*  it's like everything is just appearing in this condition.
*  And again, you're not aiming,
*  this is not a spotlight that you're aiming at the body,
*  or at, there's just this condition in which everything,
*  including anything you could call yourself, is appearing.
*  And so, yeah, so that's the second step function
*  is to recognize that this is already true.
*  Consciousness is already without this thing
*  you've been calling your ego,
*  hoping to unravel it through meditation.
*  Consciousness is not going to get any more selfless,
*  any more centralist, any freer than it always already is,
*  recognized as such.
*  And so that's the step function at that point is,
*  your mindfulness at that point,
*  the thing you come back to when you're no longer distracted
*  is that recognition again and again.
*  And then it becomes, yeah,
*  it becomes compatible with anything you would do.
*  And so to answer your question,
*  yes, I still practice formally sometimes, frequently,
*  but not, I definitely miss days and I don't do it for,
*  I mean, I don't rule out the possibility
*  that I will go back on retreat at various times
*  just to check in with that and see if that makes a difference.
*  But I tend to sit for, I mean, I've designed my life
*  so that I can spend a lot of time meditating
*  without having to be formally meditating.
*  So I'll go for a hike for two hours, right?
*  And what I'm doing when I'm hiking is identical
*  to what I'm doing when I'm, quote, meditating,
*  sitting in a chair doing nothing but meditate.
*  So it's, yeah, I mean, I just, again,
*  I'm very interested in erasing the boundary
*  between what people are calling meditation
*  and the rest of life.
*  And so in teaching these things,
*  I tend to emphasize that from the beginning
*  because I think it's very easy to set up,
*  to get gulled by a bunch of assumptions
*  that cause you to be very split in your sense
*  of what your life is about.
*  And I'm sort of banking my meditation over here
*  because I'm meditating two hours a day diligently
*  and this is gonna be really good for me.
*  And then over here is the rest of my life,
*  which is not nearly as wise or as useful
*  or as like this is the stuff that is still
*  the area of my problems.
*  And I think it's useful to recognize
*  you've got one life, you know,
*  and you've got this single condition of consciousness
*  and its contents in every mode of life
*  and there's something to recognize about it
*  and you're always free to recognize that.
*  Truly even in your dreams, right?
*  I mean, it's just not, it never stops.
*  So that's what I tend to emphasize.
*  So earlier you told us that meditation is not
*  about changing the content of conscious experience.
*  And in a different podcast that you were on,
*  I heard you say something to the effect of
*  that normally we are in our daily experience
*  and unless we are trained in meditation,
*  unless we've dissolved this illusion of the gap
*  between actor and self and observer,
*  that we require certain sensory events
*  to create collisions within us and with the natural world
*  that sort of blast us into a different mode of being.
*  I wanna use that as a way to frame up this idea
*  that some things such as psychedelics,
*  but also a very long hike, a very long fast
*  who knows a banquet, different types of life experiences
*  do exactly the opposite of what you're describing
*  meditation does, which is that they actively change
*  the content of our conscious experience.
*  So much so that we often remember those
*  for the rest of our lives.
*  Could you tell us why psychedelics can be useful?
*  And here I'll give the caveats that maybe you'll feel
*  obligated to give as well, but this we're talking about
*  use safely and responsibly age appropriate,
*  context appropriate, ideally with some clinical
*  or other type of guidance, legality issues obeyed, et cetera.
*  All that stated, psychedelics to me are an experience
*  of altered perception, internal and external perception,
*  altered space time relationship, somewhat dreamlike.
*  I think it was Alan Hobson at Harvard for a long time
*  talked about the relationship between psychedelic
*  like states and dreamlike states.
*  Because of this distortion of space time dimensionality.
*  And I haven't experimented with them much.
*  I've been part of a clinical trial, three doses of MDMA,
*  which certainly altered my, the quality of my conscious
*  experience in ways that led to a lot of lasting
*  and at least for me, valuable learning.
*  Yeah.
*  So what are your thoughts about psychedelics
*  in terms of how they intersect with the discussion
*  that we've been having and what utility do they play
*  in recognition of the self or in other sorts of brain changes?
*  Well, so yeah, let's just price in all those caveats
*  that people can anticipate.
*  These drugs are not without their risks.
*  And it's one problem is that we have this single term drugs
*  or psychedelics, which names many different types
*  of substances and they're not all the same.
*  So like MDMA is not even technically a psychedelic.
*  I think it has an immense therapeutic value
*  and it actually was my gateway drug
*  to this whole area of concern.
*  Amphetamine pathogen, right?
*  It's a sort of an amphetamine and a pathogen at the same time.
*  Yeah, I mean, it's often called.
*  Ampathogen.
*  Yeah, an ampathogen.
*  Not pathogen, M pathogen.
*  An ampathogen or an intactogen it's been called.
*  But it doesn't tend to change perception
*  in the way that classic psychedelics do.
*  And it's also serotonergic, but it's not,
*  it has to be in some part differently so than,
*  I mean, even LSD and psilocybin,
*  which are much more similar in classic psychedelics,
*  both are also serotonergic, but they're not merely so.
*  And they're also different.
*  And the higher dose you take of these drugs,
*  the more you, at lower doses,
*  everything can kind of seem the same.
*  At higher doses, they begin to diverge.
*  And we can talk about the pharmacology if you wanted to,
*  but I would just say that for many of us,
*  I mean, certainly for me, psychedelics were indispensable
*  in the beginning in proving to me that this was,
*  that a first person interrogation of the mind
*  was worth doing, you know,
*  because I was somebody who, age 17 or 18,
*  before I had any real experience with MDMA or LSD
*  or psilocybin, if you had taught me how to meditate
*  at that point, I think I would have just bounced off
*  the whole project.
*  I think my mind was, I was just,
*  I was so cerebral in my, just my engagement with anything.
*  I was so skeptical of any of the spiritual,
*  the religious and spiritual traditions
*  that have given us most of our meditation talk, you know,
*  that I think I just would have,
*  and I know many of these people,
*  like I have tried to teach, you know,
*  Richard Dawkins to meditate
*  and Daniel Dennett to meditate.
*  I've ambushed them with meditation,
*  and both in a group setting and one-on-one,
*  not Dan, but Richard, I ambushed on my own podcast
*  with a guided meditation.
*  And he just, you know, from his,
*  he closes his eyes, he looks inside,
*  and there's nothing of interest to see, right?
*  Like it's just, it's like, it's not,
*  he doesn't have the conceptual interest in him
*  that would cause him to persist long enough
*  to find out that there's a there there, right?
*  Now, this is not a problem with LSD or psilocybin or MDMA.
*  I know that if I gave him 100 micrograms of LSD
*  or five grams of mushrooms, or, you know,
*  20, you know, 25 milligrams of psilocybin,
*  that's probably not the analogous dosage
*  to the five grams of mushrooms.
*  Five grams of mushrooms would be more than that.
*  I forget what it is of MDMA, maybe 120 milligrams of.
*  I think the MAPS dose is,
*  which is the one that's under clinical trials,
*  is 125 milligrams with the option of a 75 milligram booster.
*  Right, right, right.
*  Funny I wouldn't remember that.
*  Yes, it's strange, the facts that come to hand.
*  Exactly.
*  There's just no possibility
*  that nothing's gonna happen right now.
*  Something with a psychedelic, with MDMA,
*  most people tend to have,
*  certainly under any kind of guidance,
*  tend to have a very positive, you know,
*  pro-social experience.
*  But, you know, with a psychedelic,
*  you might have a somewhat terrifying experience
*  if you have, we'll quote, a bad trip,
*  you know, and I've certainly had those experiences
*  on LSD and to some degree on psilocybin.
*  But the prospect that nothing is gonna happen
*  is just in, you know, nearly a million cases
*  out of a million, just not in the cards.
*  I mean, just neurophysiologically,
*  something's gonna happen with the requisite dose
*  of one of these drugs.
*  And if that thing that happens,
*  if that thing that happens is psychologically
*  at all normative and, you know, pleasant
*  and interesting and valuable,
*  which it is so much of the time,
*  and certainly under the appropriate, you know,
*  set and setting and guidance,
*  it can be, you know, a lot of the time
*  for virtually everybody.
*  Again, there are caveats.
*  If you're prone, if you think you have, you know,
*  a proclivity for schizophrenia or, you know,
*  bipolar disorder, this is almost certainly not for you.
*  You know, and anyone doing the studies
*  at like Johns Hopkins for the therapeutic effects
*  of any of these drugs, they're ruling out people
*  with, you know, first degree relatives
*  with any of these clinical conditions.
*  But so for somebody like me at 18,
*  who didn't know that this was an area
*  of not only interest, but would it be the, you know,
*  the center of gravity for the rest of his life
*  if only he could pay attention clearly enough
*  to see that it could be, right?
*  I was someone who very likely, again, I don't know,
*  I don't have the counterfactual in hand.
*  I don't know what would have happened
*  if someone had, you know, forced me to meditate
*  for an hour at that point.
*  But I know I wasn't interested in it.
*  Until I took MDMA, I know I wasn't having
*  these kinds of experiences spontaneously
*  that showed me that there was an inner landscape
*  that was worth exploring.
*  I was a very hard-headed skeptic
*  who was very interested in lots of things,
*  but there was no alternative to me
*  just thinking more about those things, right?
*  I mean, the idea that there's some other way
*  of grasping cognitively at the interesting parts
*  of the world beyond thinking about the world, right?
*  I just, that just wouldn't have computed for me at all, right?
*  And if you had, so I just, and I literally,
*  no one ever gave me a book to read or,
*  I don't know, the noun meditation very likely
*  meant absolutely nothing to me before I took my first dose
*  of, in this case it was MDMA.
*  So what the drug experience did for me is it just proved,
*  I mean, so one of the limitations of a drug
*  is that obviously no matter how good the experience,
*  the drug wears off and then you're back
*  in more or less your usual form,
*  and now you have a memory of the experience.
*  And it can be a fairly dim memory.
*  I mean, some of these experiences are so discontinuous
*  with normal waking consciousness
*  that it can be like trying to remember a dream
*  that just disappeared, it degrades over the course
*  of seconds and then it could have been
*  the most intense dream you've ever had,
*  and for whatever reason you can barely get a purchase
*  on what it was about.
*  And there's some psychedelic experiences
*  that are analogous to that, but for most people,
*  most of the time there's a residue of this experience,
*  and with something like MDMA they can be quite vivid.
*  Where you recognize, okay, there was a way of being
*  that is quite different than what I'm tending
*  to access by default, and it is different in ways
*  that are just obviously better
*  and psychologically more healthy.
*  I mean, it's possible to be healthy psychologically
*  in a way that I never imagined.
*  And then when you link it up to the traditional literature
*  around any of this stuff, again, so much of it
*  is shot through with superstition
*  and otherworldliness of religion.
*  And as you know, and I think your listeners probably know,
*  I've spent a lot of time criticizing all that,
*  but there is a baby in the bathwater to all of that.
*  It's not that somebody like Jesus or the Buddha
*  or any of the matriarchs and patriarchs
*  of the world's religions, it's not that they
*  were all conscious frauds or temporal lobe epileptics.
*  There's a pathological lens that you can put
*  on top of all that, but once you have one
*  of these experiences on psychedelics
*  or on a drug like MDMA, you know that there's a there there.
*  You know that unconditional love is a possibility.
*  You know that feeling truly one with nature,
*  I mean, just so one with nature that you could spend
*  10 hours in front of a tree and find that
*  to be the most rewarding experience of your life.
*  That's a possible state of consciousness.
*  Now, it may not be the state of consciousness
*  you want all the time.
*  You don't wanna be the crazy guy by the tree
*  who can't have a conversation about anything else,
*  but once you have one of these experiences,
*  you recognize, okay, there's some reason why
*  I'm not having the beatific vision right now,
*  and I can't even figure out how to aim my attention
*  so as to have anything like it, and that's a problem,
*  because it's available, and it's the best,
*  it is among the best things that has ever happened to me,
*  and now I can just only dimly remember what that was like.
*  So how do I get back there on some level?
*  So that invites, again, a logic of changes,
*  a logic of seeking changes in the contents of consciousness,
*  which sets someone up for this protracted
*  or seemingly protracted and fairly frustrating search
*  to game their nervous system so as to have
*  those kinds of experiences more and more.
*  And again, it's not that that's in principle fruitless,
*  but it is from the point of view of the core insight,
*  of the core wisdom of what I would take
*  from a tradition like Buddhism, which is not,
*  it's not the only tradition that has given voice to this,
*  but I would argue has given it voice to it
*  in the most articulate way.
*  Again, leaving aside any of the superstition
*  and otherworldliness and miracles
*  that we don't have to talk about at the moment,
*  and you certainly don't need to endorse
*  in order to be interested in this stuff.
*  And so that's the bifurcation between
*  all of the utility of psychedelics
*  and what I'm talking about under the rubric of meditation
*  is at this point of, okay, once you realize
*  there's a there there, what do you do
*  and what's the logic by which you're led to do it?
*  And it's possible, if your only framework is
*  the good experiences, the good feels you had
*  on whatever drug it was, and a further discussion
*  of what that path of changes can look like,
*  and that can come in a religious context,
*  it can come in just a purely psychedelic context,
*  or some combination of the two,
*  I think you can be misled to just seek
*  lots of peak experiences, you're just trying
*  to string together a lot of peak experiences
*  hoping they're gonna change you,
*  every one of which by definition
*  is going to be impermanent.
*  I mean, it's first it wasn't there, then it's there,
*  and then it's no longer there,
*  and then you've got a memory of it.
*  What I think it's, what everyone really wants,
*  whether they know it or not, and they're right to want,
*  is a type of freedom that is compatible
*  with even ordinary states of consciousness,
*  which can ride along with them
*  into extraordinary states of consciousness.
*  I mean, so what I hadn't done psychedelics for 25 years,
*  because again, they were super useful for me
*  in the beginning, then I discovered meditation
*  on the basis of those experiences,
*  got really into meditation and realized,
*  okay, this is a much more, this really is,
*  conceptually this makes much more sense to me,
*  this is delivering the goods in terms of my experience.
*  There's no need to keep having these,
*  seeking these peak experiences with drugs.
*  But it had been 25 years since I had done that,
*  and there was this resurgence in research on psychedelics,
*  and I was being asked about psychedelics,
*  and I was talking about their utility for me,
*  but again, these were distant memories,
*  and there was also one type of psychedelic experience
*  I was aware that I had never had.
*  I had never done a high dose of mushrooms blindfolded.
*  Like every mushroom trip I'd ever had,
*  I'd been out in nature and interacting with,
*  it's just been a very transformed sensory experience
*  of the world and of other people.
*  But I had never done it alone, blindfolded,
*  just purely inwardly directed and at a high dosage.
*  I'd done high doses of LSD,
*  but not mushrooms.
*  So I did that, and it was very useful,
*  and I spoke about it on my podcast,
*  and there's actually, I think if you search
*  Sam Harris mushroom trip on YouTube,
*  you get the 19 minute version of that,
*  of my describing that trip.
*  It was incredibly useful,
*  but what was doubly useful was my mindfulness training
*  in the context of that explosion of synesthesia.
*  I mean, it was such an overwhelmingly strong experience,
*  and there were so many moments where
*  it could have gone one way or the other
*  based on my sense of just, okay,
*  I'm gonna try to resist this.
*  It was just like, it was in truth irresistible
*  because it was just so much,
*  but there were moments where I was aware of,
*  okay, this is like letting go of self in this context
*  is the thing that is going to make the difference
*  between heaven and hell here,
*  because there are experiences that are so extreme
*  that you can't even tell if it's agony or ecstasy.
*  It's just, everything is turned up to 11, right?
*  And the difference between the two is like,
*  the tipping point is just,
*  really is kind of a high wire act in some sense.
*  You could just fall to one side or the other.
*  And yeah, so what I think people want is,
*  they certainly wanna be able to extract
*  from the psychedelic experience wisdom
*  that is applicable to ordinary states of consciousness.
*  It's like, what is the thing you can realize
*  in a moment of having a conversation with your child
*  that isn't distracting you from that relationship?
*  It's not a memory of when the world dissolved
*  or when you were indistinguishable from the sky,
*  but it's just a way of having free attention
*  and unconditional love in this totally ordinary
*  and potentially chaotic human experience,
*  which can be psychologically fraught
*  and you can meet iterations of yourself
*  that you don't like, that are not equipping you
*  to be the best possible person in that relationship.
*  And what we wanna do is cut through all of that
*  and actually be in love with our lives
*  and with the people in our lives more and more of the time.
*  And I'm not saying that repeated psychedelic journeys
*  can't be integral to that project,
*  but you know that the project
*  can't be being high all the time.
*  So whatever is extractable from the occasional psychedelic
*  trip has got to be mappable
*  into ordinary waking consciousness.
*  And the real point of contact does run through this,
*  what I've been calling the illusion of the self.
*  And again, that part is discoverable
*  without any changes in contents.
*  So you don't have to suddenly feel the energy of your body
*  be rush out and be continuous with the ocean of energy
*  that is not your body.
*  That's an experience that's there to be had.
*  There's no doubt.
*  But the truth is, just looking at this cup
*  is just as formless and as mysterious as that, right?
*  When it's seen in the right way.
*  And that's what meditation encourages to want to recognize.
*  I share the experience that MDMA significantly altered
*  my perception of what's possible in terms of
*  an emotional stance towards self and others,
*  including animals, right?
*  And that's something that runs very deep for me
*  and that I had been kind of actively suppressing
*  in anticipation of having to put my dog down.
*  But also, I don't know how to frame it,
*  except to say my lab did animal research for years
*  and I was always very conflicted about it.
*  Because I love animals and yet I wanted to understand
*  the brain and we need to work on animal brains.
*  Rodents or what?
*  Yeah, I'll be very direct about this.
*  I've worked on many species.
*  I've worked on mice and rats.
*  I've worked on, admittedly, I've worked on,
*  I've done some cat experiments.
*  I've worked on large non-human primates, including macaques.
*  I no longer work on any of those species.
*  I've worked on cuttlefish, cephalopods,
*  a discussion for another time,
*  brilliant little creatures,
*  maybe as smart as us or who knows, maybe smarter.
*  And now I work on humans because I couldn't reconcile
*  the challenge inside me, which was my love of animals
*  and working on them.
*  I just couldn't do it any longer.
*  And MDMA didn't set that transition.
*  That transition actually had been set a lot earlier.
*  It was something I really grappled with.
*  It didn't keep me up at night,
*  but it was always in the back of my mind.
*  In any event, I hope what we discovered was worthwhile,
*  but that's a bigger debate.
*  And I have strong feelings about this
*  and maybe it's a topic for another podcast.
*  But I'm very happy that now I work on humans
*  and they can tell me if they want to be part
*  of the experiment or not.
*  And I trust them and I trust their answers.
*  I think that MDMA in its role as an empathogen,
*  I think really did set an understanding
*  of what's real and true.
*  So think truths like that become,
*  I felt that they didn't hit me square in the face.
*  I just could, the feeling behind the conflict
*  made itself evident and what to do about it
*  made itself evident.
*  So I suppose MDMA did assist the transition
*  to purely human research as opposed to animal research.
*  The other thing that I noticed it did is
*  it made it not scary to confront things
*  that were scary to confront in my conscious life.
*  And I could think about things in my conscious life,
*  but it brought them close in a way
*  that I could get closer and closer to the flame
*  and then gain some understanding.
*  I've still amazed at how answers are made
*  and how they arrive both during the session
*  and then the weeks and months that follow.
*  If one puts the attention to it,
*  I think that's why it's important to have a guide
*  of some sort or to have some pseudo structure
*  because otherwise one can get attached
*  to the sounds in the room and there's probably meaning there
*  but I wanted to do some deeper work.
*  I have not had experience with psilocybin
*  at least not since my youth
*  and I don't recommend young people do it.
*  I regret doing LSD and psilocybin as a young person.
*  I don't say that for politically correct reasons
*  or liability reasons.
*  I just think my mind was not developed
*  but I'm intrigued by something.
*  So here's the question.
*  How is it that psilocybin in particular
*  and high dose psilocybin and the ego dissolution
*  that people talk about on psilocybin,
*  how do you think that lines up with some of the experiences
*  that you've been describing
*  for a adequate meditation practice?
*  Because that's something that I did not experience on MDMA.
*  In fact, if anything, I experienced for the first time
*  what really feeling like a isolated container was
*  and the difference between, and how empathy
*  and being bounded, having in other words,
*  good boundaries and empathy could be symbiotic.
*  I experienced that for the first time there
*  and I do think that there is learning inside of these states
*  that translates into everyday life
*  when one is not on these states.
*  The last thing I'll say is no,
*  I don't feel the impulse to go and do 20 more MDMA sessions.
*  I think that the three as part of this study
*  were very effective for me.
*  And as they say, if you hear the calling again,
*  you might do it, but I'm very curious about psilocybin
*  in particular and this notion of ego dissolution
*  because we've been talking about the self.
*  Well, so there are different ways
*  in which the sense of self can be eroded or expanded
*  or there's lots of experiences that can still have
*  a kind of center to them, but be very novel
*  and transformational and one can reify those
*  as a kind of goal state, right?
*  And it's sort of the, there's a concept in Buddhism
*  that I think is useful.
*  It doesn't translate well to English
*  or it can set up kind of false associations in English
*  that are unfortunate, but so there's a concept
*  of emptiness in Buddhism which sounds again kind of gray
*  and dispiriting in English,
*  but it's, what it's, cognate terms are things
*  like unconditioned, unconstrained, open, centralists, right?
*  So it's, there's a, and that is,
*  when I'm talking about non-duality,
*  when I'm talking about the loss of a sense of subject
*  and then what's left, in Buddhism they would often describe
*  what's left as emptiness, but emptiness is not a something.
*  It's not a, and importantly, it's not the same thing
*  as unity, right, so it's not a oneness, right?
*  Because it's, what's left, when the center drops
*  out of experience, it's not like you are suddenly merged
*  with the cup, right?
*  It's, but now granted, this is where psilocybin
*  and other psychedelics can give a false impression
*  of I think what the goal is, you can have kind,
*  seeming merging experience, you can have unity experiences
*  on psychedelics which can be quite powerful,
*  especially with nature, with other people and with nature
*  where you can just feel like the energy of your body
*  becomes incredibly vivid and powerful.
*  It's just like you're just, everything is just buzzing
*  with life energy and then when you touch another person's
*  hand or you touch a tree, there can be this sort of continuity
*  of energy which can be this overwhelming experience
*  and again, this is just a 20 megaton change
*  in the contents of consciousness, right?
*  This is a non-ordinary state of consciousness,
*  but this gives some indication of what,
*  of how this happens.
*  Back in the day when I was in my 20s
*  and I was experimenting with, this was LSD,
*  but some friends and I decided, we had this brilliant idea,
*  we would camp above Muir Woods and then take some LSD
*  at dawn and then walk down, like a mile I think
*  from the campsite into the actual proper grove of trees
*  and commune with the giant redwoods,
*  the tallest trees on earth.
*  And so we dropped the acid at dawn and we start walking,
*  but the acid came on almost immediately
*  and we didn't get, we got nowhere near the woods
*  and we got stopped by a tree that was just like an ordinary,
*  20 foot oak tree, like the most boring tree in the world
*  and that tree absorbed the next six hours
*  of our conscious attention because it was just,
*  it was the tree of life.
*  I mean, it was just, it could be no better tree.
*  So we're talking about non-ordinary states of consciousness
*  wherein a merging with life and with the world is possible
*  and that is a, so I'm not saying that kind of experience
*  isn't possible, but there's a sort of expanded
*  self-reification, it is a kind of ego dissolution,
*  but there's a kind of egotism that sort of goes along
*  for the ride as well or can go along for the ride
*  and the real insight into emptiness,
*  the real sort of centerless, center of the bullseye
*  is a recognition that in some ways equalizes all experiences.
*  And again, it's just as available now
*  in this ordinary podcasting experience
*  as it is when you're merging hands-on with an oak tree
*  and on 400 micrograms of acid
*  and this is the whole universe.
*  And so it's the equality of those two experiences
*  that this concept of emptiness captures,
*  which a concept of oneness doesn't quite capture
*  because oneness is really this peak experience
*  of being dragged out of your somethingness
*  into a much bigger somethingness.
*  Emptiness is just no center.
*  And then everything is in its own place, right?
*  There's still sights and sounds and sensations
*  and thoughts and feelings, but there's no center
*  and there's no clinging to anything.
*  There's no clinging to identity,
*  there's no clinging to the good stuff,
*  there's no resistance to the bad stuff,
*  there's no, this is so pleasant and unpleasant,
*  gets sort of strangely equalized,
*  and it's very expansive and most importantly,
*  it doesn't block anything.
*  So yeah, if for whatever reason,
*  if your nervous system is set up to have the,
*  oh my God, I'm now merging with the tree experience,
*  that's possible from the state of no center, right?
*  And on my recent, now not so recent,
*  three years ago, it was right before COVID,
*  but my last big psychedelic experience,
*  I was very much experiencing that,
*  whereas insofar as I, at the peak,
*  there was no me to remember any of this stuff,
*  but insofar as I could experiment with
*  is this really different from anything else,
*  there is a kind of equalizing to the emptiness recognition,
*  even in the presence of a completely transformed
*  neurophysiology, and so that's,
*  again, there's a point of contact,
*  the real point of contact between psychedelics
*  and meditation for me is,
*  but for my experiences on psychedelics,
*  I think there's just no way I would have had
*  the free attention to be interested in the project at all.
*  And there are other aspects to the project,
*  it's not just having this insight into selflessness,
*  it's all of the ethical ramifications of that,
*  it's just like, what kind of person do you want to be?
*  What are your values?
*  What is a good life altogether
*  when you are talking about relationships
*  and political engagement and the changes
*  you can make in the world or not make?
*  Or it's just, what kind of person do you want to be?
*  There's a much larger consideration,
*  and as you discovered, an experience on MDMA
*  can really both expand your model
*  of what is possible and what is desirable,
*  what is normative, I mean, just what kind of self
*  do you want to be in the world?
*  And it can also help you cut through things
*  that are inhibiting your actualizing
*  any of those possibilities in ordinary waking consciousness.
*  I've certainly found that to be the case.
*  I mean, you raise a really important point,
*  which is that once these learnings take place,
*  these understanding stages,
*  these understandings take place
*  inside of psychedelic journeys,
*  and I do believe they translate to neuroplasticity.
*  I do want to highlight the point for people.
*  Oftentimes, people say, this mushroom or this psychedelic,
*  it opens plasticity,
*  but of course plasticity has to be directed someplace.
*  Plasticity is just a process, like walking
*  or anything else, underlying neural process.
*  And I think it's impossible for me to understand
*  what compartments of my life have been impacted
*  by these three MDMA sessions,
*  but in some ways, I wonder whether or not,
*  not just the transition away from animal research,
*  but also a deeper realization of the love
*  for learning and sharing information.
*  I won't go so far as to say this podcast is happening
*  because of that particular session,
*  but these things, they splay out
*  into multiple domains of the self.
*  And I do think that the key features
*  that feel most important to me to mention
*  are that it really identified true loves,
*  things that I truly love,
*  and made me less cautious about feeling
*  how intense those loves really are,
*  and then also lowered the inhibition point of exploring,
*  what would that mean?
*  And one of the reasons I bring this up
*  and why I think it's so important that you mention
*  some issues around politics and ethics,
*  and many things have splayed out
*  from your exploration of psychedelics, meditation,
*  neuroscience, philosophy, all the things that are you,
*  and of course, that's only a subset,
*  is that so much of what I hear and see,
*  so much of what I hear and see
*  in the kind of self-help space
*  contradicts itself and leads back to the origin
*  without a lot of progress.
*  And for instance, we hear,
*  absence makes the heart grow fonder,
*  but then out of sight, out of mind,
*  you hear about radical acceptance,
*  but then what if it's radical acceptance of non-acceptance?
*  I mean, there are some experiences in people
*  for which I radically accept the fact
*  that I want nothing to do with them.
*  And does that, am I supposed to transcend that?
*  So these are the questions I think that keep a lot of people
*  from exploring things like meditation,
*  because they feel like,
*  well, is the idea to just be okay with everything?
*  Is radical acceptance just like,
*  well, just bulldoze me with things even if they're,
*  and my goal is to somehow surpass the idea
*  that they're harmful.
*  And I don't think that's actually the way
*  any of this stuff is supposed to work,
*  although I don't claim to be the authority on it either.
*  I think notions of radical acceptance and radical honesty
*  and any number of different sayings
*  that one can find out there are really
*  the most salient beacons and guides
*  that most people have in order to try
*  and navigate tough areas in their life,
*  including the relationship to self,
*  to others and political orientations.
*  And so I feel like almost all those things
*  can be used to anchor down in a stance
*  that may or may not be informed or to open up to ideas.
*  And so I think that none of this can really be solved
*  in a single practice, it sounds like,
*  but it does seem to me,
*  based on what you've told us today,
*  is that only through a deep understanding of the self
*  as it really is, as opposed to this illusion
*  that you framed up, could we actually arrive
*  at some answers about what's actually right
*  for each and every one of us?
*  Yeah, I mean, there's one generic answer
*  that I think can be extracted both from psychedelics
*  and from meditation and just from just thinking
*  more clearly about the nature of our lives.
*  And it's to become more process-oriented
*  and to be more and more sensitive
*  to the mirage-like character of achieving our goals.
*  Right now, I'm not against achieving goals.
*  I have a lot of goals.
*  I'm very busy.
*  There are lots of things I wanna get done.
*  And I'm as satisfied as anyone to finish a project.
*  But if you look at the time course of all of that
*  fulfillment, and there are a few lessons
*  everyone, I think, has to draw.
*  One is most of your life is spent in the process.
*  Like the moment at which the goal is fully conquered,
*  that is just, I mean, that has a tiny duration
*  and it has a very short half-life.
*  And the moment you arrive at it,
*  it begins to recede because in the meantime,
*  you have all these other goals
*  that have appeared on the horizon.
*  You've got people asking what you're gonna do next.
*  And in some sense, if you're focused on goals,
*  you really can never arrive, right?
*  And I think what we're all looking for in life,
*  whether we're ever thinking about taking psychedelics
*  or practicing something like meditation,
*  we're looking for good enough reasons
*  to let our attention fully rest in the present.
*  That is the logic of success.
*  Like the sense, like I've got all these things I wanna do.
*  If I could just get rich enough or fit enough
*  or dial in my sleep well enough or improve my life
*  in all these ways, get the right relationship,
*  wouldn't it be great to be married?
*  I wanna start a family.
*  I want all of these things.
*  Why do I want these things?
*  I want these things because I'm telling myself,
*  it's not that all of those things are wonderful, right?
*  I'm not discounting those relative forms of happiness
*  or sources of happiness
*  because it's all completely valid to want those things.
*  But one thing is absolutely clear,
*  it's possible to be miserable
*  in the presence of all of those things, right?
*  And you can add great wealth and fame
*  and everything on top of that.
*  It's possible to be absolutely miserable
*  having everything anyone could seemingly want, right?
*  You just have to open a newspaper
*  to see people living out that predicament, right?
*  Spectacularly wealthy, famous, healthy, successful people
*  who could do anything they want in life apparently,
*  and yet they're doing this thing
*  that is completely dysfunctional
*  and making them needlessly miserable.
*  I won't name names.
*  There are enough of them out there.
*  Some people come to mind at the moment.
*  So there is a clear dissociation
*  between having everything and happiness that's possible.
*  And it's also possible to have very little and almost nothing
*  and to be quite happy.
*  I mean, you might not have met these people,
*  but I have met people who have spent 10 years alone
*  in a cave, right?
*  And they come out of that cave
*  not floridly neurotic or psychotic.
*  They come out of that cave beaming with compassion and joy.
*  And I mean, it's like they've been taking MDMA
*  for 10 years essentially, and they come out of the cave,
*  and now they're gonna talk about it, right?
*  And I'm not necessarily recommending that project to anyone,
*  but I'm just saying that is a psychological possibility.
*  So you have a double dissociation here,
*  whether you can have everything and be miserable,
*  you can have nothing and be beaming with happiness.
*  So what is it that we actually want
*  in all of our seeking to arrange the props in our lives
*  and the story, to have a convincing enough story
*  to tell about ourselves that we're doing the right thing?
*  What is all of that effort predicated on?
*  It's predicated on this desire and this expectation
*  that if we could get all of this stuff in the right place
*  and not have anything terrifying to worry about, right?
*  Everyone we love is healthy for the moment, right?
*  And we're healthy, and we've got something
*  to look forward to on the weekend,
*  and there's not a plumbing leak in the house
*  that we have to immediately respond to.
*  And we like our house, and our career is going fine,
*  and there's something good to watch on Netflix,
*  and we have all of it, right?
*  Now can we just actually give up the war, right?
*  Can we fully locate our sense of well-being
*  in the present moment?
*  Can we relax the impulse to brood about the past
*  or think anxiously about the future
*  for long enough to discover that all of this here is enough?
*  Because our life is, we have this finite resource of,
*  I mean, we absolutely have the finite resource of time,
*  but within the finite resource, the continuum of time,
*  we have the even more precious resource
*  of free attention that can find our fulfillment
*  in the present, right?
*  Because even if we're guarding our time
*  to do the things that are most important to us,
*  we can spend all of that time regretting the past
*  or anxiously expecting the future,
*  and just bouncing between past and future
*  in our thinking about ourselves and our lives,
*  and basically just dancing over the present
*  and never making contact with it, right?
*  So I think what we want is a circumstance
*  where attention can be located in the present
*  in a way that's truly fulfilling,
*  and unless you have had some kind of radical insight
*  that allows you to do that on demand,
*  you are in some sense hostage to the circumstances
*  of your life to do that for you.
*  You're constantly trying to engineer a state of the world
*  that will propagate back on a state of self
*  that will make the present moment good enough.
*  And what meditation does,
*  and psychedelics to some degree does this,
*  but meditation very directly does this,
*  it reverses the causality and lets you actually change states
*  such that you can be fulfilled before anything happens.
*  Your happiness is no longer predicated
*  on the next good thing happening.
*  You can be in the presence of the next good or bad thing
*  already being fulfilled and already being at peace.
*  I think there are misleading nouns
*  we can throw at what is left there,
*  but it is tranquility, peace, freedom,
*  lack of contraction, lack of conflict.
*  All of that can be more and more of a default.
*  And all of that is also compatible with deciding,
*  yeah, why not get in shape?
*  Why not engage this project?
*  Why not change your career?
*  It's not that you need to be somebody who,
*  to your point, you can notice all of these
*  non-optimal things, because no matter how much you meditate,
*  you're very likely going to spend a lot of your time
*  still lost in thought, still identified with it,
*  and still wanting, still caring about the difference
*  between dysfunction and normativity in your life.
*  And the question is, what can you locate when,
*  the question is really, how much can you puncture
*  that seeking happiness project with the recognition
*  that you're already free?
*  That's what meditation makes possible.
*  You can keep just a thousand times a day
*  letting some daylight into this search space.
*  But it is still compatible.
*  I mean, working out is a great way to do it.
*  I mean, working out is a great frame
*  in which to look at this, because in working out,
*  when you really work out, I'm thinking mostly,
*  I mean, it's really anything, but it's resistance training
*  or cardio or something like Jiu-Jitsu,
*  you're intentionally putting yourself
*  in classically unpleasant circumstances physiologically.
*  If you were, imagine what it's like
*  to do anything to failure, right?
*  Well, if you just check in on what that is like
*  at the level of sensation, I mean, that is,
*  it's basically a, it feels like a medical emergency, right?
*  I mean, like if you were having that experience
*  for some other reason, like if you woke up
*  in the middle of the night and felt what it feels like
*  to be deadlifting on your 10th rep on a set
*  where you're gonna, you would fail at 11, right?
*  That is just, that's an emergency,
*  but because you understand what you're doing in the gym
*  and you've sought it out and it's actually something
*  you like doing, right?
*  And you can get a real dopamine hit from doing it.
*  What you're doing when you're doing that
*  is you're owning a kind of a, you're actually
*  transforming a classically negative experience
*  into something that's almost intrinsically positive, right?
*  Certainly the net on it is positive.
*  You can do that, and being able to do that
*  is more and more the experience of being actually at peace
*  even while exerting really intense effort in one direction.
*  So you can be straining and I'm sure physiologically
*  showing a lot of stress.
*  I mean, I'm sure the cortisol is up
*  and blood pressure's up, heart rate is certainly up.
*  So it's like, as far as the body's concerned,
*  it's stress as far as the eye can see,
*  but you really can be deeply equanimous and at peace
*  because, again, because of the frame around it,
*  because of the concepts attached to it,
*  because you know what you're doing,
*  you know why it's happening and you want it.
*  So that's an attitude you can bring
*  into other stressful things that take effort to accomplish.
*  And so it's not that you just need to be a pushover
*  when you learn how to meditate or when you take MDMA
*  or you work on yourself in any of these ways,
*  but what I think you want to find
*  is you want to find your point of rest
*  in the midst of any struggle.
*  I would say that the, certainly MDMA,
*  and again, I have less experience with meditation,
*  but they really, I think, put us ultimately in positions
*  of what can only refer to as real strength.
*  These can make what before seemed like impossible decisions
*  or even concepts or emotional states
*  to even think about for any period of time
*  without deliberately distracting or avoiding
*  in some other way and be able to lean into those
*  with open eyes.
*  And I think that's, to me, that's my definition of strength.
*  I don't know what other people consider,
*  but there's definitely something real there in each case.
*  This may seem like a divergence,
*  but I and many other people are very curious
*  about a recent decision that you made,
*  which was to close your account on Twitter.
*  You still have an Instagram account, I noticed.
*  Although I never, I mean, my team manages that.
*  I've never.
*  It's a lot friendlier over at Instagram.
*  I've been there a lot longer.
*  I've never even seen it.
*  Oh, it's pretty good, actually, considering.
*  Imagine what would happen if you did,
*  they're doing a good job with it.
*  But your decision to close your account on Twitter,
*  I think, grabbed a lot of eyes and ears,
*  and there's a lot of questions about why.
*  It was a very large account.
*  It correlated with a number of things
*  that for the outsider, people might be wondering
*  about new leadership, new people who had been booted off,
*  brought back on, or at least invited back on, and so on.
*  You are certainly not obligated to explain your behavior
*  to me or anybody else for that matter,
*  but I'm curious if you might share with us
*  what the motivation was for taking the account down
*  and how you feel in the absence of,
*  your thumbs presumably are freed up to do other things.
*  I was getting an arthritic right thumb, I think.
*  If you don't mind sharing,
*  I think there's a lot of curiosity about you
*  and your routines.
*  You've been very generous in sharing that, your knowledge,
*  but also what makes you tick,
*  what motivates pretty big decisions like that.
*  It wasn't a major platform for you.
*  Right, yeah.
*  It was the only social media platform I've ever engaged.
*  Like you said, I have an Instagram,
*  I have a Facebook account,
*  but I never used those as platforms.
*  I was never on them, I've never followed people,
*  and all the posting has just come from,
*  it's just marketing from my team.
*  But Twitter was me, for better or worse,
*  and I began to feel more and more for worse.
*  And it was interesting because it was very,
*  I've talked about it a lot on my podcast,
*  about just my love-hate relationship with Twitter
*  over the years.
*  Many good things came to me from Twitter,
*  and I was following a lot of smart people,
*  and it had become my newsfeed
*  and my first point of contact with information each day,
*  and I was really attached to it just for that reason,
*  just as a consumer of content.
*  And then it was also a place where I genuinely wanted
*  to communicate with people and react to things,
*  and I would see some article that I thought was great,
*  and I would signal boost it to my,
*  the people following me on Twitter,
*  and that was rewarding,
*  and I could literally help people on Twitter.
*  There were people who I've raised lots of money for
*  on Twitter just by signal boosting their GoFundMe's,
*  and so I was engaged in a way that seemed productive,
*  but I was always worried that it was producing
*  needless conflict for me,
*  and was giving me a signal in my life
*  that I was being lured into responding to
*  and taking seriously that was out of proportion
*  to its representation of any opinion
*  or set of opinions that I should be taking seriously.
*  So I was noticing that,
*  and again, this evolved over years,
*  I mean, this long before,
*  long predated recent changes to Twitter,
*  but I was noticing that many of the worst things
*  that had happened for me professionally
*  were first born on Twitter.
*  I mean, just like some conflict I got into with somebody,
*  or something that I felt like I needed to podcast
*  in response to on Twitter,
*  it's so much of it, it's either its genesis was Twitter,
*  or the further spin of it
*  that became truly unpleasant and dysfunctional
*  happened on Twitter.
*  Twitter was part of the story when it got really bad,
*  and I've had vacations that have gone sideways
*  just because I got on Twitter and said something,
*  and then I had to produce a controversy
*  that I had to respond to,
*  and then I had to do a podcast about that,
*  and it was just, okay, this is a mess, right?
*  And so at that point,
*  I have friends who also had big Twitter platforms
*  who would say,
*  why are you responding to anything on Twitter?
*  Just tweet and ghost,
*  just due to having,
*  Joe Rogan sat me down and tried to get,
*  give me a talking to, as did Bill Maher,
*  and both of them engaged Twitter in that way.
*  I mean, I think they basically never look
*  at their at mentions,
*  they never see what's coming back at them,
*  they just, they use it effectively the way I use,
*  or don't even use Instagram or Facebook,
*  I don't even see what's going out there in my name,
*  and so I could essentially do that for myself
*  on Twitter, presumably,
*  and I did that for some periods of time,
*  but then I would continually decide,
*  okay, now it's all balanced again,
*  maybe I can just communicate here,
*  because it was very tempting for me
*  to communicate with people,
*  because I would see somebody clearly misunderstanding
*  something I had said on my podcast,
*  and I think, it's like,
*  why not clarify this misunderstanding, right?
*  And my efforts to do that almost invariably produced a,
*  I mean, sometimes it was a kind of a meandering process
*  of discovery, but often it was just kind of a stark
*  confrontation with what appeared to me to be just
*  lunacy and malevolence on a scale
*  that I never encounter elsewhere in my life,
*  like I never meet these people in life, right?
*  And yet, I was meeting these people
*  by the tens of thousands on Twitter,
*  and so the thing that began to worry me about it,
*  and again, I understand that people have
*  the opposite experience,
*  depending on what you're putting out,
*  and what you're, the kinds of topics you're touching,
*  you could have just nothing but love
*  coming back at you on Twitter, right?
*  But because I'm very essentially in the center politically,
*  and because I'm, this is now on my podcast,
*  this is not in the Waking Up app,
*  I'm often criticizing the far left,
*  and criticizing the far right,
*  I'm basically pissing off everyone some of the time, right?
*  And it's very different,
*  if you're only criticizing the left,
*  no doubt you get hate from the left,
*  but you have all the people on the right
*  who just reflexively and tribally
*  are expressing their solidarity for you, right?
*  And who are dunking on your enemies for you,
*  and when your enemies come out of the woodwork.
*  And if you're only criticizing the right,
*  I'm sure you get a lot of pain from the right,
*  but you've got the people on the left
*  who are tribally identified with the left,
*  who are just going to reflexively defend you.
*  If you're in the center, criticizing the left,
*  as hard as anyone on the right ever criticizes the left,
*  and you're also criticizing the right,
*  as hard as anyone on the left criticizes the right,
*  you're getting hate from both sides all the time,
*  and no one is reflexively and tribally defending you,
*  because you pissed them off last time.
*  You might be getting hate from the left now,
*  and the people on the right agree with you,
*  but they can't forget the thing you said about Trump
*  on that podcast two podcasts ago.
*  So they're not gonna defend you.
*  And so I basically created hell for myself on Twitter,
*  because it was just a theater of,
*  it was just pure cacophony most of the time.
*  And what I was seeing was,
*  I mean, there's no way there's this many psychopaths
*  in the world, but I was seeing psychopaths everywhere.
*  I was seeing the most malicious dishonesty,
*  and just goalposts moving, and hypocrisy,
*  and I mean, it was just, I mean, some of it's trolling,
*  and some of it's real confusion,
*  and some of it is psychopathy, but it's like,
*  it was so dark that I worried that it was actually
*  giving me a very negative and sticky view of humanity
*  that was, I mean, one, it was,
*  I think it isn't inaccurate,
*  but two, it was something I was returning to so much,
*  because again, I was checking Twitter
*  at least a dozen times a day,
*  and I'm sure there were some days
*  where I checked it 100 times a day.
*  I mean, it was, again, it was my main source of information.
*  I was constantly reading articles,
*  and then putting my own stuff out,
*  that it became this kind of funhouse mirror
*  in which I was looking at the most grotesque side
*  of humanity and feeling, you know,
*  implicated in ways that were important,
*  because it was just, it was reputationally important,
*  or seemed to be important.
*  I know a lot of these people.
*  These weren't just faceless trolls.
*  These are people with whom I have had relationships,
*  and in some cases, friendships,
*  who, because of what, you know,
*  largely Trump and COVID did to our political landscape
*  in the last half a dozen years,
*  were beginning to act in ways
*  that seemed starkly dishonest and crazy-making to me.
*  So I was just noticing that I was forming a view
*  of people who I actually have had dinner with
*  that was way more negative based on their Twitter behavior
*  than I think would ever be justified
*  by any way they would behave in life with me.
*  I mean, that's like, never,
*  I was never gonna have a face-to-face encounter
*  with any of these people that was this malicious
*  and dishonest and gaslighting and weird, right,
*  as was happening hourly on Twitter, right?
*  And so I just began to become more sensitive
*  to what this was, you know,
*  just the residue of all of this in my life,
*  and just how often the worst thing about me
*  in my relationship with the people in my life,
*  you know, they're just talking to my wife or my kids,
*  was just the fact that I had been on Twitter
*  at some point previously, in the previous hour,
*  and there was some residue of that, you know,
*  in my interaction with them.
*  You know, it's like, what are you stressed out about?
*  What are you annoyed about?
*  What are you pissed off about?
*  You know, what can't you get out of your head?
*  What is the thing that you now feel like you need
*  to spend the next week of your life focused on
*  because it went so sideways for you?
*  All of that was Twitter, you know.
*  I mean, literally 100% of that was Twitter.
*  And so I just, at one point,
*  it was actually on Thanksgiving Day,
*  I just looked at this, and I just,
*  I mean, there was very little thought went into it.
*  I mean, literally, I mean, you know,
*  there was more thought involved in you,
*  you know, whether I wanted coffee,
*  when you asked me when I showed up here,
*  I mean, it was just like, at a certain point,
*  I just saw it, and I just ripped the bandaid off,
*  and yeah, so, and to answer your other question,
*  it's been almost wholly positive, as you might expect,
*  given the litany of pain and discomfort I just ran through,
*  but I mean, it's surprising to recognize
*  how much of a presence it was in my life,
*  given the sense of what is now missing.
*  I mean, it's like, there's no question
*  there's kind of an addictive component to it,
*  and when you see, I mean, like,
*  when I look at what Elon's doing on Twitter,
*  forget about his ownership of it,
*  and I'm not, you know, I've got a lot to say about,
*  you know, the choices he's making for the platform,
*  but just his personal use of it
*  is just so obviously an expression of,
*  I mean, I don't know if addiction is
*  the clinically appropriate term,
*  but his dysfunctional attachment
*  to tweet to using the platform,
*  forget about changing it and owning it,
*  but just the degree to which it is
*  pointlessly disrupting the life
*  of one of the most productive people in any generation.
*  That was also instructive to me,
*  because I know Elon, and I just, you know,
*  he's, from a kind of a friend's eye view of the situation,
*  is so obviously not good for him
*  that he's spending this much time on Twitter.
*  That, I just brought that back to me,
*  it's like, well, if it's not,
*  this is what he's doing to Elon,
*  and he's got all these other things
*  he could be doing with his attention,
*  how much of my use of Twitter is actually, you know,
*  a good idea and, you know, optimized to my wellbeing
*  and the wellbeing of the people around me?
*  So anyway, it was, there was an addictive component to it,
*  I think, and so when that got stripped off,
*  I, you know, I do notice that there's,
*  I mean, there are times I pick up my phone,
*  and I realize this is like the old me
*  picking up my phone for a reason that no longer exists,
*  because it's not that much, you know,
*  I have a Slack channel with my team,
*  and I've got email, obviously, but it's like,
*  that is not much of what I was doing with my phone,
*  really, in the end, and so, like,
*  it's just my phone is much less of a presence in my life,
*  and so it's almost wholly good, but yeah,
*  you know, there's, I think there is some danger in,
*  or some possible danger in losing touch
*  with certain aspects of culture,
*  which again, I'm not even sure,
*  I mean, there's this question of, you know,
*  how much is Twitter real life,
*  and how much is it just a mass delusion?
*  I don't know, but insofar as it actually matters
*  what happens on Twitter,
*  or insofar as I was actually getting a news diet,
*  which I'm not gonna be able to recapitulate for myself,
*  or I'm just not, in fact,
*  going to recapitulate for myself, even if I could,
*  if any of that matters, I haven't discovered that yet,
*  but it's, yeah, I mean, there's,
*  it was taking up an immense amount of bandwidth,
*  and it's impressive, I mean, I think I said,
*  I, you know, it's like I amputated a phantom limb, right,
*  like it was not a real limb,
*  but it was this continuous presence in my life that,
*  that it's weird, it actually relates to the concept of self
*  in surprising ways, because I felt
*  there was a part of myself that existed on Twitter,
*  and I, you know, I just performed a suicide of that self,
*  right, like this is ending right now,
*  and you know, there's no residue,
*  there's nothing to go back and check,
*  there's just, it's gone,
*  and I didn't even, I didn't go back and look at my,
*  like what's interesting to consider is that,
*  you know, I'd been on Twitter for 12 years,
*  I don't keep a journal, I mean, Twitter,
*  my timeline would have been a kind of journal,
*  I could have gone back to a specific hour
*  and a specific day and looked at
*  what I was paying attention to,
*  I mean, that could have been an interesting record
*  of just who I've been for a decade,
*  and probably a pretty humbling record
*  of who I've been for a decade,
*  in terms of the kinds of things that captivated my attention,
*  but I didn't even, you know,
*  I didn't even think to go, you know,
*  nostalgically just look at any of that
*  or see if any of it was worth saving or archiving
*  or thinking, I just, just delete, you know,
*  and it was, and so my actual sense of who I am
*  and my engagement with my audience,
*  my, you know, the world of people
*  who could potentially know me,
*  like what does it mean to be, to have a platform,
*  you know, where do I exist digitally?
*  My sense of all of that got truncated in a way
*  that is much less noisy, I mean, it's amazing
*  how much can't get fucked up now in my life,
*  like it's like with Twitter, almost anything could happen,
*  right, like the next tweet was always an opportunity
*  to massively complicate my life.
*  There is no analogous space for me now,
*  and you know, so what I'm gonna say on your podcast,
*  what I'm gonna say on my own podcast,
*  what I'm gonna write next, that's much more,
*  you know, deliberative and the opportunities
*  to take my foot out of my mouth or to reconsider all,
*  you know, whether any of this is worth it,
*  is it worth, is this the hill I really wanna die on now?
*  It's much more, can be much more considered,
*  and I mean, I think all of that's to the good,
*  but even more important than that is there's not,
*  I'm not getting this continuous signal
*  that is always inviting a response,
*  whether on Twitter or on my own podcast or anywhere else,
*  and it's just much less noisy,
*  I mean, life is much less noisy and cluttered,
*  and that definitely feels better,
*  just that's 100% better.
*  I'm happy to hear that.
*  I know a number of people miss you there,
*  but you sound happy, I sense the genuine happiness in it.
*  Several things come to mind.
*  First of all, thank you for sharing your rationale there
*  and how it went, I think for a lot of people,
*  they think, oh, you must have like walked around
*  in circles for hours talking about everything.
*  No, it was-
*  It was a lead, as many good decisions are executed, right?
*  You know, I'm a big fan of Cal Newport's work, deep work.
*  In many ways, Cal's, I've never met him,
*  but we know each other through the internet space.
*  He really ahead of his time with this notion of deep work
*  and limiting distractions, I think he's even got a book
*  about a world without email or something,
*  but really extremely-
*  So he had, I mean, he deserves some credit
*  because he had been somewhat approximate cost of this.
*  He had been on my podcast and he had encouraged me
*  to delete Twitter because I had been sort of in,
*  in reaching some kind of crisis point with it
*  prior to that podcast.
*  And so we've talked about it and I had recorded
*  that podcast, but hadn't released it.
*  I actually recorded the podcast the day before
*  I wound up deleting Twitter, but hadn't yet released it.
*  So in my podcast with him, in the intro to it,
*  I then give a postmortem on my deleting it,
*  but he was one of the last people who was in my head
*  around these issues.
*  And I actually, that was not by accident.
*  I had invited him on the podcast
*  because I increasingly wanted to think about
*  whether this was totally dysfunctional.
*  Well, I'm a big fan of Cal Newport's
*  and I am on social media, I'm on Twitter.
*  I had some high-friction interactions there
*  and I have a process for dealing with those.
*  I tend to avoid high-friction confrontations online,
*  but Instagram is a much friendlier place.
*  By the way, if you wanted to come over
*  where the nice kids, the cool kids actually hang out.
*  Strangely, I'm not looking for a substitute.
*  Okay, well, don't let me entice you over there.
*  But I think that this notion of really being able
*  to access what Cal calls deep work,
*  what Rick Rubin talks about, being able to touch
*  the source of creativity and focus on a regular basis
*  does require that one have certain types of,
*  and in some cases, zero interaction with certain platforms
*  that merely being on a platform and blocking people
*  that would just won't provide.
*  I think a lot of energy opens up
*  and I'm fascinated by this concept of energy.
*  I mean, we only have so much energy,
*  neural energy to devote.
*  And in many ways, what you described,
*  there's really, I think, striking parallels
*  to what I've been talking about all along these last hours,
*  which is that sometimes the thing that feels so powerful
*  that has such a gravitational pull
*  and that we think this is experience, this is life,
*  this is just the way it is actually is an illusion
*  and when you step away from it,
*  you realize that there's this whole other dimension
*  of interactions that was available all along
*  that we, for whatever reason, were intervening in
*  by way of our reflexive, distracted behavior.
*  So I think there's a poetry there.
*  I was a hard case, but yeah, I got religion on this point
*  and it's a good change.
*  Well, Sam, I want to say a couple of things.
*  First of all, every time you talk, I learn so much
*  and that's in the dimensions of neuroscience,
*  even hardcore neural circuitry type stuff,
*  which is sort of my home.
*  When you talk about philosophy or meditation or psychedelics
*  and even politics, a topic that I'm aware of,
*  I'm woefully undereducated in,
*  but you have this amazing ability to blend
*  and synergize across things.
*  And I think today what occurs to me is that
*  not only is that no accident because of your training
*  and the rigor and the depth at which you've explored
*  these different topics, but also your openness to it.
*  But I think, at least for me, above all,
*  is because I think you are able to encapsulate
*  this idea of the self and the different ways
*  we each and all can potentially interact
*  with the environment and our inner landscape.
*  Your description of meditation, I have to say,
*  now has forever changed the way I think about meditation.
*  I would no longer just think of it as a perceptual exercise.
*  On the podcast, I've been talking about it
*  as something to do for these various benefits,
*  the benefit set of more focus, more stress,
*  et cetera, of which certainly exists.
*  But what you described today has such an allure
*  and holds such a promise that, as I mentioned,
*  I'm certainly going to change my behavior.
*  And I know I'm speaking on behalf of many, many people,
*  and I just want to extend my thanks
*  for your coming here today to teach us even more,
*  because of course, you have your podcast
*  and the app and the Waking Up app.
*  And the fact that regardless of the political landscapes,
*  regardless of what neuroscience feels about psychedelics
*  or where things are at any point in time,
*  you strike me as somebody who is very committed
*  to sharing knowledge and thoughtful, deep discourse
*  so that people can benefit.
*  And there are very few people like you.
*  In fact, there's probably only just one.
*  And so I feel very grateful to be sitting across
*  the table from him for these last hours.
*  Nice, nice.
*  Well, I really enjoyed this.
*  And I want to congratulate you on what you've built here
*  because your podcast is everywhere.
*  I'm a fan, and even more than that,
*  I'm continually seeing the evidence of you reaching people
*  and benefiting people.
*  And it's just really, I mean, this is the,
*  one of the best examples of new media
*  just carving out a space that people didn't really know
*  existed, because this is not television, it's not radio,
*  it's not, and all of a sudden people have time
*  to hear a conversation of great length
*  that goes into nitty-gritty scientific detail
*  on hormones.
*  I mean, who would have thought that was even possible?
*  And so, yeah, I would just, congratulations.
*  It's fantastic to see.
*  And I'm just very happy for the opportunity
*  to talk to you and your people.
*  Well, thank you.
*  It's very gratifying to hear.
*  And I feel very blessed in no small part
*  because of our conversation today.
*  Thank you so much.
*  Nice, well, to be continued.
*  To be continued.
*  We'll do it again and again and again.
*  Thank you for joining me today for my discussion
*  with Dr. Sam Harris.
*  I hope you found it to be as enlightening as I did.
*  And be sure to check out the Waking Up app
*  that Dr. Sam Harris has made free

*  Not so much during today's episode,
*  but on many episodes of the Huberman Lab podcast,
*  we discuss supplements.
*  While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
*  many people derive tremendous benefit from them
*  for things like enhancing the depth and quality of sleep,
*  for enhancing focus and for hormone support,
*  and many other aspects of mental health,
*  physical health, and performance.
*  The Huberman Lab podcast is proud to announce
*  that we are now partnered with Momentous supplements
*  because Momentous supplements
*  are of the very highest quality.
*  They ship internationally
*  and they have single ingredient formulations,
*  which turns out to be important
*  if you're going to develop the most cost-effective
*  and biologically effective supplementation regimen.
*  If you'd like to access the supplements discussed
*  on the Huberman Lab podcast,
*  you can go to Live Momentous, spelled O-U-S,
*  so livemomentous.com slash Huberman.
