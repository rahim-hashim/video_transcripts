# Dr. Natalie Crawford: Female Hormone Health, Fertility & Vitality
**Andrew Huberman:** [November 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhlIkzJwPlk)
*  Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
*  where we discuss science
*  and science-based tools for everyday life.
*  I'm Andrew Huberman,
*  and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
*  at Stanford School of Medicine.
*  My guest today is Dr. Natalie Crawford.
*  Dr. Natalie Crawford is a medical doctor
*  specializing in obstetrics and gynecology,
*  reproductive endocrinology, and infertility.
*  She also holds a degree in nutrition science.
*  Dr. Crawford runs a clinical practice,
*  seeing patients daily,
*  as well as being actively involved in public education,
*  both through social media
*  and through her popular podcast entitled, As a Woman.
*  Today, Dr. Crawford teaches us about all aspects
*  of female hormones and hormone health and fertility,
*  beginning as far back as in utero,
*  when we were still in our mother's womb,
*  and extending as far forward as menopause.
*  We discuss topics such as the timing of puberty
*  and what the timing of puberty in girls means
*  for their fertility,
*  and we discuss birth control,
*  both hormonal and non-hormonal forms of birth control,
*  and how birth control may or may not
*  relate to long-term fertility
*  and different aspects of female health.
*  We also talk extensively about measuring fertility,
*  that is egg count.
*  We also talk about egg retrieval, AKA freezing one's eggs,
*  as well as in vitro fertilization.
*  And we also take a deep dive into the popular
*  and important topics of nutrition and supplementation
*  as they relate to fertility, as they relate to pregnancy,
*  but also how they relate
*  to female hormone health generally.
*  Indeed, Dr. Crawford provides us with a masterclass
*  on female hormones and fertility,
*  one that I know that all women ought to benefit from
*  and that men would benefit from listening to as well.
*  Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
*  is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
*  It is, however, part of my desire and effort
*  to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
*  and science-related tools to the general public.
*  In keeping with that theme,
*  I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
*  Our first sponsor is Maui Nui Venison.
*  Maui Nui Venison is the most nutrient-dense
*  and delicious red meat available.
*  I've spoken before on this podcast in solo episodes
*  and with guests about the need to get approximately
*  one gram of high quality protein per pound of body weight
*  each day for optimal nutrition.
*  Now, there are many different ways that one can do that,
*  but a key thing is to make sure that you're not doing that
*  by ingesting excessive calories.
*  Maui Nui Venison has the highest density
*  of quality protein per calorie,
*  and it achieves that in delicious things
*  like ground meats, venison steaks, jerky, and bone broth.
*  I particularly like the ground venison.
*  I make those into venison burgers
*  probably five times a week or more.
*  I also like the jerky for its convenience,
*  especially when I'm traveling
*  or I'm especially busy with work,
*  and know that I'm getting an extremely nutrient-dense,
*  high quality source of protein.
*  If you'd like to try Maui Nui Venison,
*  you can go to mauinuivenison.com slash Huberman
*  and get 20% off your first order.
*  Again, that's mauinuivenison.com slash Huberman
*  to get 20% off.
*  Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep.
*  Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows
*  that are tailored to your unique sleep needs.
*  Now, sleep is the foundation of mental health,
*  physical health, and performance.
*  When we are sleeping well and enough,
*  mental health, physical health, and performance
*  all stand to be at their best.
*  One of the key things to getting a great night's sleep
*  is to make sure that your mattress
*  is tailored to your unique sleep needs.
*  Helix Sleep has a brief two-minute quiz
*  that if you go to their website,
*  you take that quiz and answer questions
*  such as do you tend to sleep on your back,
*  your side of your stomach,
*  do you tend to run hot or cold in the middle of the night?
*  Maybe you don't know the answers to those questions,
*  and that's fine.
*  At the end of that two-minute quiz,
*  they will match you to a mattress
*  that's ideal for your sleep needs.
*  I sleep on the Dusk, a D-U-S-K, mattress,
*  and when I started sleeping on a Dusk mattress
*  about two years ago, my sleep immediately improved.
*  So if you're interested in upgrading your mattress,
*  go to helixsleep.com slash Huberman,
*  take their two-minute sleep quiz,
*  and they'll match you to a customized mattress for you,
*  and you'll get up to $350 off any mattress order
*  and two free pillows.
*  Again, if interested, go to helixsleep.com slash Huberman
*  for up to $350 off and two free pillows.
*  I'm pleased to announce that we will be hosting
*  four live events in Australia,
*  each of which is entitled the Brain-Body Contract,
*  during which I will share science and science-related tools
*  for mental health, physical health, and performance.
*  There will also be a live question and answer session.
*  We have limited tickets still available
*  for the event in Melbourne on February 10th,
*  as well as the event in Brisbane on February 24th.
*  Our event in Sydney at the Sydney Opera House
*  sold out very quickly, so as a consequence,
*  we've now scheduled a second event in Sydney
*  at the Aware Super Theater on February 18th.
*  To access tickets to any of these events,
*  you can go to hubermanlab.com slash events
*  and use the code Huberman at checkout.
*  I hope to see you there, and as always,
*  thank you for your interest in science.
*  And now for my discussion with Dr. Natalie Crawford.
*  Dr. Crawford, welcome.
*  Thank you so much for having me.
*  I'm honored to be here.
*  Well, I've been paying attention to your content
*  for a long time, and I find it to be incredibly clear,
*  informative, and for many people, actionable.
*  So today, I'd like to talk about both fertility
*  and, of course, hormones.
*  But as we both know, fertility is not limited
*  to a discussion about hormones.
*  It actually relates to things like behaviors,
*  sex behaviors, and other behaviors,
*  nutrition, supplementation.
*  So we'll get into all of it,
*  but if we could just back up developmentally
*  and talk a little bit about female puberty,
*  because I think pretty much everything we'll talk about today
*  is related to what happens puberty forward,
*  mostly in females, but we will also discuss
*  male fertility and hormones a bit.
*  And the question I have is,
*  is there anything about a woman's timing
*  or, let's just say, patterns of puberty, right?
*  How frequently they menstruate early on,
*  what the timing of menstruation is
*  in terms of their age, et cetera,
*  that provides hints or maybe even facts or directives
*  about her future fertility
*  or how long her fertility might last?
*  This is a great question,
*  and I think defining some terminology
*  before we begin is helpful.
*  So if we go all the way back
*  to when you're a fetus inside your mom,
*  so when there's a female fetus inside your mom,
*  you have the most eggs you're ever going to have
*  at about 20 weeks gestation.
*  You have about six to seven million eggs.
*  By the time you're born,
*  you've already lost more than half of those,
*  and you continually lose eggs all the time.
*  So the analogy that I always use and you do too
*  is imagining that there's a vault inside the ovary
*  where all your eggs are kept,
*  and every single month since the moment you have an ovary,
*  you lose a group of these eggs.
*  And when there's more inside, you're losing more.
*  So you're losing all of these eggs
*  throughout early fetal development
*  and then up until the time period even of puberty.
*  When you reach puberty,
*  you have a lessening of the number of eggs in your ovary
*  to the point where it can start to respond
*  to the signals from the brain.
*  So we think about puberty onset in females.
*  First, we have really theelarchy,
*  which is the development of breasts.
*  So that happens about two years on average
*  before you have minarchy, which is your period starting.
*  So what happens is the brain,
*  as we know from the hypothalamus, sends out GnRH,
*  and then we have FSH coming out,
*  which really starts to stimulate those follicles.
*  So FSH or follicle stimulating hormone,
*  well-named hormone for the female.
*  Of course, men have it too,
*  and it's less well-named for them.
*  But it starts to get those follicles
*  which house the eggs to grow and make estrogen.
*  Women have about two years of estrogen exposure alone,
*  so unopposed estrogen, with no progesterone
*  because they're not yet ovulating.
*  And that's when you start to see breast budding
*  and you start to see the development
*  of some of those secondary sex characteristics
*  before you actually have a period.
*  What are some of the other secondary sex characteristics
*  that precede minarchy?
*  So you said breast bud development
*  and then breast development on average
*  about two years before.
*  About two years before, you have sexual hair development.
*  So actually adrenarchy is one of the first,
*  usually comes right before at the same time with breast buds.
*  So two to three years before you'll see your period.
*  And then you- So genital hair,
*  underarm hair, typically. Exactly.
*  Yeah, genital hair usually first and then underarm hair.
*  And we're getting right down into the weeds here,
*  which is good.
*  A goal of this podcast is to normalize all aspects of health,
*  including sexual health and reproductive health.
*  Is that commensurate also with
*  the development of body odor?
*  Yes.
*  Because as a young boy who eventually hit puberty
*  and became a young man,
*  and now I suppose I'm in middle age, I'm 48,
*  I can tell you that the locker room
*  smelled a lot different before and after middle school.
*  Right? Right.
*  In other words, boys start to smell stinky.
*  They do, yes.
*  And that's usually around that same time
*  of sexual hair development,
*  is when you start to have those glands around the hair
*  making some of those odors that start to produce stink.
*  Do they reflect hormones themselves?
*  Not this, like the smell, the actual smell,
*  doesn't actually reflect levels of hormones
*  or anything like that.
*  It is just that your body, your gonads,
*  whether it is testes or ovaries,
*  are now starting to respond to those brain signals.
*  The brain is turned on, they're starting to respond,
*  and your body is starting to mature in a way
*  to get to the point where it can support reproduction.
*  The reason I ask that question
*  is not to get people thinking about stinky smells,
*  but, and by the way, some people love the musty smell
*  of their own armpits or others.
*  To each their own, to each their own.
*  We're referring to adults, by the way.
*  But the reason I ask is that there's a wealth of data
*  in animal models, including non-human primates,
*  suggesting that exposure to the odors of others
*  can either stimulate or accelerate puberty.
*  Is there any evidence for that in humans?
*  So there's mild evidence, and it's murky
*  because we also know that anything
*  that could be an endocrine disruptor,
*  which a lot of scents or fragrances are also,
*  can accelerate the onset of puberty
*  by disrupting part of this system.
*  And so we know that toxins and scents
*  and a lot of the world that we're exposed to
*  is part of the reason why we're seeing puberty
*  happening at such a younger age now in females specifically,
*  but in both, but in females than we have before.
*  We have young girls seeing their onset of menarche
*  or their period at a much younger age.
*  How much younger?
*  I've seen the various graphs for different countries,
*  but can we say that 10 years ago, on average,
*  girls in the United States and Northern Europe
*  were getting menarche at about, what, 12 to 13 years old?
*  Yeah, so we'll use menarche for the purpose of this.
*  So having your period, 10 to 20 years ago,
*  you will see most data would say,
*  oh, 13 to 15 would have been kind of the average age.
*  And now we're really seeing a shift
*  to be starting at 10 to 11 and completing by 13, 14.
*  So most girls are definitely going through
*  the puberty change earlier.
*  And the other thing to note is that
*  most girls get their final height growth
*  right before they start their period too.
*  So not only are we seeing a change
*  in this getting starting earlier,
*  what we're also seeing is probably some reduction in height
*  from having gone through puberty at an earlier process,
*  because once you start actually menstruating,
*  once the ovaries have really started to learn
*  how to respond to that FSH and grow the follicle,
*  and it gets to the point where you can start ovulating,
*  so about two years later, then that ovulatory period,
*  those high levels of estrogen are going to go
*  and they're going to close those growth plates.
*  So you've really started to limit your final adult height
*  as well when you go through puberty earlier.
*  And that's definitely something that's a huge concern
*  for precocious puberty or very young puberty, right?
*  And we can use blockers when there are children
*  who start to exhibit signs of puberty.
*  And one of the main reasons people do that
*  is to try to get them to a greater adult height
*  if they're really starting to go through puberty
*  at a very young age.
*  Is that also true for males?
*  That it's happening earlier?
*  That earlier puberty means that your growth spurt
*  in terms of height is going to be truncated.
*  Not the same.
*  And you probably, most men will say,
*  oh, but I had my growth spurt kind of after I started
*  having some of the puberty change that happened.
*  But because it is this estrogen-related process
*  and women that we see that growth spurt,
*  really your final height is within that year
*  of when your period starts.
*  Interesting, yeah, this discussion is certainly
*  not about me, but I was one of these,
*  what I thought was kind of an odd duck.
*  I hit puberty about 13, 14.
*  Let's just say I knew I did.
*  But I didn't shave until I was after college.
*  My growth spurt between freshman and sophomore year,
*  I grew a foot, right?
*  So I was like, I grew a full foot, but I was the same weight.
*  So I was like real tall, real skinny,
*  or pretty tall, real skinny.
*  And then it seems like some people in my life
*  would argue that puberty is still occurring for me.
*  But it feels like it's very long and protracted,
*  which leads me to a very specific question.
*  If puberty arrives, again, defined as menarche,
*  for sake of our discussion right now,
*  if puberty arrives early in a girl,
*  does that mean that her fertility
*  will shut down earlier as well?
*  Great question, it does not.
*  So the age of which you start the onset of your period
*  does not impact how long you're going to have
*  a reproductive lifespan.
*  And that's because you have the eggs inside that vault.
*  You're losing them every month, no matter what.
*  So you lost them all those years before your period started,
*  no matter if your period came at 10 or at 15.
*  It's just about when did they start allowing your body
*  to ovulate, determined by being able to carry a baby.
*  Your body now thinks you can be pregnant.
*  I think this is so important to highlight,
*  because it puts together what you said earlier
*  about the loss of eggs even as a fetus.
*  I think most people sort of assume
*  that the reduction in egg count is due to ovulation
*  and the fact that one egg ovulates typically,
*  but that other eggs are deployed in that ovulatory cycle.
*  And then those basically are taken out of the vault
*  and out of the opportunity for fertilization.
*  But what you're saying is that the eggs
*  are constantly being culled from the vault,
*  starting from early embryonic development.
*  And that ovulation is a distinct step,
*  in some sense, unrelated to the loss of eggs.
*  I think this is going to be very important
*  for our discussion later about potential egg harvest,
*  because I think some people have it in mind.
*  There's a lot of misconceptions
*  that you're losing eggs from your fault,
*  and that's not the case.
*  You're just accessing the ones outside.
*  So we can just answer this now, perhaps.
*  It seems, if I understand correctly,
*  that if one were to harvest eggs for IVF
*  or for embryogenesis in a dish to set them aside later
*  or freeze them for later, if they want to use them,
*  eggs or fertilized embryos,
*  that one is not reducing their total number of eggs
*  any more than they would
*  had they just let their cycles proceed naturally.
*  Exactly.
*  That's such an important point.
*  I think a lot of people believe the opposite.
*  It's probably the number one thing that patients fear
*  when they come talk to me about egg freezing
*  or going through IVF is,
*  I don't want to harm my future fertility.
*  I don't want to cause myself to run out of eggs earlier
*  or going to menopause earlier.
*  And it's explaining this process to them
*  that your ovaries are on a pathway that you can't change.
*  Those eggs are coming out of the vault,
*  regardless of if you're on birth control pills,
*  you're pregnant, we do IVF.
*  What we're modifying is one's not gonna ovulate
*  and have the rest of them die.
*  We're gonna try to give you medication
*  to get them all to grow,
*  so we can take all of the ones
*  that have been released from the vault that month
*  and give them a chance for later.
*  And the next month, you'll have another group come out.
*  So IVF is not about stimulating hyper release
*  or excessive release of eggs.
*  It's about stimulating the growth of the ones
*  that have been released so that they can be frozen at stage
*  either for later fertilization or fertilized in addition
*  than frozen as embryos.
*  Is that right?
*  Exactly.
*  And we just use the hormones that your body normally makes
*  in a different way.
*  The medications we use are FSH and LH
*  to get the eggs to grow.
*  So people will say,
*  I don't wanna take all these weird hormones
*  or strange medications,
*  but we're just manipulating that normal process
*  that happens in the natural menstrual cycle
*  in order to say,
*  hey, this month, let's get all these eggs to grow.
*  Let's try to improve the efficiency
*  of finding which eggs are going to be normal or not
*  and help you along this process.
*  I think a good number of people
*  are now going to head to the IVF clinic.
*  I think, again, I really wanna highlight this.
*  I think most people that I've spoken to
*  assume that the process of harvesting eggs
*  for freezing, for fertilization then,
*  or later is going to diminish their fertility
*  because they're basically pulling more
*  out of the savings account, so to speak.
*  Right.
*  Okay, so we-
*  You're making the withdrawal no matter what.
*  Great, well, such an important point
*  for people to know and propagate.
*  Getting back to puberty,
*  a little bit later on,
*  I wanted to get into endocrine disruptors
*  and things of that sort.
*  But since you brought it up,
*  I've heard things such as,
*  okay, things like evening primrose oil,
*  if mom is putting evening primrose oil on
*  or has it in her shampoo,
*  I've heard of young males
*  getting precocious breast bud development.
*  Keep in mind, folks,
*  that some transient breast bud development
*  is characteristic of some normal puberties in males.
*  It sometimes shows up and goes,
*  I knew some kids like that in the neighborhood.
*  They got teased a little bit
*  and then they stopped getting teased.
*  Hopefully nowadays they don't tease those kids.
*  But when I was growing up, those kids got teased.
*  Not by me, but by other people.
*  But it was normal and it passed for some.
*  It occurred normally and then passed.
*  But I've heard that things like
*  exposure to evening primrose oil,
*  maybe even just through contact with mom,
*  can increase the frequency or degree of that
*  male breast bud development.
*  Is it also true that young girls
*  can undergo precocious puberty
*  or let's just say,
*  accelerated or exacerbated puberty
*  through contact with things like evening primrose oil,
*  which I think has some pseudo estrogen-like properties?
*  It's important to differentiate
*  that the secondary sex characteristics we see,
*  like breast bud development, are from estrogen,
*  but it's not really puberty being initiated
*  when it's from an endocrine disrupting chemical.
*  So taking, being exposed to evening primrose
*  or lavender or tea tree oil in a male
*  isn't going to cause them to start to go into puberty,
*  but it is going to expose him to estrogen
*  when his body is not
*  and therefore stimulate some breast bud development.
*  Same thing can happen in young girls,
*  meaning they could show some of those secondary sex signs
*  earlier than they normally would.
*  And this is why,
*  if that's happening at a really young age,
*  kids should go to a pediatric endocrinologist
*  who are gonna check things like bone age
*  and see if you've really started the puberty process or not,
*  or is it an outside exposure, which is causing it.
*  Interestingly about the young child exposure and development,
*  the other thing to say that's really interesting
*  and relevant in my field
*  is that when we think about how many eggs are in the vault
*  and everybody's born with this different number,
*  and I'm sure we'll talk about ovarian reserve,
*  what we now know is that the vault,
*  your ovaries are most susceptible
*  to whatever your mother does when she's pregnant with you.
*  And that that epigenetic, that programming,
*  which is happening, is predisposing young women
*  to probably having some of them low ovarian reserve,
*  some of them having diseases we associate with infertility
*  like PCOS or endometriosis.
*  And we haven't yet characterized what all they are,
*  but if we look at the incidence of some of these disease
*  that we see now, what we do know is that the time period
*  of which these people were pregnant,
*  the 80s and 90s, was not the healthiest time
*  when it comes to endocrine disruptors
*  and plastic exposures and chemicals
*  and all of this processed stuff,
*  let's just say that people have been exposed to,
*  that we're really seeing that ovarian susceptibility
*  to egg quality and quantity
*  happens in that fetal development period.
*  It's interesting because there's some parallels
*  to male fetal development,
*  like the fact that you have these early organizing effects
*  of hormones like dihydrocystosterone,
*  which essentially stimulate the growth of the penis,
*  but also then establish a propensity
*  for hormones during puberty
*  to activate growth of the sex organs,
*  but also activate the brain areas that are responsible
*  for a host of different things.
*  So I only mentioned that because what I'd like
*  to kind of illustrate in the background here
*  is that basically our reproductive health begins,
*  really prior to conception, really,
*  it's dependent on mom and dad,
*  but certainly to a great degree on mom,
*  but then fetal development is going to be important.
*  So sort of us being able to pick our parents,
*  I do have a couple of questions about lavender,
*  tea tree oil and evening primrose oil.
*  I was aware that evening primrose oil, excuse me,
*  can somehow bind estrogen receptors
*  or mimic some of the estradiol or something similar to it.
*  I wasn't aware of tea tree oil or lavender.
*  Here are we talking about oils?
*  What about aromas?
*  And how concerned do people have to be about this stuff?
*  Because I mean, you'll go into a restaurant bathroom,
*  there'll be potpourri, some people wear perfume.
*  I mean, we don't want to set a paranoia,
*  but I think people should know about this stuff.
*  Tea tree oil is in a lot of those natural shampoos,
*  the ones that burn.
*  Yes, the one that tingle your scalp.
*  Yeah, I don't like those.
*  Some people love them though.
*  Constant exposure is very different
*  than a one-time hand washing in the bathroom.
*  And I think that's the big difference for everything
*  when we talk about chemicals or toxins
*  or exposures in the world.
*  You can't live in a toxin-free world.
*  But choosing what you put in and on your body
*  on a regular basis does set the tone
*  for certain physiologic changes.
*  And so using unscented products, especially with children,
*  is a really important thing because we want to make sure
*  that their lifetime exposure to some of these things,
*  especially during critical times, is much less.
*  And so you'll see people recommend things
*  like your laundry detergent,
*  what's sensor in your laundry detergent.
*  The shampoo and conditioner are a big one.
*  And the soaps that you use on a day-to-day basis
*  in your house or the oils you put on your body.
*  Lavender is huge because there's this whole community
*  of people, they want to rub lavender oil
*  on their baby's feet and help them sleep.
*  But really we can see, and if somebody goes
*  and shadows a pediatric endocrinologist for a day,
*  they'll see some kids come in
*  and this will be the reason why.
*  What about cloth diapers versus non-cloth diapers?
*  I've heard that you have your very strong
*  cloth-dryer proponents, right?
*  And that because they seem to feel or believe
*  that non-cloth diapers somehow contain things
*  that can get into baby's skin.
*  And maybe there's a bigger question here.
*  Is baby skin more permeable than adult skin?
*  I guess I don't know that baby skin is more permeable
*  or not. I don't either.
*  To me it seems like it'd be hard to imagine it is,
*  but babies do seem to have this incredible skin, right?
*  Their skin is so smooth.
*  It's very soft.
*  And you want to squeeze their cheeks
*  and all this kind of stuff.
*  But yeah, the idea that it would be more permeable.
*  I think it's more that their development is,
*  this time is very important and setting the stage
*  for a lot of what happens later.
*  Versus in adulthood,
*  those stepwise developmental processes have already happened.
*  So I think that's why we pay so much attention
*  to what happens in the childhood period of time,
*  because we're now learning about those later consequences
*  of what you're exposed to.
*  It's not that regular diapers versus cloth,
*  whatever we want to say,
*  one's necessarily better than the other.
*  It's more honestly a personal preference.
*  Babies are exposed to them a lot.
*  And there's been a lot of attention to that,
*  but similarly somebody could use cloth
*  and wash it with a detergent
*  that then has certain chemicals in it.
*  So there hasn't been a study shown
*  that this one thing is an exposure for a baby
*  that somebody needs to be worried about.
*  There's definitely companies now which are promoting
*  and talking about traditional diapers
*  that they are making sure have less toxins in them.
*  And I always think anytime you can decrease
*  toxin exposure to a child is going to be very important.
*  Is there any evidence for breast milk versus formula
*  in terms of impact on future reproductive development
*  or reproductive status of a child?
*  That's a complicated question because breast milk exposure,
*  at least for the first six months of a child's life,
*  certainly helps with the immune system development.
*  And we know that poor immune development can lead
*  to higher risk of autoimmune disease later,
*  what people call leaky gut.
*  And some of those diseases certainly
*  are correlated with fertility.
*  I wouldn't say we've gone so far to say
*  that if you don't breastfeed your child,
*  they're going to have fertility issues,
*  but we do know that there's an in-between correlation
*  with things that breastfeeding is protective against
*  and how those diseases themselves may relate to fertility
*  in the female later on.
*  Okay, so if we're thinking about a young girl slash woman,
*  because we're talking about puberty, right?
*  So I don't know what the exact nomenclature is there.
*  My experience is I'll offend somebody no matter what.
*  But a girl who undergoes puberty, right?
*  So a young woman who's maybe 13 or so,
*  so she's early teens, undergoes puberty
*  and therefore is continuing to lose eggs from the vault,
*  but now is undergoing presumably
*  roughly every 28 days, menarche.
*  But let's talk about this 28 days thing,
*  because I think a lot of people think that
*  quote unquote normal menstruation is always 28 days.
*  And we know that's not true.
*  So what is the range of normal durations
*  between menstruation cycles
*  or duration of the menstruation cycle?
*  And let's also define when the menstruation cycle starts,
*  probably for the males mostly in the audience, right?
*  Sure, sure.
*  So let's think through the cycle.
*  We'll do a quick one over and then answer the questions.
*  So what we think of as cycle day one,
*  or when you're going to say this starts,
*  is gonna be the day that you start bleeding.
*  So that's actually shedding the endometrial lining
*  from what grew the last time.
*  So any spotting even would be considered day one?
*  Okay.
*  So it is, we can get back to it, but there's problematic.
*  If you have a lot of spotting before that full flow starts,
*  a day or so can be really normal,
*  just as the body's adjusting to the drop in progesterone.
*  But let's just start at the beginning.
*  Day one, you have a period of menses.
*  This is when you're actually bleeding.
*  At this time period, we like to think about
*  all of those new eggs being out of the vault,
*  being susceptible to that FSH,
*  which of course is that well-named hormone,
*  because it stimulates the follicle to grow
*  and each egg is in a follicle.
*  That egg starts to grow and makes estrogen.
*  That estrogen stimulates the proliferation
*  of the lining of the uterus in preparation
*  for potentially that pregnancy that may come.
*  And also that estrogen makes you feel really great, right?
*  That's the follicular phase,
*  named so because that follicle is growing
*  and it's an FSH dominant phase
*  where you have a lot of estrogen.
*  And people feel great when they have a lot of estrogen.
*  Yeah, women feel good with estrogen.
*  Because of the relationship between estrogen
*  and other neuromodulators like dopamine and serotonin.
*  And is that happening in parallel
*  or are they somehow related?
*  Like is estrogen controlling the release of serotonin
*  somehow and vice versa?
*  Or are they just kind of coincidentally
*  happening in parallel?
*  We definitely think that there's more of a correlation
*  causation than just coincidence,
*  because we know there's time periods
*  where people are more depressed within your cycle,
*  correlating with those low estrogen levels.
*  And we know that when you go into menopause
*  or you run out of eggs
*  and you're now in a low estrogen phase,
*  we see a lot more of a depressed mood
*  and you know, anhedonia, lack of response to things
*  which would normally give you pleasure
*  happens more frequently.
*  The female brain loves estrogen
*  and it's protective against things like dementia.
*  So this is a time period
*  where women are going to be more energetic,
*  they're gonna have more energy, more focus.
*  This is the estrogen dominant phase of the cycle.
*  And when you have seen that estrogen at its high levels
*  which it's only made from a mature follicle
*  and it's very specific, 200 picograms per milliliter
*  for 50 hours, that's the brain's clue.
*  Okay, we must have a mature egg
*  and it can send out that surge of LH or luteinizing hormone.
*  And now you ovulate.
*  And when you ovulate, the follicle opens up,
*  releases, closes back, and then it's the corpus luteum
*  and we've entered the luteal phase.
*  And the corpus luteum as the name suggests,
*  a corpus, it's like a body that's basically the-
*  It's fatty body, yeah.
*  It's basically the corpse of what-
*  It's the dead follicle, yes.
*  Yeah, then sheathed the egg before.
*  And what I find so amazing, I mean, biology is so beautiful.
*  Instead of just taking that tissue and saying,
*  okay, like let's just discard this
*  or that becomes the trigger for the next phase of the-
*  It is essential for life, right?
*  The corpus luteum which makes progesterone
*  opens and closes the implantation window.
*  It is what allows somebody to get pregnant
*  and for our species to continue.
*  And so it's extremely fascinating.
*  And that corpus luteum gets stimulated
*  to produce progesterone impulses
*  throughout the entire luteal phase
*  because it's still controlled by the brain
*  unless you get pregnant.
*  And then in that luteal phase, progesterone is fascinating.
*  It's trying to protect you from things
*  which could potentially harm your baby.
*  So suddenly now you have less energy,
*  you wanna sleep more, you wanna eat more,
*  you maybe do not wanna have sex as much
*  because your body is suddenly saying,
*  let's just protect this potential implantation
*  that you're going to have.
*  If that pregnancy doesn't come,
*  the corpus luteum can only live 12 to 14 days.
*  It has a very distinct lifespan.
*  And then it dies, your estrogen and progesterone both drop,
*  you bleed starting over the next cycle
*  and a new group of follicles comes out to be released.
*  And the reason why walking through that very succinctly
*  but is important when you're asking
*  how long is the normal cycle?
*  Because the luteal phase is pretty set at 12 to 14 days.
*  The follicular phase can vary in person to person.
*  And what we know though is for one individual,
*  if your menstrual cycle,
*  your reproductive hormones are working right,
*  it should be relatively constant for you.
*  And so if your periods are every 24 days,
*  but they've always been every 24 to 25 days,
*  then that's not concerning.
*  And if your periods are every 33 days,
*  but they've always been every 33 days,
*  then that's not concerning.
*  But we do get concerned
*  when there's a change in your period
*  or we get concerned when people have
*  what I like to say is irregularly regular periods.
*  Because what you'll see textbooks tell you
*  is that your periods could be as short as 21 days,
*  as long as 35 days, and that can all be normal.
*  But people will hop between them.
*  And they'll have one cycle that is 24 days in length
*  from day one to the last day before the next day one.
*  Then the next cycle is 32, and then it's 26,
*  and then it's 34, and that's not normal.
*  That's too irregular.
*  And that can be a sign
*  that something is not communicating correctly
*  within your reproductive hormones.
*  So what I tell patients is, in general,
*  your period should be less than 35 days apart,
*  and you should be able to look at a calendar
*  and with your finger, put a finger on the date,
*  and within a couple days of accuracy,
*  be able to predict when your period's coming.
*  And if you can't, there could likely be something
*  that is interfering with the hormonal signals
*  between the brain and the ovary.
*  And one of the biggest, really one of the only things
*  we see as women start to have fewer eggs in the vault
*  is a shortening of their cycles.
*  So you have a regular period, and suddenly now,
*  you have less eggs in the vault,
*  so less are coming out each month.
*  And when the brain sends out that FSH signal,
*  now there's fewer eggs, so it's not getting as dilute,
*  and you have one starting to respond sooner.
*  So suddenly, you're ovulating shorter, faster in your cycle.
*  You're ovulating on cycle date nine instead of 14.
*  Your luteal phase is still set,
*  but the person who comes to see me and says,
*  my periods have always been 28 to 30 days,
*  but now they're every 24.
*  I just figure it's no big deal.
*  I have red flags going off everywhere
*  because I'm now really concerned
*  that potentially their ovarian reserve has dropped
*  to a point where we are starting to see clinical changes.
*  Now, of course, things like thyroid and prolactin
*  and other hormones can also cause such changes,
*  but that's why you'll hear most
*  reproductive endocrinologists say
*  your period's a vital sign.
*  And what we really mean is the regularity at which it comes
*  and the predictability of it is telling us
*  if your hormones are all communicating in a normal fashion
*  or if something could potentially be off.
*  As we all know, quality nutrition influences,
*  of course, our physical health,
*  but also our mental health and our cognitive functioning,
*  our memory, our ability to learn new things and to focus.
*  And we know that one of the most important features
*  of high quality nutrition is making sure
*  that we get enough vitamins and minerals
*  from high quality, unprocessed or minimally processed sources
*  as well as enough probiotics and prebiotics and fiber
*  to support basically all the cellular functions in our body,
*  including the gut microbiome.
*  Now, I, like most everybody,
*  try to get optimal nutrition from whole foods,
*  ideally mostly from minimally processed or non-processed foods.
*  However, one of the challenges that I
*  and so many other people face
*  is getting enough servings of high quality fruits
*  and vegetables per day, as well as fiber and probiotics
*  that often accompany those fruits and vegetables.
*  That's why way back in 2012,
*  long before I ever had a podcast, I started drinking AG1.
*  And so I'm delighted that AG1
*  is sponsoring the Huberman Lab podcast.
*  The reason I started taking AG1
*  and the reason I still drink AG1 once or twice a day
*  is that it provides all of my foundational nutritional needs.
*  That is, it provides insurance that I get the proper amounts
*  of those vitamins, minerals, probiotics and fiber
*  to ensure optimal mental health,
*  physical health and performance.
*  If you'd like to try AG1,
*  you can go to drinkag1.com slash Huberman
*  to claim a special offer.
*  They're giving away five free travel packs
*  plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
*  Again, that's drinkag1.com slash Huberman
*  to claim that special offer.
*  Let me see if I have this correct.
*  We've got this thing that we call the menstrual cycle,
*  the ovulatory cycle.
*  There's two phases, a follicular phase and a luteal phase.
*  Follicular precedes the luteal phase.
*  The luteal phase tends to be, if I heard correctly,
*  fairly fixed, about 14 days.
*  The follicular phase can vary in duration,
*  maybe 10 to 14 days, maybe even 10 to 18 days,
*  depending on something about their brain
*  to ovary communication.
*  For those that aren't familiar with this,
*  I always learned that estrogen primes progesterone.
*  That's kind of the really basic top contour description
*  of the ovulatory cycle.
*  That estrogen is gonna slowly climb
*  toward the point of ovulation,
*  and then there's a peak and then a drop,
*  and then progesterone is going to dominate
*  in the luteal phase, the second half.
*  You said that estrogen is associated
*  with a psychological level and a physiological level.
*  More energy, feelings of vitality,
*  some of that estrogen increase is actually coming
*  from the one egg that got stimulated the most,
*  the one that got selected, so it's picked for the team,
*  potentially for the team, but got picked,
*  potentially for fertilization,
*  and that egg sheds its corpus luteum,
*  which is this piece of the egg
*  that then triggers the progesterone
*  that dominates the luteal phase.
*  Do I have that right?
*  Mostly, mostly.
*  Okay, yeah, please correct me where I'm wrong.
*  The follicle in which the egg grows,
*  when you ovulate, it ruptures.
*  The cyst bursts.
*  A follicle is a cyst, a cyst is a fluid-filled structure,
*  follicle is a fluid-filled structure that holds an egg.
*  So when you ovulate and you get that LH surge,
*  the cyst bursts, it opens up, and the egg comes out of it,
*  and then it re-heals and becomes the corpus luteum.
*  Got it.
*  So just a little bit different in timing.
*  And you're right with estrogen primes progesterone,
*  but really, we think about it the layer of the uterus,
*  because estrogen stimulates the growth of that lining,
*  and then progesterone stabilizes it
*  and allows implantation to occur.
*  But the sequence of events of when you're estrogen dominant
*  and progesterone deficient, which is the follicular phase,
*  and people will come in having labs drawn randomly
*  and they're all concerned
*  that they don't have progesterone.
*  And when you talk to them about where they are
*  in their cycle, you say,
*  you're not supposed to have progesterone.
*  That's your follicular phase.
*  This is perfectly normal.
*  Okay, great.
*  Thanks for that clarification.
*  I get a lot of questions about birth control,
*  but on my social media handles.
*  Don't we all, don't we all?
*  To be clear.
*  It's a vast topic for exploration,
*  but along the lines of what we're talking about now,
*  I've heard, and I suspect it may not be true, but tell me,
*  is there any evidence that taking birth control
*  can disrupt the process that you just described?
*  And when we talk about birth control,
*  we should probably define what we're talking about.
*  So there are hormone-based birth controls, aka the pill.
*  There are also hormone-based birth controls
*  that are not in pill form.
*  There are IUDs that are copper IUDs, there are other IUDs.
*  Let's just talk about hormone-based contraception
*  in females.
*  Okay.
*  If, which many of them, as I understand,
*  are estrogen mimics or estrogen themselves
*  that suppress ovulation,
*  do they diminish or increase the number of eggs
*  that are taken from the vault?
*  Fantastic question.
*  Let's talk about what people say is the pill.
*  So let's specifically talk about combined oral contraception,
*  the pill which has ethanol, estradiol,
*  and some type of progestin.
*  No, contraception does not change the release of eggs
*  out of the vault.
*  They are occurring at the same process and the same pathway.
*  You're not ovulating because that estrogen does prevent FSH
*  from coming from the brain.
*  So you have the group of eggs still come out of the vault.
*  There's no FSH.
*  They just all die.
*  The next group comes out.
*  So when you are saying,
*  are you gonna run out of eggs faster?
*  Is it gonna harm your fertility?
*  Does birth control impair the process?
*  The answer is no.
*  But there's a couple of important caveats.
*  One is that the birth control pills,
*  especially if you take them continuously
*  or for a prolonged period of time,
*  the body's smart and the ovaries start to say,
*  well, we're not really doing anything.
*  And one of those markers of ovarian reserve we have
*  is AMH and that's anti-mullerian hormone.
*  And AMH is made from the granulosa cells
*  or the cells that surround every follicle.
*  So in the shortest way possible, more eggs in the vault,
*  more come out every month, higher AMH.
*  Fewer eggs in the vault, fewer come out, lower AMH.
*  If your AMH is being suppressed
*  because of the birth control pill,
*  because it's decreasing the activity
*  of those granulosa cells,
*  you might get a low AMH value
*  when you've been on the birth control pill for a long time.
*  That is completely reversible.
*  But it can be significant.
*  So if somebody is wanting to get an AMH level,
*  let's say somebody comes to my clinic,
*  they're not trying to get pregnant and they're on the pill
*  and they're considering freezing their eggs,
*  so we're going to check their ovarian reserve.
*  If we draw it, I always say this,
*  AMH may be up to 30% lower
*  in somebody who is on the birth control pill.
*  So we can still draw it.
*  And if it comes back in the normal range, we feel good.
*  But if it does come back low,
*  we're going to have to make a decision.
*  Are we going to stop the birth control pill
*  for a period of some months,
*  use alternative contraception
*  if you don't want to be pregnant,
*  and then repeat this test to see if this is a true low,
*  because we do see that young women
*  do have low ovarian reserve sometimes,
*  or was this just suppressed
*  because you were on the birth control pill?
*  So we see it impact some of the hormone testing
*  that we can do,
*  and I think that's an important distinction.
*  And we can see that the longer you take it,
*  that potentially it might actually improve your fertility
*  if you had underlying endometriosis
*  or some medical conditions
*  that we see associated with infertility.
*  So prolonged pill users can potentially
*  improve their fertility versus people
*  who are trying to get pregnant that same age
*  who were not on the pill.
*  Those studies are complicated, right,
*  because of selection bias,
*  because if you've been on the pill for 10 years,
*  you're a little bit older,
*  so is it that they were preventing pregnancy
*  and the other group potentially had some exposure,
*  so they were inherently more infertile
*  than the group that was on the pill?
*  But we do know that the pill doesn't cause infertility,
*  and I use it all the time.
*  All the time in IVF cycles,
*  we put people on the birth control pill
*  because we can actually synchronize that group of eggs
*  that comes out of the vault to grow together,
*  because your body doesn't want to have 20 babies
*  at one time, right?
*  And what we're trying to do with IVF,
*  get 20 eggs to grow if that's what's out of the vault,
*  really goes against the check and balance
*  of the human body to not have 20 babies at once.
*  Why is it that males who take testosterone,
*  synthetic testosterone,
*  it shuts down their own testosterone production
*  and sperm production,
*  but females who take estrogen
*  in the form of birth control pills,
*  it doesn't shut down estrogen production by the ovaries?
*  So I love this question, you know the answer,
*  so I like it extra because I know you're asking.
*  Spermatogenesis is a constant and ongoing process, right?
*  So in women, you're born with all the eggs
*  you're ever going to have,
*  and what we're talking about is if we stop FSH
*  at that moment,
*  we're just impacting the ability to ovulate at that time,
*  but we're not changing this constant loss
*  throughout the vault.
*  Spermatogenesis, right?
*  The sperm is made every single day,
*  you're making brand new sperm.
*  So 72 days for the sperm to be created
*  on the testes and 18 days to find their way
*  out the ejaculatory system.
*  And so exposures that you have
*  that stop the production of FSH and LH
*  inhibit the development, the creation of new sperm.
*  So somebody who's been on testosterone
*  will tell the brain,
*  the brain doesn't know it's from your taking it,
*  it says, hey, we have plenty of sperm, we're good,
*  we don't need any more.
*  So the brain then gets suppressed
*  and doesn't make that FSH and LH,
*  therefore not stimulating both
*  further testosterone production,
*  because you don't need that,
*  but testosterone production and sperm production
*  go hand in hand.
*  So therefore you're no longer making new sperm.
*  And in fact, the longer you're on testosterone,
*  the harder it may be to get sperm production to come back,
*  and in 25% of people, they may not get it back
*  if they've been on prolonged testosterone exposure.
*  So it's really because of what women will sometimes say
*  is unfair, which is the fact that you're born
*  with all these eggs and you run out of them.
*  They accumulate the wear and tear of your life, right?
*  We see egg quality being a huge issue
*  in female reproduction,
*  yet men get to have new sperm every 90 days.
*  They get to wash away whatever bad deeds they did
*  and can change their lifestyle and their exposures
*  and have very different sperm.
*  But because of that same process,
*  things that shut off the production of FSH, LH
*  really impact sperm quite significantly.
*  You mentioned bad deeds for sperm, not by sperm,
*  I said for sperm.
*  And we know that heat is a pretty traumatic insult
*  to the spermatogenesis cycle, saunas and hot tubs
*  and whatnot.
*  I did receive the question as to whether or not
*  heat exposure, saunas, hot tubs, et cetera,
*  are they detrimental to ovulation
*  or egg production in any way?
*  Obviously things are more internal in females,
*  the ovaries are internal,
*  but is there any evidence for that?
*  The body does heat up.
*  It doesn't harm the ovulatory period or the ovaries.
*  Just like we know,
*  the reason why the testes are so susceptible
*  is because they're supposed to be at a cooler temperature.
*  That's why they're in the scrotum outside the body.
*  That's why the testes are so susceptible to heat changes.
*  But the ovaries being inside the body,
*  they're not in the same way.
*  Now, when somebody's pregnant, important distinction,
*  we know that the development,
*  especially organ development of an embryo
*  can be more sensitive to certain things
*  and that heat exposure at that time,
*  whether it's hot tub use or extreme fevers
*  even can make a difference in development of a fetus.
*  But when it's coming to the ovulatory cycle
*  or hormone production,
*  heat in the female doesn't make any difference.
*  I wanna be clear before I ask the next question
*  that I don't wanna be responsible
*  for any unwanted pregnancies.
*  But when I was in high school,
*  they told us that women can get pregnant
*  even while they have their period.
*  Is that true?
*  It seems like a lie based on everything you're saying,
*  but I don't want anyone to run out
*  and test that hypothesis without having the facts first.
*  So in general, if somebody has extremely regular cycles,
*  then that's a complete lie.
*  You can't get pregnant on your period.
*  The reason why they tell us this is one,
*  especially when you're younger,
*  your period cycles tend to be irregular.
*  Your body hasn't fully matured to have that regularity
*  and that we know that sperm do live
*  in the reproductive tract for much longer than the egg does.
*  So sperm can live there for up to five days.
*  So if somebody did have a shorter period window,
*  let's say their normal periods are going to be 24 days,
*  they're ovulating on cycle day 10.
*  If they have a regular period that's five or six days,
*  they could potentially have intercourse
*  that end part of that period.
*  The sperm could live for five days and be right there
*  when you have the egg in route.
*  So it's not the most fertile time for sure.
*  And in most people that is considered a time
*  when you're not going to get pregnant,
*  but especially when you're younger
*  and you have more irregularity
*  or in people who have a short cycle window,
*  that might not be the case.
*  So by extension, can we conclude then
*  that the most fertile time is going to be
*  when sperm meets egg,
*  let's save timing of intercourse for the time being,
*  but because there can be a delay there.
*  When sperm meets egg on obviously day of ovulation
*  or day after.
*  Day of.
*  Day of.
*  The egg lives for 24 hours.
*  So the egg can only be fertilized for 24 hours
*  while it's in the fallopian tube.
*  Once the egg has entered the uterus,
*  it can't be fertilized anymore.
*  So it has this very short window of time
*  where it will allow sperm to enter it.
*  Now sperm can live for five days.
*  So we'll say the fertile window is this five day period
*  ending on the day of ovulation.
*  You will hear a lot of us, a lot of doctors say
*  the day after ovulation,
*  because do you really know exactly what time
*  you ovulated on?
*  And if the egg has 24 hours,
*  then that extra day could potentially be helpful.
*  But really it's five days ending on the day of ovulation.
*  And people with very regular cycles
*  or who can track them and they know
*  when that ovulation is happening,
*  the day before and the day of ovulation,
*  those are the two top hitting days.
*  So if you're kind of not in the mood to have lots of sex,
*  those are gonna be the days you target
*  to have the highest chance of conceiving.
*  And what is the relationship between estrogen,
*  libido and ovulation in females?
*  The higher your estrogen is,
*  the increased libido that you're going to have.
*  And of course you see those peak estrogen levels
*  which are going to trigger that LH surge.
*  So the body is made to get pregnant.
*  You're going to have that peak estrogen,
*  that peak libido right before
*  and right at that ovulatory time period
*  so that hopefully you also want to have intercourse
*  and get pregnant.
*  I've heard before, let's just say,
*  that some people, be careful here,
*  can sense the, literally the deployment of the ovulation.
*  They report that they can feel
*  let's just say the departure of the egg.
*  Is that an imaginary thing?
*  No, no, that's very real.
*  I always liked that image
*  that people can know when that happens.
*  It's so real, it has a name.
*  After all, men generally know
*  when their sperm are leaving their body,
*  let's hope they do.
*  But why wouldn't there be an internal sense
*  for women also of what's going on?
*  I mean, we have interoception,
*  there's a ton of nerve innervation of that area.
*  It doesn't communicate to the brain,
*  excellent as far as tracking to where that sensation is.
*  But you're right.
*  I already said ovulation is the rupture of a cyst, right?
*  It is rupturing and the egg is being released
*  and those follicular fluid is also exiting
*  and going into the peritoneal cavity.
*  And so there is a group of women who can feel that,
*  especially people who are very in tune with their body
*  and it has a name, it's called middleschmerz.
*  The pain almost feels like a crampy pain
*  that happens in the middle of the cycle
*  and that is your ovulatory pain.
*  How interesting, what is it called?
*  Middleschmerz.
*  Okay, we'll put that in the show note captions
*  and whoever does it is gonna have to get the spelling right.
*  Middleschmerz, amazing, amazing.
*  Amazing and foreign to me, but for obvious reasons,
*  but amazing.
*  I'm always astonished in how incredibly well orchestration
*  this whole process is.
*  It's just an incredible feat of biology.
*  I mean, the number of things that have to be timed correctly
*  and the use and I don't wanna say reuse,
*  but the repurposing of tissues for different things.
*  Like what an incredible dance, that's just amazing.
*  It's beautiful.
*  I mean, I'm so nerdy because I just love
*  how everything has to communicate just perfectly.
*  It makes you in awe of all the pregnancies
*  that just happen just all the time,
*  because really things have to synchronize
*  really at the wonderful time period.
*  And even though this isn't what we're talking about,
*  I've heard you say this, so I wanna say this.
*  People always ask every single day,
*  well, how much sex should you have?
*  When should you have sex?
*  Is there too much sex?
*  And what we know is that you definitely should not decrease
*  your sexual intercourse interval.
*  So if you are in a relationship
*  and you are sex everyday people, have sex everyday,
*  you will 100% hit intercourse
*  throughout your entire fertile window
*  on the day that you ovulate.
*  You're depositing the same sperm there
*  because you're not generating new sperm.
*  It's whether the load went half and half and half and half,
*  or if it went in one big group.
*  But if you're constantly putting more sperm out there,
*  you have a higher chance.
*  And so studies go back and always say,
*  daily intercourse, as I say,
*  with the highest chance of fecundity,
*  especially during the fertile window.
*  However, for couples who are not sex everyday people,
*  that idea can cause a lot of stress.
*  Stress, of course, impacts the system
*  in a lot of different ways.
*  It can also cause sexual burnout
*  where they no longer feel like being intimate
*  or having sex on the day they're actually ovulating
*  because they've been doing it this whole time leading up.
*  And that's where the time period of saying,
*  have sex every other day throughout the fertile window,
*  so starting five or six days
*  before you think you're going to ovulate,
*  and then try to target having intercourse
*  the day before and the day of ovulation.
*  And the reason why people said,
*  every other day or a few days prior
*  to kind of get some sperm exposure there
*  in case you ovulated early,
*  but really to try to prevent some of that increased stress
*  that can happen when you're trying to conceive,
*  especially if you have programmed or timed intercourse
*  that needs to happen on an everyday interval.
*  But the odds of getting pregnant
*  by saving up sperm for two or three days, that's not higher.
*  Curious then why if let's just say hypothetically,
*  someone is donating or freezing sperm or doing IVF,
*  why they instruct the male to not ejaculate
*  for 48 to 72 hours prior to,
*  let's just say depositing sperm, it's such a funny word.
*  It is.
*  But it works, so.
*  Two points.
*  One, if we're doing a semen analysis,
*  now we're trying to evaluate the sperm,
*  and any test has certain normal parameters,
*  and these are all based on a 48 to 72 hour abstinence period.
*  So yes, if you ejaculate more frequently,
*  you're going to have less sperm,
*  and that can be very normal,
*  but if we're looking at a test with set normal parameters
*  that are based on two to three days
*  of not having intercourse,
*  that's why we want you to do it for that.
*  If we're doing, let's say, IUI,
*  or intrauterine insemination,
*  also known as artificial insemination,
*  or where we take the sperm and put it in a catheter
*  and put it in the uterus,
*  we're trying to get more players further down the field,
*  and in that case, I know when you ovulate
*  because I'm timing it perfectly,
*  and I am trying to get as many possible in this process,
*  because we're not just having them deposited in the vagina,
*  we're trying to get them further.
*  So we want more because that's part of that treatment process.
*  And similarly with IVF,
*  I want to have as many sperm as possible to sort through
*  and pick out the best-looking, the most modal,
*  the most normally shaped ones.
*  So we're trying to get just a better sample,
*  and by having these normal guidelines,
*  we're able to judge this is low for what it should be,
*  which can also be a clue to other problems.
*  I definitely want to talk about chemistry,
*  both sort of interpersonal chemistry
*  and literally ejaculate and vaginal chemistry.
*  But before we do that,
*  I'm curious whether or not we can just touch on
*  a few of the things that a lot of people wonder about
*  in terms of egg quality.
*  And if they touch on sperm quality,
*  maybe we can also just mention that.
*  But for instance,
*  does cannabis either by edible or by smoking cannabis
*  impact egg quality in either direction?
*  Alcohol would be the next.
*  And then I'm going to assume, and I have to do this
*  strictly because of what I understand about
*  drugs of abuse like cocaine and amphetamine,
*  that none of those can be good for systems of the body
*  because they create so much stress for the body.
*  But let's just say alcohol and cannabis.
*  I read a statistic when researching the episode on cannabis
*  that shocked me, which is that 15%,
*  one 5%, not 1.5, 15% of American women,
*  at least in this one study, survey,
*  reported having consumed or smoked cannabis
*  during known pregnancy, which is wild.
*  Wild.
*  Unless of course, I'm just naive
*  and THC is not harmful to the fetus,
*  but I have a hard time believing that.
*  So what gives?
*  I mean, and there I actually just threw in fetal development.
*  So is cannabis, is alcohol bad for egg quality?
*  So there are different things
*  and they're the same thing in one.
*  So let's answer them each individually.
*  So we'll go with the one that everybody knows
*  and has accepted now that they wouldn't have accepted
*  40 years ago, right?
*  Smoking cigarettes.
*  So that's obviously bad.
*  Decreases the number of eggs you have in the vault.
*  Smoking cigarettes actually gets into your vault,
*  decreases the number that you have.
*  You have a higher chance of going into menopause earlier
*  and it increases the risk of having abnormal chromosomes,
*  which is what we really think about
*  when we think about egg quality, right?
*  Impacting those myotic spindles inside the eggs,
*  which hold the chromosomes in their perfect position.
*  They are associated, they get wear and tear
*  from things that cause inflammation or are toxic.
*  So cigarette smoke, we know decreases egg quality,
*  egg quantity, increases miscarriage,
*  and then of course has fetal impacts.
*  Could I just ask you, when we talk about,
*  there's nicotine, which itself is not carcinogenic,
*  and then there's the smoking process,
*  which brings in a bunch of other things.
*  The question I know is burning in everybody's mind
*  is vaping, right?
*  Because vaping is, I'm very bullish on this.
*  I mean, it's very clear that the chemicals associated
*  with vaping are just, oh, so bad for everybody's health,
*  but it's distinctly different from saying
*  that nicotine is bad for one's health.
*  And it can be, but without doing too much of a deep dive,
*  are there any data that show that vaping is bad
*  for egg quality?
*  Of course there's not as much data
*  because it just hasn't been around as long, but yes,
*  vaping definitely has chemicals that looks like
*  it's associated with poor success rates in IVF cycles.
*  And that's really kind of one of the most finite measures
*  of egg quality we can see,
*  because we're really testing the egg at a level in a lab
*  versus just, are you getting pregnant naturally?
*  And sorry to interject again,
*  but anytime a conversation like this comes up,
*  especially between two people in the health science space,
*  there are these shouts, because I hear them literally,
*  where people say, well, listen, I've vaped every day,
*  and I've had three healthy babies.
*  And I think that my response is always,
*  okay, there's gonna be a distribution of responses.
*  And then of course, how much healthier
*  could your babies have been,
*  had you not vaped during pregnancy
*  or vaped prior to pregnancy?
*  I mean, I think these are the key issues
*  that you can't rewind the clock, as far as I know,
*  in the absence of a time machine,
*  you can't rewind the clock.
*  So, I mean, basically everything you're saying
*  is that smoking cigarettes or vaping nicotine
*  just can't be good for egg quality.
*  We know that.
*  We know that it's not good for getting pregnant.
*  We know that it's not good for sperm.
*  And therefore, we also know it's going to impact
*  pregnancy rates, things like cannabis, right?
*  Decreases sperm production, decreases sperm motility,
*  changes sperm morphology, the shape of it,
*  changes the DNA, increases the fragmentation of the DNA.
*  If your partner uses cannabis and you get pregnant,
*  you have a higher chance of miscarriage
*  because of the sperm association with the cannabis.
*  I don't know, right?
*  Because you can't study something that's illegal.
*  So a lot of this data is just more new
*  and a lot of it's going to be observational.
*  And in states like Colorado and California
*  where, you know, cannabis is essentially legal,
*  I'm assuming there are more data, but okay.
*  So smoking and or vaping nicotine,
*  cannabis, either edible or smoked,
*  very likely detrimental to egg quality and sperm quality,
*  which is not to say that one can't conceive.
*  It just means that the quality of your baby,
*  your child will not be as high as the quality of that baby
*  if you didn't do that.
*  Is that right?
*  And I'm not trying to demonize anyone
*  that did do this during pregnancy.
*  A lot of people didn't know,
*  but this is really about people trying to make choices
*  in anticipation of future pregnancy.
*  Yeah, and when you're trying to set yourself up for success
*  because we know infertility is becoming more common,
*  we don't always know who is going to have it.
*  And when you find yourself in that position,
*  specifically, you now want to optimize everything you can.
*  So if there's something that is going to make
*  the sperm quality worse and the egg quality worse
*  and your success with treatment lower
*  and your miscarriage rate higher,
*  we're going to recommend that you not do it.
*  If you're trying to get pregnant naturally,
*  all these things correlate over.
*  But of course, there's always going to be outliers
*  and exceptions.
*  I'm going to sit here and tell you
*  that the odds of getting pregnant at age 43
*  are less than 3% per month.
*  And every single person is going to be like,
*  but my Aunt Barbara, or I know this person who did,
*  because 3% is not zero.
*  And you're talking about natural pregnancy there by intercourse?
*  Old fashioned way, yes.
*  Right, but yes.
*  So people will get pregnant.
*  People will have healthy children who do have exposures
*  to nicotine, to cannabis, even to alcohol,
*  even though we know that alcohol
*  can cause fetal alcohol syndrome.
*  0% of alcohol should be the acceptable level in pregnancy.
*  And then does alcohol impact fertility?
*  Such a complicated question.
*  And this is probably due to the amount you consume
*  and the frequency of which you consume it.
*  Alcohol is a toxin that your liver must filter out.
*  And we know it causes inflammation.
*  Anybody who's had a fun night with alcohol
*  knows they can wake up the next day and they feel different.
*  Their body is processing that alcohol.
*  And that inflammation, especially if it's chronic,
*  chronic exposure, we know chronic inflammation
*  is one of the things that we see
*  impacting egg quality and sperm quality.
*  So certainly if you enjoy alcohol,
*  it should be something that is done in moderation,
*  one or two drinks a week at the most.
*  And you should not do it at all
*  once you find out you're pregnant.
*  I'd like to take a quick break
*  and thank our sponsor, InsideTracker.
*  InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
*  that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
*  to help you better understand your body
*  and help you reach your health goals.
*  I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
*  for the simple reason that many of the factors
*  that impact your immediate and long-term health
*  can only be assessed with a quality blood test.
*  The problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests out there,
*  however, is that they'll give you information
*  about certain lipid markers or hormone markers,
*  but no information about what to do with all of that data.
*  InsideTracker makes it very easy to look at your levels
*  of hormones, metabolic factors, lipids, et cetera,
*  and then to assess what sorts of behavioral,
*  nutritional, supplementation,
*  or perhaps other interventions you might want to use
*  in order to bring those numbers into the ranges
*  that are optimal for your health.
*  InsideTracker's ultimate plan
*  now includes three new hormone markers
*  that are critical to measure
*  during a woman's reproductive and menopausal years.
*  These are estradiol, progesterone,
*  and thyroid stimulating hormone.

*  When we were talking about birth control,
*  I unfortunately moved us forward
*  and forgot to ask about IUDs.
*  Oh yeah.
*  So my understanding is that the copper IUD works
*  by creating a sort of, not actually electric,
*  but a kind of a electric fence that kills sperm.
*  Sperm don't like copper.
*  Yeah, I love that one.
*  Sperm don't like copper.
*  Likes to kill sperm.
*  There's some interesting history.
*  I've been reading a lot on the history of medicine
*  of people who, for whatever reason,
*  were forced into or chose to be in the sex trade,
*  prostitutes using, inserting copper coins
*  into their vaginal tract to try and kill sperm,
*  but to varying degrees of success.
*  Obviously there's a whole socioeconomic landscape
*  around that, so I think it's obvious
*  what I'm referring to, but very interesting.
*  But that's just one form of IUD.
*  There are some other IUDs,
*  and then there's of course the ring.
*  We didn't talk about that,
*  so maybe we could just touch on a few of those
*  within the context of whether or not it alters egg quality
*  and or future fertility when one takes the ring out,
*  takes the IUD out.
*  This is a great question
*  because a lot of people don't know this,
*  and I'll roll through a few of the top birth control methods
*  and just thinking through.
*  Copper IUD, as you already said, no hormonal involvement.
*  It causes inflammation in a toxic environment
*  inside the uterus, isolated,
*  does cause sometimes heavier periods,
*  but they should still be regular.
*  If they are irregular, that's a sign of a hormonal issue
*  because you still ovulate with the copper IUD.
*  Is it literally a copper wire woven into the tissue
*  of the uterus? Yeah, woven.
*  So the IUD is a little T,
*  and the arms have copper wires wrapped around them.
*  And those grow into the uterine lining?
*  They don't grow into the uterine lining.
*  The IUD just sits in there,
*  and just the presence of that copper
*  causes that inflammatory reaction
*  in that toxic environment.
*  And is it toxic to the environment
*  in ways that are detrimental to the woman or just to sperm?
*  Both.
*  I mean, implantation is not going to occur, likely.
*  I mean, nothing is 100% successful,
*  but it's much harder for an embryo to implant
*  within that highly inflammatory environment.
*  To me, amazing that people figured this out
*  before the advent of laboratories.
*  Right?
*  Let's just put some copper in some uteruses
*  and see what happens.
*  It really speaks to the urgency
*  that must have existed to preventing pregnancy
*  and just how costly biologically and financially pregnancy is.
*  And pregnancy is not health neutral.
*  So it is something that somebody needs to be
*  of right health or it can be a deadly circumstance.
*  When we get back to other IUDs,
*  so IUDs that more people are more familiar with
*  are the progesterone-based IUDs.
*  This is going to be your Mirena, Kailena, Laylara.
*  They have a bunch of different names
*  based on the amount of progesterone
*  and how long they last for.
*  These work mostly by thinning out the uterine lining.
*  As we already said, progesterone
*  compacts the uterine lining to prepare it for implantation
*  in a normal cycle.
*  But if you have constant exposure to progesterone,
*  what is going to happen is it's going to prevent
*  the uterine lining from growing
*  and it gets it very, very thin.
*  Not all IUDs, in fact, most of them don't prevent ovulation,
*  only in about 50% of people
*  do they actually prevent ovulation.
*  So their main mechanism of action
*  is this endometrial effect.
*  When you remove the IUD,
*  especially if you're already ovulating, no problem.
*  The problem we do see in some people with progesterone IUDs
*  that maybe isn't talked about as much
*  is that this prolonged progesterone exposure,
*  because people are putting IUDs in for five to seven years
*  and not having a period for that length of time
*  because the endometrium has become so atrophic
*  or non-existent that you're no longer bleeding
*  despite the fact that you may be ovulating.
*  It can take a while for that lining to grow back.
*  And so it's not uncommon to have an IUD in place
*  and if you have no period, you're going to say,
*  this is great, I don't have a period, wonderful.
*  You get it removed and now your period hasn't come back.
*  And that leads people to sometimes be concerned
*  that the IUD is causing them not to ovulate
*  or they have this infertility caused by the IUD.
*  But really what it is is that the linings become so,
*  so thin that it can take many months
*  of that unopposed estrogen exposure in the follicular phase
*  to get it thick enough to finally bleed
*  when you're ovulating.
*  So I do tell people if they have a progesterone IUD
*  to get it removed three to six months
*  before they wanna get pregnant,
*  use some other form of contraception,
*  but give their body time to make sure
*  they have that regular period pattern back.
*  Important distinction, if you're still ovulating
*  and having a period on an IUD,
*  then this is gonna be less of a concern
*  because if you're growing enough of a lining
*  to then shed it, we're less worried about it.
*  But if you are amenorrheic or have absence of your periods
*  with an IUD, we need to think about removing it
*  for a period of time before you get pregnant
*  so that your body can grow that lining again.
*  When it comes to some of the other things
*  that you mentioned, one you didn't ask
*  that I wanna mention is the DepoProvera shot.
*  The DepoProvera shot is a high dose of progesterone,
*  high enough to actually prevent ovulation.
*  So in that circumstance, you are not ovulating
*  and therefore if you don't ovulate,
*  you're not going to get pregnant.
*  DepoProvera is proven to prevent ovulation for three months.
*  So when you take it, you need to get it every three months
*  to have a proven contraceptive benefit.
*  However, it can last in your system for 18 months
*  and prevent ovulation for up to 18 months.
*  So I will see people who liked that option for contraception
*  and now they haven't had a period in a long time
*  but their last depo shot was six months ago
*  and they're all frustrated by the fact when I tell them,
*  well, you still may not have another period for a year plus
*  because this high level of progesterone
*  that you've already injected into your system
*  can last a substantial amount of time.
*  So that is a contraceptive option
*  that I tell people to discontinue a year and a half
*  to two years before they wanna get pregnant,
*  which sometimes people don't know that yet.
*  And so that's something that can be a contraceptive option
*  if you're very remote from wanting to have a child.
*  But in people who are in their childbearing years
*  contemplating family building soon,
*  that is not my favorite option.
*  So you haven't mentioned, because I haven't asked,
*  any negative consequences of birth control of any kind.
*  And I'm not encouraging you to,
*  if you don't believe in them,
*  I know that this is a very controversial topic
*  but one of the more popular studies discussed
*  on social media is one that I've spent some time
*  with the paper and a few of the papers that stemmed from it.
*  Not a huge study, but describing that how women rate
*  the faces of men as either more,
*  essentially what happens is there seems to be,
*  at least in this study,
*  there was a statistically significant bias
*  for women to select particular male faces as attractive.
*  And those male faces tended to be of the more square jaw,
*  AKA masculine features, in air quotes.
*  This is what the study found.
*  But that when women were on oral contraception,
*  presumably estrogen progestin type oral contraception,
*  that effect was smeared.
*  They had not a statistically significant tendency
*  to choose the quote unquote more masculine face.
*  So I have to be very careful with my language here
*  because it's easy to get description
*  of a study like this wrong.
*  And that has led a lot of people to think
*  that birth control is gonna throw off their partner choice.
*  Now, of course, it's a small study.
*  Studies like it are not always so well controlled.
*  But is there any evidence that birth control,
*  oral estrogen progestin-based birth control,
*  just to keep it specific, can increase rates of cancers,
*  can decrease rates of cancers,
*  can lead to any sorts of disruptions
*  in bodily function or health
*  that's really like a rock-solid result,
*  that's been seen by multiple studies, clinical trials,
*  or are we still just in the dark about a lot of this stuff?
*  Okay, so nothing is without risk.
*  Getting pregnant is not without risk.
*  Taking the birth control pill is not without risk.
*  We do see that there's been a lot of not informed consent
*  in people who are taking the birth control pill,
*  meaning maybe they weren't educated
*  about what all of their options were,
*  the positives and the negatives about each one of them.
*  If we're gonna reference the convo to the pill,
*  estrogen progesterone pill,
*  important to understand that neither the estrogen
*  nor the progesterone are the same estrogen progesterone
*  that your ovaries make, right?
*  It's ethanol estradiol,
*  which your brain interprets as an estrogen,
*  but other parts of your body may not.
*  And then it's various types of progestins,
*  some of which have even androgenic
*  or male hormone-like properties,
*  and some of which do not.
*  So there's a ton of variation,
*  even the amount of ethanol estradiol that each pill has
*  with your low, low and your low pills having less,
*  and even with the modern day average pill
*  having a lot less estrogen than it used to.
*  When you're on the birth control pill,
*  your ovaries aren't making estradiol,
*  and that estradiol is important
*  in growing the uterine lining,
*  but also for the genital structures.
*  And so we think about vaginal health and bulvar health.
*  We certainly see that especially with continuous use.
*  So if we distinguish, you take the pill for 21 days
*  and you have a seven-day break where you might bleed,
*  or you take sugar pills and then you take them again,
*  a lot of people now are taking continuously
*  where you have exposure to these compounds every single day.
*  So in like the wheel, the little pouch with the wheel
*  of different colored pills,
*  they've seen these on the countertop
*  in previous relationships.
*  And then there's the ones that sometimes people
*  just opt not to take because those are the,
*  not the placebo, they're the sugar pills.
*  There's no need to take estrogen during that phase.
*  And then they repeat.
*  Is that? Exactly.
*  Okay, but some people are taking estrogen
*  all the way around the dial. Continuously.
*  It's very common right now.
*  So people, and they're not wrong, they say,
*  oh, well, why have a period in these little breaks?
*  It's not really a reflection of my hormone status,
*  which is accurate.
*  And so they're taking them continuously.
*  You also have less pill failure pregnancies.
*  So if you're using the pill for contraception,
*  that can be a great strategy.
*  But the longer you take them,
*  we do see some vaginal and vulvar changes, right?
*  And so atrophic vaginitis,
*  people who notice increased sensitivity,
*  decreased elasticity, increased discomfort with intercourse,
*  increase in like yeast infections,
*  that can sometimes be seen
*  because that environment is different.
*  Now that's just one thing that can come from the pill.
*  We also see the pill be lifesaving for other people.
*  They have terrible, you know, PMS
*  or premenstrual dysphoric syndrome,
*  where their mental health,
*  when they change from high to low estrogen,
*  it's always the change in estrogen that interferes,
*  can cause them people to really have mental health issues
*  that are so severe,
*  that having that stable hormone level is helpful.
*  And so the pill can be extremely beneficial for some people
*  when it comes to mental health.
*  It can be beneficial for people who have issues
*  with very heavy periods and anemia.
*  Instead of getting blood transfusions,
*  you know, taking the birth control pill
*  might prevent the lining of the uterus
*  from growing so much that they bleed so much.
*  Same thing with fibroids, people with PCOS.
*  PCOS is polycystic ovarian syndrome.
*  If we want to put it very simply,
*  you have a lot of eggs in your vault.
*  So you release a lot of eggs every month.
*  And what this does is the FSH signal gets diluted.
*  And so you're not responding to the normal signal
*  and you don't ovulate.
*  And because the ovary is a hormone making factory,
*  it gets really bored when it can't make estrogen
*  because that egg's not growing.
*  So it starts to make testosterone.
*  So you start to see this androgen dominant environment
*  associated with lack of ovulation
*  and having a lot of follicles inside the ovary
*  that are not really responding.
*  And the androgenization of other tissues
*  like body hair, deepening of voice.
*  Yeah, body hair.
*  Typically the level of testosterone made in PCOS
*  isn't truly deepening voice.
*  It can if there is an ovarian tumor making testosterone
*  or certain other conditions.
*  But typically with PCOS, you see increase in body hair,
*  increase in acne, and you can see some even like
*  male pattern balding, some temporal balding of women.
*  So some hair loss.
*  Temporal balding.
*  So like the widow's peaking?
*  Yeah, the widow peaking and then thinning out
*  in these two areas.
*  And then we see an increase in body composition
*  toward the male level.
*  So if we think about a male body holding your fat
*  in your abdominal region,
*  and if we think about the traditional female body
*  holding more fat in the hips and thighs area,
*  we see that when this hormone shifts in PCOS,
*  you tend to get more abdominal fat distribution
*  which then leads to further insulin resistance
*  and metabolic syndrome.
*  But in PCOS, because you're not ovulating
*  and those ovaries, each little follicle
*  makes a tiny amount of estrogen.
*  We'll say each little follicle when it's not responding
*  will make one to two picograms of estrogen.
*  But if you have 50 of them each month,
*  you're having some constant estrogen exposure.
*  So that lining of the uterus is being constantly
*  stimulated to grow, and you're never getting
*  the progesterone to stabilize
*  or the progesterone withdrawal to bleed.
*  So endometrial cancer is much higher in people with PCOS
*  who don't ovulate and the birth control pill
*  can prevent that.
*  Any unopposed estrogen situation,
*  because the body is made to have both estrogen
*  and progesterone.
*  So we see an immense decrease in endometrial cancer,
*  an immense drop in ovarian cancer.
*  Ovarian cancer comes from the remodeling of the ovary.
*  So every time you have a follicle grow and it ruptures
*  and it makes the corpus luteum and then it heals up,
*  those are opportunities for those cancer cells
*  to go away in that remodeling process
*  and lead to ovarian cancer.
*  And because you're not ovulating on the pill,
*  your incidence of ovarian cancer drops dramatically.
*  10 years of pill use has dropped the chance
*  you get ovarian cancer by more than 90%.
*  And of course, ovarian cancer is super hard to diagnose
*  because the innervation to the peritoneal system is poor
*  and you don't have any outward signs
*  often to late stage disease.
*  That being said, could you potentially have an increase
*  in breast cancer in some people?
*  By taking the pill?
*  By taking the pill.
*  That's a concern, especially in people
*  who might be predisposed to this for some other reason.
*  They might have BRCA mutations or something like that.
*  And then is there a situation where the pill
*  certainly masks what's going on with your menstrual cycle?
*  And I really think this is where women's health
*  has a huge history in paternalism,
*  meaning doctors will just tell people
*  this is what you're going to do.
*  So your periods are irregular,
*  here is the birth control pill.
*  And they're not explaining why or the pros and cons to it.
*  And what happens is people are not being taught
*  how their bodies work and now they are
*  because of your podcast amongst others.
*  And now they're able to know that my periods are vital sign
*  and I don't know what it is
*  because the pill is producing a different environment.
*  The pill has also been associated
*  with potentially development of things like leaky gut or IBS.
*  And so there is a definite change in your environment
*  when you're on the birth control pill.
*  And then there's also a huge increase in the risk
*  of increased risk of blood clots
*  because of how it's processed in the liver
*  increasing your clotting factors.
*  Can I just interrupt there?
*  I'm aware that a fairly high percentage of people
*  have mutations in factor V Leiden, a clotting factor.
*  Fewer people are, as we say, homozygous,
*  have two deficient copies, mutant copies I should say.
*  But there are many people out there
*  who have contraception in females
*  can really exacerbate the factor V Leiden mutation.
*  Do you suggest that people get their factor V Leiden
*  genetics analyzed?
*  I mean, it's pretty inexpensive to do, right?
*  I think on a standard blood test,
*  you can just ask for the factor V analysis
*  and it's not like a really in-depth thing.
*  You don't have to fly to some of the-
*  Yeah, it's a blood test.
*  Yeah, you don't have to fly to another country
*  like you do for many things.
*  It's important to say that's not the norm, right?
*  That's not the recommendation.
*  When you're talking about putting somebody
*  on the birth control pill,
*  you wanna make sure they don't have high blood pressure
*  because it can increase their blood pressure.
*  You wanna make sure they don't smoke cigarettes
*  because the combination of the pill and cigarette smoking
*  can increase the risk of a stroke.
*  But the recommendation is not to screen them
*  to see if they have any inherited clotting disorders.
*  That said, if you ever have a blood clot
*  on the birth control pill,
*  because you're traveling on a plane
*  or you're just on the pill or you're living your life,
*  you're now gonna get this extensive workup
*  to find out if you do have that.
*  It's by no means wrong and specifically you should,
*  if anybody in your family has ever had a DVT,
*  so a deep vein thrombosis, so a blood clot in their leg,
*  or a pulmonary embolism or a PE.
*  So anybody in your family has had one of those,
*  you should 100% get worked up for clotting disorders.
*  And if you have something like it, you carry factor five,
*  you should no longer take the birth control pill.
*  And specifically the pill, because it's an oral pill
*  and how it's metabolized in the liver
*  is actually what is causing the change
*  in those clotting factors
*  because that's where they're made as well.
*  So it doesn't mean you can't take any form of contraception,
*  but we do wanna make sure that we counsel you appropriately.
*  I never think it's wrong to be an advocate
*  for your own health or to ask questions.
*  It's important to know that screening,
*  I mean, I'll get on my soapbox
*  because we'll talk about screening for ovarian reserve
*  and it is 100% not recommended
*  even though I think it should be.
*  My next question is gonna be about testing AMH levels
*  and we'll return to that for those that hear that
*  and it sounds cryptic as well as getting an ultrasound,
*  just seeing basically how many eggs are likely
*  to be in the vault on both sides.
*  Okay, so we have to remember
*  that screening recommendations come from
*  at what point in the population does it make sense
*  to spend the money to test for a disease
*  based on the likelihood of finding it.
*  So if we think about, right,
*  your pap smear guidelines and your colonoscopy
*  and your mammograms, everything is all based on
*  when are you going to find enough cases at some age
*  to make it worthwhile testing,
*  which is a crazy principle, especially in the US
*  because the government's not paying for our healthcare,
*  so why should these guidelines be based
*  on when is it cost effective to do testing?
*  Well, I'll put in,
*  this is gonna sound a little bit conspiratorial,
*  but it's not, I mean, I think that given that
*  for people who have insurance, private paid insurance,
*  or through their work,
*  that there's a cost to doing these tests
*  of any kind, colonoscopy, AMH, et cetera,
*  and they must have figured out the optimal point
*  on the graph with which they can reduce their payout
*  to people who, for instance, get colon cancer
*  if they didn't get the colonoscopy at 45,
*  as opposed to 50, as opposed to 60, as opposed to 25.
*  I mean, the reality we know is that
*  the more information you have,
*  the better choices you can make.
*  I mean, the only caveat to that would be
*  that for some, not all, but for some people,
*  sort of the hypochondriatic type,
*  sometimes more information leads to more anxiety,
*  which leads to more problems, but that's a rare instance.
*  That is, I always think that in general,
*  data is always good.
*  I agree.
*  Having the information at hand about your body
*  and being able to make educated choices
*  versus being in a position where you say,
*  I had no idea that I had factor five light in,
*  and I had this terrible blood clot,
*  because pulmonary embolisms can kill people.
*  We all know that, right?
*  So we talk about this rare thing, but it can happen.
*  But this is really where it can be tough.
*  It can be tough to find even a doctor who made,
*  like we said, factor five is a blood test
*  and relatively inexpensive, so that one is not hard,
*  but physicians live in a weird world
*  where they have recommendations based on screening,
*  based on the likelihood of finding disease that they follow,
*  and when they go off of those,
*  they start introducing themselves
*  to why are you not following medical guidelines?
*  But for an individual,
*  this is really tough to advocate for yourself.
*  And the one thing that I'll say too,
*  this is why paying attention to your body is so important,
*  understanding your stool habits and what's normal
*  and what's not so that you can catch early signs of things
*  and present for that colonoscopy earlier.
*  The current screening guideline
*  for should you get your ovarian reserve checked
*  is that you should not.
*  ACOG, the American College of OB-GYN,
*  has an entire practice bulletin situation saying,
*  there's no utility and screening for AMH.
*  Okay, I totally disagree, but okay.
*  I'm glad you disagree.
*  I mean, to me, it just seems nuts.
*  Okay.
*  Or ovaries rather.
*  I mean, the AMH is a blood draw.
*  AMH is a blood test.
*  It's a blood draw.
*  One could opt to do the ultrasound as well,
*  which is of course more invasive,
*  but women who are seeing their OB-GYN
*  are probably familiar with pelvic exams.
*  Yeah, I mean, it's a vaginal ultrasound,
*  but it's not painful.
*  Not painful, but different than a blood draw,
*  just for in full disclosure.
*  And I've heard of women in their early 30s
*  going in, getting their AMH levels checked,
*  getting their ultrasound done,
*  and then going, oh my goodness, they're down to like,
*  I don't want to throw out numbers
*  because this actually can get tricky.
*  They'll say, oh, you have whatever, four follicles,
*  and then someone in their early 40s will have 20 follicles,
*  and then people start to,
*  it sort of becomes a scorekeeping thing.
*  And of course, follicle quality,
*  there are a bunch of other things,
*  and then you can tell us more about those.
*  But let's say someone did not have insurance
*  or insurance permission to get this paid for.
*  What is the approximate cost
*  of getting one's AMH levels analyzed?
*  $79.
*  $79 to find out essentially
*  where your ovarian reserve is at.
*  So let's talk about this.
*  I already said this in my soapbox.
*  So ACOG says you shouldn't screen it
*  because AMH does not predict your fecundity, right?
*  Your body's ability to get pregnant in that month
*  is independent of your AMH.
*  And for the most part, that's true, right?
*  Because let's say you have a person
*  and they're both 30, you have two people.
*  One has low ovarian reserves.
*  They have five eggs coming out of the vault.
*  And this one has normal ovarian reserve,
*  and they have 20 eggs coming out of the vault.
*  And we should probably clarify that the number of,
*  because you said this earlier,
*  but the number of eggs coming out of the vault
*  is an indirect measure of how many eggs is in the vault.
*  When that number is going down,
*  it means the number of eggs in the vault
*  is likely going down as well.
*  Sort of like your body starts to take smaller withdrawals
*  as you start to run out of.
*  The vault wants to be at equilibrium, right?
*  It really wants to be in this middle ground.
*  So when you have too many, it shoots out more every month.
*  It's too crowded, it doesn't want that.
*  And then when it starts to get low,
*  it gets scared about being empty
*  and sends out fewer per month.
*  So what you see outside the vault,
*  and that is called an antral follicle count, or an AFC.
*  It's an ultrasound-based measurement
*  of how many eggs you have outside the vault
*  at one point in time.
*  And on the ultrasound, if one looks,
*  this is gonna show up as, so it'll look like
*  little hollow spaces, like so not gray stuff,
*  but hollow bodies.
*  I say chocolate chips and the chocolate chip cookie.
*  If we can imagine the over-
*  Beautiful image, yeah.
*  Yeah, like looks like a chocolate chip cookie,
*  the chocolate chips, small little dark fluid-filled follicles.
*  Each one of those houses an egg.
*  Some bigger than others
*  because they're more mature than others.
*  Based on when you check in the cycle.
*  So if you're looking in that early follicular phase
*  when somebody's on their period,
*  they all should be small because nothing's been stimulated.
*  If I'm looking periobulatory,
*  I'll see that dominant follicle that's about to ovulate,
*  and then everything else will be small.
*  And is there a graph that people can look at
*  or that we could link to that says,
*  okay, the average with a distribution of,
*  you know, standard error on either side
*  for let's say a 28 year old woman or a 37 year old woman
*  or a 45 year old woman of the number of follicles
*  on the right and left side.
*  And as I understand asymmetries are common.
*  Yeah.
*  Tends to be, you know, like if someone goes in
*  and you got six follicles on the left side
*  and 12 on the other side, are they,
*  how do people gauge where they're at?
*  Fantastic points.
*  One, because their doctor should tell them
*  but that doesn't always happen.
*  But yes, we add these counts together
*  to get your antral follicle count
*  because there is often asymmetry.
*  But what we should expect, let's say in somebody who's 30,
*  is you should have in the 16 to 20 range
*  of total follicles per month.
*  Right and left side combined.
*  Combined, okay.
*  When you're 35, that number is closer to like 14 to 16.
*  So starting to drop, it's still pretty good.
*  When you're 40, it's eight to 10.
*  When you're 44, two to four, right?
*  So you start to have this immense drop
*  that exponentially starts to increase really around age 37.
*  So things start to kind of get into this severe zone
*  really after age 37.
*  And we didn't really talk about ages 18 to 25
*  but there are people who get pregnant in that age bracket.
*  Are, is the follicle count very, very high?
*  Is there sort of a nonlinear drop off or?
*  Yeah, their follicle count would be higher.
*  And I mean, I occasionally have patients who are very young
*  but have infertility or want to freeze their eggs.
*  I've also had patients in that age range
*  who are in premature ovarian failure, right?
*  Because there can be things that go wrong even early.
*  But we should probably highlight again
*  something that you said earlier, but gosh, I, you know,
*  this like contradicts so much of what's out there
*  which is that even if you have low follicle count,
*  if you collect eggs, you're not changing
*  what's in the vault.
*  You're not pulling from the vault.
*  You can't.
*  Right, those eggs are spent.
*  You now have the opportunity to turn them
*  into potential pregnancies.
*  Correct, I mean, side note, right?
*  We haven't even dove into IVF,
*  but that's the next wave of technology
*  is what we call IVM and vitro maturation.
*  People are trying to figure out how can you get eggs
*  from the vault and get them to grow in the lab
*  because that would open up possibilities
*  for people who have fewer eggs
*  to have a higher efficiency of this process.
*  Because one of the limiting factors
*  when you're doing fertility,
*  when you're doing egg freezing or IVF
*  is how many eggs can you get per month?
*  And that's why some people have to do cycle after cycle
*  because they can only get five eggs or five eggs.
*  But if we circle back to what we were saying
*  when we got off on this beautiful tangent
*  is that no matter if you have five
*  or you have 20 eggs outside the vault,
*  you're ovulating one.
*  So you're trying to get pregnant naturally.
*  That's what fecundability is,
*  probability of getting pregnant per month naturally.
*  You have the same chance if you're the same age,
*  regardless of if you have five eggs or you have 20 eggs.
*  And that's why ACOG came in and said,
*  well, AMH doesn't impact fecundability.
*  It doesn't predict your ability to get pregnant
*  or who's gonna have infertility
*  and who's not gonna have infertility.
*  So there's no utility and screening for it in people.
*  Now.
*  For once, I'm speechless.
*  I mean, that argument makes sense through the lens
*  of just probabilities of pregnancy,
*  through natural conception,
*  but it completely erases the very, very, very real situation
*  where people are making choices about, for instance,
*  whether or not to stay with a given partner,
*  whether or not to leave a given partner,
*  whether or not to accelerate the process
*  of building a family.
*  Should I raise my eggs?
*  Should I have a baby now?
*  Oh my goodness, there's so many factors
*  that this American College of whoever, whoever
*  is like completely psychologically diverse.
*  OB-GYN, they're a big deal, but they're crazy.
*  And that's what I say.
*  They argue in their statement
*  that finding that you have, I'm like,
*  no, I'm reeling it in.
*  I mean, I'm trying to think of an analogy that doesn't fail,
*  but it's like if you can, it's just like saying,
*  okay, if you can walk now, great,
*  there's no reason to test for this inevitable paralysis
*  that's going to happen at different rates
*  in different people.
*  And there are things that you can do to offset it.
*  In other words, you could like take a little bit
*  of some tissue that will allow you to walk in the future,
*  but we're not gonna do that because if you can walk now,
*  you can walk now. It's good now.
*  That's absurd.
*  And that's really what it is.
*  And they say, well, finding out that you have low ovarian
*  reserve at a young age is going to cause undue stress
*  that is unwarranted because most people
*  don't have infertility.
*  And so they're purely putting it through the lens
*  of your likelihood to get pregnant.
*  But it's actionable stress.
*  Exactly.
*  Like if it was just stress, like, hey, guess what?
*  And you know, I know people who have family members
*  with Huntington's mutations and some opt to not know
*  whether or not they themselves have
*  the Huntington's mutation.
*  And it's a very personal choice, right?
*  But here, whereas unfortunately there still isn't a cure
*  for Huntington's, hopefully someday there will be,
*  Malcolm would, but in the meantime,
*  there is essentially a cure for this situation,
*  which is the harvest and potential fertilization.
*  At least an opportunity.
*  And this is what I say.
*  And of course you and I feel similarly.
*  Education and data, like being the one to make the choice
*  is an extremely important distinction
*  versus having it happen to you.
*  So if you're young and you find out you have
*  a low ovarian reserve, is that gonna make a difference?
*  And it very well might.
*  You might now freeze your eggs
*  when you wouldn't have otherwise.
*  You might now start to try to get pregnant
*  if you're partnered when you otherwise were just waiting.
*  But now you know.
*  It might change the conversation with your partner too.
*  Right?
*  Because a lot of people think they can just wait.
*  I know you'd be like, oh.
*  Because of age, right?
*  We're in our 30s.
*  I'm only 30, I can totally wait.
*  But if you have a low ovarian reserve,
*  then you may lose the opportunity for parenthood.
*  And for a lot of people, this is a life goal.
*  And this is what's wild to me.
*  When on earth, besides reproduction,
*  do we have life goals that we take the approach,
*  I'll just wait and see if it's a problem later?
*  Never, right?
*  If you wanna become a doctor, you wanna become an athlete,
*  you are constantly working towards that goal
*  or understanding what it's going to take to get there.
*  But why does the goal of parenthood,
*  the attitude is completely,
*  I'm not going to think about it until later.
*  And then I'll deal with it if it becomes a problem.
*  Because you can make choices.
*  You could freeze your eggs.
*  You could try to get pregnant sooner.
*  You could evaluate for reasons of low ovarian reserve.
*  Do you have a genetic mutation or an autoimmune disease?
*  Why is it low?
*  It's not just always a big unknown.
*  There can be some actual things
*  that potentially might be impactful
*  for your health long term.
*  So I think it's wild that this is the current conversation.
*  And I will say, I know personally a lot of OBGYNs
*  who 100% will draw an AMH blood test
*  if you're at your annual and you ask.
*  And I recommend all of my OB friends,
*  because I see people at a different stage, right?
*  When they see me, they're struggling to get pregnant
*  or they wanna freeze their eggs.
*  But when we talk about this, I say,
*  hey, just like you say, are you trying to get pregnant now?
*  And if somebody says no, and your follow-up question is,
*  well, do you wanna be on birth control?
*  The same question should be,
*  well, do you wanna be pregnant at some point?
*  And if so, should you consider freezing your eggs
*  or getting this blood test checked?
*  And very often people will make a different decision
*  with that information.
*  I'm so glad that you're highlighting this
*  because my understanding is,
*  at least in the state of California,
*  I don't know about other states
*  or if it even varies by state,
*  that the opportunity to harvest eggs and freeze them,
*  there's a hard cutoff at age, I think it is 42.
*  Prior to age 42, they'll do it.
*  After 42, they'll do it if and only if
*  you're willing to do in vitro fertilization
*  to actually fertilize and then they'll freeze embryos.
*  But they're far more reluctant to collect eggs after age 42.
*  Yes and no.
*  So when you think about,
*  egg freezing and IVF are really the same process, right?
*  When you're going through the exact same thing,
*  you're taking the eggs out of the body
*  and then you're either just freezing them as an egg
*  or you're fertilizing them in the lab
*  and that's IVF and making an embryo right away.
*  Egg freezing has changed dynamically
*  over the past 10 years.
*  Whereas 10 years ago, survival rate of eggs in the lab
*  was 40%, really terrible.
*  And so we really didn't offer it to many people.
*  It wasn't something that was talked about.
*  And now it feels trendy almost,
*  but it's really just the tech has gotten so much better.
*  And cheaper.
*  Yeah, 90% of eggs now survive.
*  The freeze thaw.
*  So 90% is not a low number by any means.
*  Embryos are much stronger, right?
*  An egg is a single cell.
*  It's a single cell.
*  An embryo, when we freeze an embryo that's day five or six
*  is 300 plus cells.
*  So it's so much stronger.
*  And those embryos survive the freeze thaw 99% of the time.
*  So yes, there's a 9% difference.
*  That being said, making embryos is a lot more expensive.
*  Eggs is cheaper.
*  You could do two rounds of eggs
*  and have just as many eggs or have more eggs
*  than if you'd made them into embryos right away.
*  So I never recommend that somebody commits to a sperm source
*  that they don't wanna have a child with
*  unless that's the sperm source they wanna have a child.
*  And this has changed because when embryo survival
*  was so much greater than egg survival,
*  especially if you had few eggs or you were older,
*  making embryos was the only option.
*  What we do know is that egg quality
*  decreases immensely as we get older.
*  And we've touched on this,
*  but we haven't really mentioned it.
*  So not only do you have fewer eggs as you get older,
*  the chromosomes inside start to lose their positioning.
*  And so we think about egg quality,
*  we think about genetic normalcy,
*  and we know that the rates of aneuploidy
*  or abnormal chromosomes increases
*  proportionally to your age.
*  Which for people that aren't aware,
*  are going to predispose, not always, to miscarriages
*  if they're implanted or potentially even the formation
*  of a fetus that carries, for instance, trisomies,
*  so chromosomal repeats or lack of certain chromosomes.
*  These could be deadly or they could be capable
*  of carrying to term and then,
*  but have undetectable to mild
*  to severe developmental abnormalities, correct?
*  Correct, and this is why you have a lower probability
*  of pregnancy per month as you get older.
*  So if we look at your natural fecundibility,
*  it's not because you have fewer eggs,
*  because we already said your egg count per month,
*  it doesn't impact your probability of getting pregnant.
*  It's because the normalcy of those chromosomes
*  has changed so dramatically that the odds
*  that your body's randomly choosing the good one to ovulate
*  becomes so low, and that's why those natural fertility rates
*  are so low because most genetically abnormal eggs
*  do not fertilize or implant.
*  But if they do, they have a significantly higher chance
*  of miscarriage, it's 40% at age 40, right?
*  So you have a much lower chance
*  of seeing the positive pregnancy test,
*  but then your chance of losing that pregnancy
*  is significantly higher as well.
*  So when we are counseling somebody about egg-freezing,
*  what we know is that not every egg
*  is going to fertilize with sperm,
*  going to make an embryo, going to be genetically normal,
*  or even implant when it is genetically normal.
*  There is huge loss in human reproduction,
*  meaning the more eggs you have at a younger age,
*  the better the ROI on this process is gonna be.
*  It doesn't mean you don't do it when people get older,
*  but every clinic does have a cutoff,
*  and every clinic's gonna be a little bit different.
*  A lot of different reasons why.
*  We actually probably have an older cutoff,
*  so we will let somebody go through IVF
*  or freeze their eggs up to age 45.
*  And it's a lot about informed consent
*  and having the approach that you're smart enough
*  that if I give you the odds and I walk you through
*  how many eggs you have and the likelihood of them
*  making into embryos, you can say,
*  yeah, but four eggs or 10 eggs is way more than zero
*  based on my circumstance.
*  And that is worth it to me because it gives me
*  the opportunity to potentially have a child
*  when otherwise my opportunity is going to be zero.
*  So a lot of this is rooted in paternalism
*  that people can't, as a patient, understand these odds
*  and they have unrealistic expectations.
*  I think there's a huge shift in reproductive medicine
*  to really counseling patients and giving them autonomy
*  and some of these decisions,
*  but there does become a point where there's the likelihood
*  of finding a normal egg is so, so low
*  that the money or the expense of the process
*  doesn't make sense and people should utilize egg donation
*  or other opportunities for conception.
*  This drop in both the number of eggs and the egg quality,
*  they really start to become so profound at age 37 and on.
*  And that's when we really start to see both these things
*  are overlapping at the same time.
*  So if you're waiting till age 35, 36 for your first kid,
*  but you want two or three,
*  we've got to really look forward about
*  is that strategy makes sense?
*  Well, what is your AMH?
*  One, are you going to run out of eggs before then?
*  Two, what other issues could be going on?
*  Is the sperm fine or the tubes open?
*  Because we are seeing that when people start families later,
*  when people have more chronic illness
*  and autoimmune disease and obesity,
*  that it's much harder to get pregnant.
*  And so the birth rates are for the first time
*  in a long time across the board are dropping
*  and infertility is rising
*  because of all of these factors combined.
*  So based on everything you just said,
*  and yes, I'm gonna say it a fifth time
*  because the misconception about this
*  is one of the primary reasons
*  why people avoid harvesting eggs.
*  It's not the only reason,
*  but when you harvest eggs, freeze them.
*  Now it sounds like the viability of those eggs
*  is quite strong compared to a few years ago.
*  So that's great, 90% recovery when they thaw them
*  is not going to diminish the number of eggs in the vault.
*  Such a critical point.
*  And post age 37, there's a,
*  sounds like a nonlinear drop off in egg quality for most.
*  And these are averages, right?
*  So everyone-
*  So the people that got pregnant with healthy kids
*  in their late thirties and forties,
*  yes, we hear you.
*  Congratulations, we're happy.
*  But this speaks to the logic anyway,
*  we're not putting any emotion or circumstances on this,
*  but the logic of somebody in their,
*  let's say late twenties, early thirties,
*  getting their AMH levels
*  through a roughly $80 blood draw.
*  And then perhaps based on their life goals
*  and circumstances doing either one or several rounds
*  of egg collection and freezing.
*  Especially since it sounds like you don't need
*  to fertilize those eggs.
*  So if one doesn't have a partner
*  is concerned about what they're going to do,
*  who's going to be, who's going to provide the sperm?
*  You know, cause of course some people choose
*  to raise kids on their own,
*  but parenting is a whole other issue.
*  But they could do that later.
*  So that raises the questions of what are the health risks,
*  if any, pain levels, if any,
*  and that includes psychological pain of egg harvest.
*  I mean, so going back to what you said earlier,
*  this is going to be injecting synthetic mimics
*  of FSH and LH, follicle stimulating hormone
*  and luteinizing hormone, maybe some growth hormone.
*  I hear nowadays there's also the practice
*  of injecting these are essentially platelet rich plasma,
*  PRP, platelet rich plasma, excuse me, PRP,
*  perhaps even into the ovarian vault.
*  We can get back to that.
*  So there's a bunch of stuff that's being done to someone.
*  There's low stim where people are getting
*  like low doses of these drugs.
*  There's high stim where it's like a full blast.
*  Maybe you could walk us through that procedure
*  and just sort of general contour,
*  cause it would require a lot of time
*  to go through it all in detail.
*  But is this a horrible thing to go through?
*  Is it mild to go through?
*  Is it like a walk in the park?
*  Let's walk through it all.
*  So I love this and this is my bread and butter
*  and this is what I do every day.
*  Studies tell us that if you are not ready to have a family
*  by age 32 to 33, that that is the optimal time
*  for the average person to intervene and freeze their eggs.
*  It's not up for debate.
*  It's when you have both the intersection
*  of still a good egg quality
*  and good egg quantity on average.
*  And so that is younger than a lot of people
*  are thinking about having families.
*  And the reason why is when we really think
*  about what happens to the egg afterward,
*  that's what's really critically important.
*  So I'm gonna answer the question about what you go through,
*  but just thinking, we already said you freeze your eggs,
*  90% of them are gonna survive the freeze-off.
*  About 75% will be fertilized by sperm
*  and about 50% of those will even make it
*  to an implantation stage embryo or a blastocyst.
*  And we're assuming healthy sperm.
*  So sperm, no DNA, excessive DNA fragmentation.
*  Already hit the nail on the head.
*  One of the biggest issues with egg freezing
*  is I don't know the future.
*  I don't know if this sperm is going to be great or not.
*  I don't-
*  It could be from a pot smoker, just kidding pot smokers.
*  Not kidding pot smokers, we're not.
*  But we don't know, right?
*  So we have this future yet undetermined sperm source.
*  So I am going to assume you're gonna fall average
*  on these data points that we're gonna walk through.
*  But the reality is you buffer the risk
*  by having more eggs frozen.
*  And that's why people are going through multiple rounds
*  or cycles because we don't know.
*  We don't know how that fertilization will be.
*  If you have 20 eggs and 18 survive the freeze thaw
*  and 14 fertilize and seven make it to the blastocyst stage.
*  If you're age 30, we would anticipate around 60 to 70%
*  of them are gonna be genetically normal.
*  You're young, so that's already kind of a big hit
*  at that age.
*  So let's say of the seven, four of them
*  are genetically normal.
*  When I go to transfer them,
*  I have at best a 65% chance of live birth per embryo,
*  which is really good when you put in the lens
*  of accountability and peak success
*  tends to be closer to 20%.
*  And you're gonna implant one embryo at a time?
*  100% we're gonna implant one embryo at a time now.
*  Does anyone ask for two?
*  People ask for two, doctors will do two.
*  It lowers live birth rates.
*  If we're looking at giving each embryo
*  the healthiest opportunity at becoming a baby,
*  number one, embryos with IVF have a slightly higher chance
*  of monozygotic twinning, right?
*  So twinning, fraternal twinning comes.
*  If you ovulate two eggs, they both get fertilized.
*  So each baby is completely different,
*  genetically own egg, own sperm.
*  Monozygotic is from an embryo split.
*  Because of the IVF process, likely putting the embryo
*  in the catheter, maybe having that outer surface touched,
*  predisposes it to splitting after you put it into the body.
*  So more identical twins, monozygotic.
*  There's 2-3% chance of monozygotic twins with IVF
*  and the natural chance is .03%.
*  So significantly higher, even though ultimately
*  not a probable outcome, I'm gonna have a couple patients
*  a year who are going to have monozygotic twins.
*  And if I put two embryos in, I've now one taken this
*  from a potential twin pregnancy to a triplet
*  or even a quad if they both split.
*  So hence presumably like the Octomom cases
*  and things like that.
*  They just literally put eight embryos inside,
*  but that's a whole, I mean, that's medical malpractice.
*  But really most of the time when we're talking
*  about embryos, we're talking about people with infertility
*  or people who've spent a significant amount of money,
*  a huge portion of fertility is embryo quality.
*  The competency of the embryo, the genetics of the embryo,
*  it's expensive to go through egg freezing and IVF.
*  Yet the uterine environment is another component.
*  It doesn't make sense to waste multiple embryos
*  in the same uterine environment.
*  Statistically, it doesn't make sense.
*  It also doesn't make sense to make your embryos
*  compete against each other.
*  So will people put one embryo into,
*  let's just say DNA mom, right?
*  And one into surrogate mom
*  and try and get two siblings simultaneously?
*  I've definitely done that and had patients do that.
*  It's not common because surrogacy using a gestational carrier
*  is so expensive and there's such limited supply.
*  It's very hard to find somebody who wants to go through
*  the act of carrying a child for somebody else.
*  But that definitely is a strategy that some people utilize,
*  especially if they're older or they're concerned
*  that they might have a lower chance of implantation,
*  but they wanna give themselves a try.
*  But if we look at one embryo, 65% chance of success.
*  Cumulative probability after the second is 88%, okay?
*  Almost everybody's pregnant after two
*  and these are euploid genetically normal embryos, okay?
*  And then if you go to the third,
*  so cumulatively after three, euploid embryo transfers,
*  each one being a single embryo,
*  95% of people have a baby in their arms,
*  meaning the incidence of recurrent implantation failure
*  is actually pretty low, 5%.
*  But how many normal embryos do you need for what family size
*  if you're freezing your eggs?
*  Because you got 20 eggs at age 30 in the example I gave
*  and you just made four normal embryos, right?
*  So that's really unlikely to make three or four kids.
*  It has a really good chance of making one,
*  gives you the opportunity for a second,
*  but that's also presuming that everything happened perfectly
*  that the sperm is not pot smoking sperm,
*  but you know what I mean, not bad quality sperm.
*  There's not other environmental issues
*  when it comes to your own health
*  when you're trying to get pregnant
*  or other diseases you may have.
*  So we really need a higher number of eggs,
*  specifically when we don't know
*  what the equation will truly look like
*  for one individual person when they go through the process.
*  And one of the only added benefits of embryos,
*  especially if you are partnered,
*  if you're with somebody who you do wanna have children with,
*  you just don't wanna have them yet,
*  is that I know the downstream, I know the number,
*  I know how many embryos I have,
*  and if it's not enough to give you a high chance
*  of what you want your family to be,
*  you can intervene now, right?
*  Because by definition with egg freezing,
*  we're not wanting to be pregnant for years.
*  So if you're doing this with a partner
*  and you're making embryos,
*  and now I say we only got one genetically normal embryo,
*  you have the opportunity to choose
*  to either go through more cycles
*  and store more embryos for later,
*  to maybe try to get pregnant sooner
*  because there's some underlying issue with your fertility,
*  you can make a choice
*  because you're falling off the curve there.
*  I just wanted to ask you a question.
*  You mentioned age about 32, 33 in an ideal circumstance
*  with the finances there, et cetera,
*  one would harvest eggs
*  unless they're already starting a family
*  through natural means.
*  What about for sperm?
*  I mean, we've all heard the studies
*  that with increased age of the sperm,
*  that there's a higher,
*  although still statistically pretty small incidents
*  of things like spectrum conditions.
*  So do you recommend to young males,
*  men in their late 20s, early 30s to free sperm?
*  I mean, it's never gonna be wrong to save your gametes
*  because we don't have crystal balls for the future, right?
*  So your gametes are your eggs and your sperm.
*  That increase in, we'll just say negative outcome
*  from advanced paternal age
*  really starts to be seen at age 50.
*  So most men are not looking at
*  primarily starting their family after that age,
*  however, what I run into all the time is
*  maybe you're working on a second family
*  or maybe life has gone down a different pathway
*  and now you're with a partner
*  who potentially is younger and wants to conceive
*  and you now have older sperm.
*  Having sperm in the bank is so cheap and easy to free sperm.
*  Eggs, I haven't even answered your primary question.
*  And the process of collecting sperm
*  while not entirely without its issues is far simpler.
*  It's embarrassing at best, but it's much simpler.
*  Yeah, it's much simpler.
*  Generally doesn't require hormone injections,
*  although, maybe for rare instances
*  where people are hypogonadal or something.
*  But if you're gonna freeze your sperm, you're right.
*  Typically, you're going to get some blood work done
*  because most places that store sperm per FDA guidelines
*  have to make sure that if you carried an infectious disease,
*  it's stored in a special tank.
*  So you'll have to get blood work done.
*  Then you'll have to abstain for your two to three days,
*  collect into a cup, you're done.
*  Which by the way, guys, you can do at home and bring it in.
*  Sperm are so stable. Yes.
*  If you've ever done this, you just bring it in.
*  Just carry it in a little bag.
*  A little bit of, I think I'm not gonna feign
*  that my friend did this and told me.
*  But it's kind of outrageously easy
*  in the sense that you just bring it in
*  and they'll take it out in the lobby and be like,
*  is that your name?
*  And they'll do it very different
*  than the egg collection procedure.
*  So here's what I'll say about sperm
*  and what I wish more men knew slash more men did.
*  If you're gonna get a vasectomy
*  because you are choosing that you don't wanna have kids,
*  and we see many men who do this.
*  They say they don't wanna have kids.
*  They wanna go get a vasectomy.
*  Yet later on in life, you don't have a crystal ball
*  about life is dynamic and things can change.
*  If you're gonna get a vasectomy, go free sperm first.
*  Why are so many men getting vasectomies?
*  I don't have the answer to that.
*  I hadn't heard this.
*  Yeah, a lot of men are getting vasectomies
*  even I think to just take control
*  over not having a child out there when they don't want to.
*  So- Maybe this explains the drop in birth rates.
*  I'm just kidding.
*  This is multifactorial.
*  So many people, even if you're in your family,
*  let's say you have two kids and you all decided
*  you're gonna get the vasectomy
*  so that you don't have any more children,
*  things happen, terrible things happen, life changes.
*  There might be a circumstance
*  where you potentially would have another kid
*  if something really bad happened
*  or you just changed your mind.
*  Freezing sperm is so easy and so much easier
*  than if you don't, not all vasectomy reversals work,
*  especially the longer that it's been reversed,
*  the lower the likelihood that it's actually going to work.
*  And very often if it does,
*  you don't get sperm in sufficient levels
*  for a timed intercourse and you're seeing me in the office.
*  And freezing sperm is cheap.
*  I mean, it's relatively cheap.
*  It's like $400, right?
*  So it's much, much cheaper all in
*  than the entire egg freezing process.
*  So to answer the original question,
*  when you go through egg freezing,
*  most people do fantastic.
*  And we'll just use egg freezing and IVF interchangeably here
*  because what you as a person is going through
*  to harvest your eggs or to take them out of your body
*  is exactly the same, right?
*  The distinction between egg freezing and IVF
*  is all about what happens on the lab end of it
*  after they've come out of your body.
*  So if we have this group of eggs that comes out of the vault,
*  your body doesn't want to allow them all to grow,
*  even if it's a low number, right?
*  That's the check-in balance to not have so many kids.
*  So we need to override that process
*  and what we tend to do with this
*  is to use a combination of hormonal medications.
*  And very often I describe it to patients
*  as suppressing your body and then stimulating it.
*  So if I can temporarily stop the production of FSH
*  and you have a group of eggs come out of the vault
*  and we can imagine that FSH is their food
*  and there is no food
*  because you're taking the birth control pill for three weeks,
*  these eggs are going to synchronize, be very small,
*  be very hungry, for lack of a better word,
*  their FSH receptors are going to open all up.
*  It's like a nest of baby birds that are all now starving
*  instead of the hungry bird gets the worm.
*  So now we go with this suppression period for a few weeks,
*  we can come in and give gonadotropins, which is FSH and LH.
*  FSH is now synthetically made in a lab.
*  It's very easy, it's a synthetic compound
*  that mimics the structure of the brain, FSH.
*  We actually can't synthetically make LH, very interesting.
*  We don't have a way to make it yet
*  and so we use the purified urine of menopausal women
*  because when you're in menopause,
*  your FSH and LH levels are naturally so high
*  because they're trying to get that egg
*  to make some estrogen.
*  So here are some that we've covered
*  male hormone health before
*  and there's been a discussion of HCG,
*  human chorionic gonadotropin,
*  which is essentially mimics LH.
*  In the receptor it does, yes.
*  So is pregnal human chorionic gonadotropin,
*  is it purified from postmenopausal women's urine?
*  Or is it synthetic?
*  HCG is synthetic.
*  And so why can't-
*  It's called menopure.
*  Menopure is a combination of FSH and LH.
*  The reason why we give HCG to men
*  to try to stimulate the spermatogenesis process,
*  which of course, if we could just give LH, we'd give LH.
*  It's the same reason why we give HCG for a trigger.
*  If we are going to go through fertility treatments
*  and we're trying to mimic that LH surge,
*  which naturally would cause ovulation,
*  we actually are giving HCG
*  because it does mimic LH
*  when it comes to the receptor action of it.
*  But when it comes to really,
*  especially in getting follicular development
*  and the relationship between LH and FSH,
*  meaning LH is really providing
*  some of the hormone substrate
*  that we need to be able to make estrogen.
*  And so you really need some LH in a lot of people,
*  depending on your protocol,
*  or if you're older and you're naturally making less.
*  The example, or the offshoot,
*  would be the PCOS patient who has some naturally high LH.
*  Sometimes they don't actually need LH in their protocol.
*  But the-
*  So who are these postmenopausal women
*  that are supplying their urine?
*  I don't know. They're paid?
*  Right, right.
*  Yeah, I sort of imagine them on some island, some place.
*  Yeah, interesting.
*  Go to the menopause.
*  Getting paid to urinate.
*  And it's called menopure.
*  Like it's purified menopausal urine, right?
*  It's wild.
*  I did not know that.
*  Most people don't know that.
*  They know now.
*  Now they know.
*  And so we use FSH and LH,
*  we'll just say, in lack of better terms,
*  those are the two primary compounds that we're giving
*  over the course of, on average, a 12-day period
*  to get the follicles to grow and the eggs to mature.
*  So you can measure egg maturity
*  by blood levels of estradiol
*  and by transvaginal ultrasounds.
*  So when you're going through egg freezing or IVF,
*  you're taking these hormone shots of FSH and LH,
*  and they are getting those follicles to start to grow.
*  The eggs are starting to mature.
*  We are monitoring them along the way,
*  trying to determine the time period
*  where we think most of the eggs will be in the mature range.
*  These eggs have gotten to maturity.
*  You then are going to take a trigger shot,
*  which allows that final stage of meiosis
*  so those chromosomes can separate, right?
*  So we think about the egg,
*  we remember that normal female genetics, 46XX,
*  and I always think about in the egg
*  that these chromosomes are lined up.
*  Your eggs are frozen inside your body.
*  When you're born, your eggs are in metaphase of meiosis.
*  So that's when, right, metaphase,
*  chromosomes meet in the middle,
*  and they're held apart by these meiotic spindles.
*  And this is why eggs are so stinking fragile
*  because they're held like this.
*  And those meiotic spindles just absorb
*  the air of your life,
*  but when you use that trigger shot,
*  that LH surge naturally, or that HCG in a cycle,
*  that's when you're going to get that final separation
*  into half the eggs,
*  half those chromosomes into the egg.
*  So for people listening, think about like a zipper.
*  Oh, I love that.
*  And you're pulling apart of a zipper
*  that then you now have the chromosomes,
*  just one, you now have halved the chromosomes,
*  because why?
*  Because in successful fertilization,
*  the other chromosomes are going to come from sperm.
*  The sperm, and that's why this process has more air,
*  the older you are, and the longer your chromosomes
*  have been sitting there,
*  because those spindles are going to break down,
*  and we're going to have that increase in aneuploidy,
*  like we already said, purely because of this impact.
*  Can I ask a question about that specifically?
*  I think now would be the right time to ask,
*  which is that my understanding is that
*  a lot of the dynamics of pulling apart
*  of this zipper-like thing, these chromosomes,
*  and then is related to mitochondrial DNA,
*  because there are a lot of mechanics.
*  We're literally talking about an egg splitting itself
*  in half.
*  The mitochondria has its powerhouses.
*  Yeah, and the mitochondria.
*  And so mitochondrial health is a big topic these days.
*  And so we will be sure to touch on nutrition,
*  supplementation, and prescription drugs
*  that impact mitochondrial health.
*  But I've heard of a new procedure called three-parent IVF,
*  where they're taking basically the DNA
*  from the intended mom, the DNA from intended dad,
*  and then putting it into a surrogate,
*  like a donor egg that is where the DNA has been sucked out,
*  and then, because it has healthier, younger
*  mitochondrial DNA.
*  So you're essentially, let's say you've got a couple
*  in there, let's say late 30s, early 40s,
*  and they're not getting successful embryos
*  or implantations or whatever.
*  So they'll take the DNA from mom and dad
*  and they'll merge it with a third parent encapsulation.
*  There are clinics that do this.
*  I know that a lot of this was actually being done
*  in Eastern Europe until recently.
*  Mexico offers, there are places in Mexico that do this.
*  In England, it's been used to solve
*  mitochondrial dysfunction, but in the US,
*  this is still not legal, is that right?
*  Yes, so the purpose of what you're talking about,
*  essentially, when we think about utilizing
*  a donor mitochondrial or donor egg,
*  the point of that technology existed
*  to help cure mitochondrial diseases,
*  which are 100% fatal.
*  And so you would have this subset of people who would,
*  because if you're the mom, you always pass on
*  your mitochondria to all of the offspring.
*  So if there's disease inherent in your mitochondria,
*  everybody's going to get it.
*  And these are very severe diseases.
*  So the idea of this was first to say,
*  hey, can we overcome this mitochondria disease
*  and give people the opportunity, which it has done that.
*  So it works when done properly.
*  When done properly, especially for that purpose.
*  Now that purpose is distinct because
*  those people aren't infertile.
*  There's something else going on
*  within their mitochondrial disease.
*  Utilizing that technology to overcome age-related changes
*  in the eggs has not been successful yet.
*  Are we hopeful that it can?
*  Will people charge you money for it in certain places?
*  Yes, but you're hitting on a really important topic,
*  is that the political environment of embryo research
*  in the United States makes it extremely hard for us
*  to be the pioneers of new technology in this space.
*  And that is because a lot of views about an embryo
*  or when does life begin that happens here in the US
*  that results in limiting the availability
*  and the possibility of doing research
*  in a meaningful way on human embryos.
*  Right, because it would require the destruction of a lot of,
*  and it would also, and I looked into this a little bit
*  from an academic perspective, to be clear.
*  It would also require that the abortions
*  be performed differently because suction abortions
*  destroy embryos in ways that extraction abortions don't.
*  So there's a very controversial topic.
*  I mean, it's something that maybe we'll return to
*  in an episode about stem cells in the future.
*  Yeah, it's fascinating because,
*  especially if you look at IVF,
*  the whole separate issue is that there's millions of embryos
*  that people are no longer using
*  because they have had success,
*  they had extra embryos in the bank,
*  they got divorced, a variety of reasons.
*  And a lot of people would like
*  to donate their embryos to science, feel like,
*  hey, I don't wanna have this embryo implanted.
*  I don't wanna carry this child,
*  but potentially could something good
*  or could it help advance the field?
*  But that's not really a tangible option.
*  When people do that, what is actually happening
*  is their embryos are being utilized to train embryologists,
*  which is valid, right, to teach them how to
*  thaw and freeze and biopsy and do different things.
*  So it's still useful, but it's not in a meaningful way
*  like we'd really love to be able to utilize
*  to advance the science, especially for these embryos
*  that have been created, yet people no longer need them
*  for family growth.
*  So what happens to all the embryos that people don't use?
*  It's a fantastic question right now.
*  They sit in storage.
*  This is- Forever?
*  Well, this is a new problem, okay?
*  IVF is only 40-ish years old.
*  Embryo freezing alone, right?
*  The first IVF, we haven't even gone through
*  the whole process, but the first IVF baby,
*  there's no FSH-LH to stimulate more of the eggs
*  outside the vault to grow, so they followed
*  the single follicle and they didn't have the procedure,
*  which we do now, which is a minimally invasive procedure
*  to extract eggs.
*  We go vaginally with a needle attached to the ultrasound
*  and we enter into each follicle and we drain it.
*  The very first IVF, you followed one follicle
*  and you went in abdominally with a surgery
*  to put that needle into the follicle and drain it out
*  and give that just one egg a chance.
*  And then of course, there was no embryo freezing originally.
*  So the field is still rather young to understand
*  some of this and as technology rapidly improves,
*  we see things like better success rates
*  with freezing and thawing embryos,
*  better process of getting more embryos to grow,
*  but now we have a lot of embryos in storage
*  that may or may not be used.
*  I personally tell people, you should keep your embryos,
*  you should pay the storage fee, until no matter what,
*  the worst thing on planet Earth happens to you,
*  you're done having children because sadly,
*  I live in a spectrum with my field
*  where I see a lot of sadness
*  and people who maybe have lost a child,
*  something else has happened and they have maybe a sibling
*  who they feel like they really wanna give
*  this sibling child the chance to be a sibling again.
*  And often you're much older when you're experiencing this
*  and if you had had embryos frozen that you could have used
*  but you got rid of them, you're gonna be really upset
*  if you find yourself in that circumstance.
*  So I would say you should save them until you know
*  that you are not going to need them.
*  And then what do you do with them?
*  Most people just discard them.
*  Some people will donate them to labs,
*  which is called for research,
*  but mostly it's for embryologist training.
*  To get better at doing IVF.
*  To get better, which is also important.
*  But embryo donation is a new thing.
*  So being able to, just like we have people
*  who donate sperm and donate eggs,
*  embryo donation is the next evolution of an opportunity
*  to allow more people to become parents.
*  It's a little bit of the Wild West.
*  People finding people in Facebook groups and connecting.
*  It's this whole other dynamic when it comes to
*  what we call third party reproduction
*  or what do you do with known donors and things like that.
*  But it's a very interesting concept.
*  So this problem is emerging
*  as the technology is getting better.
*  I'm realizing now, remembering rather,
*  that when I was in college and graduate school,
*  you would see these ads in the student paper.
*  The freezer sperm.
*  For egg donors and sperm donors.
*  Sperm are generated throughout the lifespan.
*  So that's a kind of less controversial issue.
*  But this is now not allowed most places to advertise
*  for egg donors on college campuses.
*  That's my understanding.
*  The egg donors were often paid, whatever they were paid.
*  I'm not gonna say it was reasonable amounts or not.
*  Cause I don't recall what they were paid.
*  And everyone's circumstances are different.
*  But the argument that most people use against this is,
*  oh, these people are giving up eggs
*  that they could otherwise use.
*  But we now know that's not true.
*  So do you have any knowledge as to like,
*  what was the rationale for kind of limiting
*  the recruitment of egg donors?
*  Anyway, I'm not arguing for or against.
*  It's no longer supported based on what you said
*  by the argument that they're losing eggs
*  they would otherwise be able to keep.
*  Some of it's about proper informed consent,
*  especially at an age where the financial incentive
*  can be very persuasive without understanding.
*  That makes sense.
*  Not that it harms your fertility later,
*  but that you're going to have genetic children out there.
*  And you might potentially, and we are seeing this now,
*  we don't know if you individually will have infertility
*  for a variety of reasons.
*  Cause you're not trying to have a family until much later.
*  But the same concern doesn't seem to exist
*  for men who are donating sperm.
*  I mean, it should.
*  But there's this whole donor conceived community
*  where people are really talking about
*  putting new restrictions on,
*  we'll use sperm donation for example.
*  There are sperm donors who have hundreds of children.
*  Hundreds, right?
*  There are these sibling pods
*  because it's been so unlimited.
*  And sperm banks are a business that work to make money
*  and they make money by selling more sperm.
*  But that's not healthy.
*  One, for a population, you need genetic diversity.
*  But also it's not healthy necessarily for one person
*  to have all these half siblings
*  and to just not know when you're going to run into somebody
*  who could potentially be your sibling.
*  Is it this guy at the bar that you like?
*  Do you have to worry about that if your donor conceived?
*  So we're starting to see sperm banks finally start to reel
*  back and put limitations on how many families,
*  total children's tough, right?
*  Because one family might have a child
*  and you want them to be able to have sibling children.
*  But at least for how many families
*  that that donor can contribute to.
*  And we're seeing sperm donors deal with the fact
*  that now there's no anonymous donation.
*  We can act like anonymous donation exists,
*  meaning it is not identified at the time
*  that somebody is utilizing the sperm.
*  But with direct to consumer testing for genetics,
*  like 23andMe and Ancestry,
*  people are being connected with their sperm donors,
*  with their egg donors, with their sibling pods.
*  And we have to believe that technology
*  is only going to improve over time.
*  So what people do for money, especially when they're young,
*  I think without understanding the potential ramifications.
*  And I don't want to act like sperm donation
*  or egg donation are bad.
*  They give people the opportunity to become parents
*  that otherwise might not be able to.
*  And that is a lovely and a beautiful gift,
*  but you need to understand what that might mean
*  and how that might impact your own potential children later
*  to know that they have genetic half-siblings out there.
*  Egg donation, people do get compensated much better
*  than sperm donation.
*  There are certain characteristics that are hard to find
*  that get compensated even more so.
*  And certain ethnicities, doctorate degrees
*  and things like that,
*  where somebody can really pay for their education
*  by donating their eggs.
*  It's a dilemma because what you'd love to say
*  is like, free some eggs for you too.
*  If you're going to do that,
*  you're at the perfect age to freeze your own eggs.
*  And there's been strategies to try to mitigate this.
*  And I don't want to get off too much on a tangent,
*  but it's a really fine line that you walk
*  with what people understand.
*  So there is a company and I won't name them,
*  but they are promoting that young women donate their eggs
*  and they will freeze half of them for you.
*  And half of them will go and become donor eggs.
*  Interesting business model,
*  but I could see the potential ethical concerns.
*  So I think ethically, this sounds good
*  because you get to freeze some eggs,
*  but I think more people will donate eggs
*  than otherwise would have
*  for some of the reasons we previously stated.
*  And I also think you would get more money
*  by simply donating your eggs and then turning around
*  and paying for a round of freezing your own eggs,
*  you would get paid more and you'd have more eggs
*  because one of the issues is,
*  do you now falsely believe
*  that you have enough eggs in the bank
*  because you did this split,
*  but you don't really have enough
*  because we already walked through the math at 20 eggs,
*  doesn't really result in such a high probability
*  of having a multi-child family.
*  So, there's a lot of ethical debate
*  in gamete and embryo donation.
*  It definitely is the wild west
*  and there's uncharted territory, even an embryo donation.
*  There's places who are very unethical about it,
*  who will only allow people to have embryos
*  if they are heterosexual, have been married for three years,
*  make a certain income, submit to a home study,
*  yet they let the people have no say
*  over the embryos that are transferred,
*  be it how many, what stage, what quality,
*  and they're taking people's money
*  and putting terrible embryos inside of them
*  and really wasting their resources,
*  which could have been used in another way.
*  Yeah, the dangers of profitization of biology.
*  Right, and tech, I mean, tech entering spaces is amazing,
*  but also technology starts to advance before studies, right?
*  Tech is gonna become, has more finance backing
*  than we see scientific studies get.
*  I feel like one of the major questions out there
*  is whether or not IVF babies, let's just call them that,
*  have a higher incidence of things like spectrum conditions
*  or other developmental trajectories, let's call them,
*  and I'm not trying to be politically correct here,
*  but I think nowadays the word disorder
*  has to be really carefully examined
*  when considering any neurologic and psychiatric situation.
*  We've had discussions about this on this podcast before,
*  but a lot of people are wondering, just to be direct,
*  a lot of people are wondering,
*  do more IVF babies have autism than non-IVF babies?
*  Is this a good question?
*  And it's changed over time in a couple different ways,
*  and I think this is important to understand.
*  So if we just think about the hormonal environment
*  with natural conception, and you have a peak estrogen,
*  let's say you have 200-something,
*  you have progesterone being made,
*  the placenta is implanting,
*  and what is the main difference with IVF babies?
*  And a lot of it has been tied back
*  to the uterine environment,
*  especially in what we call fresh embryo transfers,
*  which is really not a common practice anymore.
*  So in a fresh embryo transfer,
*  I'm gonna take the eggs out of your body,
*  fertilize them in the lab, and grow out embryos,
*  and then I'm going to put the best embryo
*  back in your body five days later
*  at the natural time of implantation.
*  And if we rewind the clock, that's how IVF was done,
*  when you couldn't freeze embryos very well
*  and they didn't survive.
*  And you'd put lots of embryos inside
*  because they wouldn't survive,
*  and that's the early days of IVF,
*  when you saw a lot of multiples,
*  a lot of high-order multiples,
*  and of course multiples have their own distinct issues
*  that put them at higher risk for developmental disorders
*  and issues with development and birth risk in general.
*  To be fair, they're commonly referred to as disorders.
*  I just think around autism in particular,
*  that there is a camp, a growing camp out there
*  that it referred to differently.
*  We've covered this.
*  Anytime this comes up, I bring up both,
*  just to highlight the fact that yes,
*  we are aware and sensitive to that emerging issue.
*  Right now, unfortunately, for sake of conversation,
*  there's no new nomenclature,
*  so we could easily get caught down
*  in the attempt to try and smooth over everything
*  with everybody and as a consequence, confuse everybody.
*  So I think we'll go for clarity forward
*  with the understanding that the nomenclature is changing.
*  Can't even say alcoholism anymore
*  because it's alcohol use disorder,
*  and I don't have a problem with that,
*  but a lot of people wonder if those are two different things.
*  It's just confusing,
*  and we want to simplify science for people.
*  Right, exactly, so feel free.
*  So when we first were doing IVF,
*  we're putting embryos back
*  in an extremely unnatural environment.
*  If you have 20 eggs growing
*  and each egg makes 200 picograms of estrogen,
*  suddenly now you have these extremely high
*  super physiologic estrogen levels,
*  higher progesterone levels
*  because there's more corpus luteums,
*  and this environment is not the normal
*  for how the placenta would invade
*  into that maternal blood circulature,
*  and a lot of these issues that are commonly associated
*  became so because of placental issues.
*  So a lot of things like growth restriction,
*  small for gestational age, preterm birth,
*  which further puts you at risk
*  for other developmental disorders,
*  were associated with these fresh transfers.
*  The field has changed.
*  We do a lot of frozen embryo transfers,
*  and a lot of it for this reason.
*  We see huge improvement in neonatal outcomes
*  when you bleed off that high hormonal uterine environment
*  and then regrow the lining of the uterus
*  and a hormonal level that's more natural
*  and then transfer the embryo,
*  and we see completely different fetal outcomes.
*  So that's fantastic as far as looking at the change
*  over the field, but of course,
*  if you take all IVF babies over all time,
*  it's a little murky because you have modern practice
*  and old practice.
*  We also know that infertility people,
*  if you get diagnosed with infertility,
*  so you're under age 35 and you try to get pregnant
*  with regular periods for one year and have not had success,
*  or you're 35 and older and you've tried for six months
*  and you've not had success,
*  you meet the medical definition for infertility.
*  When that happens, you now statistically,
*  regardless if you get pregnant naturally in the next month
*  or you do IVF, you have a 1% higher chance of birth defects
*  and you have a slightly higher chance
*  of developmental disorders.
*  So is it more population-based versus procedure-based?
*  And there's probably something to that
*  to underlying a lot of potentially what goes in
*  or what can cause infertility when it comes to quality
*  of eggs or sperm or uterine environment
*  or things that we're still learning about.
*  When it comes to autism specifically,
*  the number one strongest association we have
*  is advanced paternal age.
*  So when you look at the people and the male sperm comes
*  from an ejaculation after age 50,
*  that one does have the highest significance
*  associated with autism.
*  And also with some other very interesting
*  autosomal dominant disorders.
*  So we don't wanna take advanced paternal age likely,
*  although it does get so much less attention
*  than what we call advanced maternal age
*  or being over age 35 and a woman.
*  And that is purely because of the differences
*  in the sperm and the egg environment
*  and how their quality is impactful.
*  Thank you for that answer.
*  I think it's really important for people to hear that
*  because the lore out there is that higher incidence
*  of autism in IVF babies,
*  but it sounds like a good percentage of those
*  could be because of age-related factors
*  as well as technology-related factors
*  that and that the technology is getting better all the time
*  if I understood correctly.
*  We didn't complete the discussion of IVF
*  and I want to do that, talk about Ixie
*  and a few other things.
*  I know that's definitely your wheelhouse.
*  Before we do that, can we inject a little sub conversation
*  around this because I neglected to bring this up earlier
*  and I know there's a lot of curiosity about this
*  and then we'll finish off IVF.
*  Can we do that? Let's do it.
*  Sort of a pause in the IVF.
*  So the eggs are out, they're frozen, sperm's out,
*  it's frozen or maybe they're gonna put live sperm
*  on a non-frozen, excuse me,
*  sperm directly onto those unfrozen eggs.
*  We'll pause there, intermission for those potential embryos.
*  And talk about something that you've been very open about
*  which is, and a lot of people are not frankly
*  in your profession, so I really appreciate this,
*  which is nutrition and supplementation to optimize
*  the health of egg quality and not just for people
*  who want to get pregnant, but for people who believe
*  that fertility is a proxy for overall health.
*  So I mean, are there things that people should eat
*  and not eat, things that people should supplement
*  and not supplement in order to optimize their fertility?
*  I mean, this is definitely in interest of mine, right?
*  All my fellowship research cycles around
*  accountability and natural fertility.
*  And I think we really do a disservice
*  by how medicine really is categorized by organ systems
*  because we act like things in one place
*  don't impact the other.
*  As if. Right?
*  But you have a body and your body
*  and especially your hormones change and fluctuate
*  and they're meant to.
*  They are meant to be a dynamic system,
*  but the world and the environment of which
*  you are subjecting your body to has proven changes
*  on both hormonal function and also when it comes
*  to egg and sperm quality.
*  And so if you are somebody who just wants to live
*  your healthiest life and have your most regular periods
*  and have your hormones as well balanced as they can be,
*  for lack of a better word, we'll just say that that means
*  that they're functioning normally.
*  Then paying attention to the things that you do
*  are really important.
*  And so I know this is a big one for you.
*  Sleep is probably the number one thing that people don't do
*  that does impact their reproductive hormone system
*  and therefore can impact egg and sperm quality
*  because sleep is when you have cellular repair
*  and when you can drop your inflammation levels.
*  We know that inflammation is just toxic to eggs and sperm.
*  It is.
*  The inflammatory environment is not ideal for conception.
*  And then for a female, you have to deal with the fact
*  that you have your egg quality,
*  but you also have how inflammation or what you're exposed
*  to impacts your uterine environment.
*  So you have a two-fold situation here.
*  So none of this should be shocking news
*  when it comes to nutrition,
*  but it is not talked about enough.
*  You're right.
*  Decreasing inflammation by the foods that we put in our body
*  is consistently shown with an improvement in fecundability
*  and improvement in ovulation
*  and an improvement in success with IVF
*  and a decrease in miscarriage, right?
*  Huge studies have looked at these.
*  Now, the big caveat is that nutrition studies
*  are super hard because people who consume flax, for example,
*  tend to have other good health behaviors
*  that sometimes make it hard to identify what flax did
*  versus their general health
*  versus somebody who eats fast food every day.
*  Nutrition studies tend to be observational
*  and fertility studies are really hard too
*  because what endpoint are you using?
*  Is it getting pregnant?
*  Is it live birth?
*  Are you looking at IVF?
*  Are you looking at natural fertility?
*  And we have a lot of different overlap
*  that makes both of these a little bit difficult.
*  And so they're all cohort-based or population-based studies
*  where you analyze how people perform
*  when it comes to fertility treatments
*  or getting pregnant naturally
*  based on their exposures to certain things.
*  Diets high in fruits and vegetables are good for you, right?
*  Fiber, antioxidants, fruit is not bad.
*  Fruit got this really bad reputation.
*  Really? I love fruit.
*  I love fruit too, but people think that it has sugar
*  and that it's bad for you.
*  It has fructose, but you know.
*  No, it's not.
*  That type of sugar is not bad for you.
*  If we can just agree on the fact
*  that fruit has a lot of nutritional benefit,
*  especially when it comes to vitamins and antioxidants
*  that can be extremely beneficial in decreasing inflammation.
*  Grain, so whole grains especially that your body,
*  provide a lot of great fiber.
*  So of course, if you have celiac
*  or you're gluten intolerant, you're a different category.
*  But there was so much focus on keto
*  and people eliminating grains as a food group overall.
*  And even though that might be utilized
*  in a dietary strategy to lose weight
*  and losing weight can improve fertility,
*  likely because of inflammation being the primary driver
*  because we know that even in studies
*  where I take donor eggs and I transfer that embryo
*  into somebody who's overweight,
*  they have lower odds of success
*  than if they were a normal BMI.
*  So we can't act like that causation
*  is just on egg quality from obesity, right?
*  There's also some inflammation, some inflammatory changes
*  that impact the body's ability or desire
*  to allow an embryo to implant.
*  So fruits, veggies, whole grains are all good.
*  Interestingly, dairy tends to be okay in most studies,
*  but what we do see is that if you're gonna have dairy,
*  have the real thing, the processed dairy, the skim milk,
*  that actually decreases your fertility.
*  And likely because the processing
*  to make it still look like milk when you take out the fat
*  is adding in things that are unnatural,
*  potentially impacting your fertility.
*  I don't drink milk anymore,
*  but when I was a teenager, I drank half and half.
*  I'm not recommending anyone do that.
*  Remember I was a skiing teenager.
*  You were trying to bulk up.
*  Well, no, I just could afford to.
*  At that age, I wasn't trying to at all,
*  but it was just delicious.
*  So cheeses, whole fat milk, half and half yogurt.
*  Yeah, but don't choose the skim one.
*  Choose the actual one that comes with some of the milk fat.
*  Fat is not bad for you.
*  There's also this rate,
*  hopefully we're getting away from it,
*  but there's been such a low fat craze
*  for this real attention that fat is so bad,
*  but fat comes in so many important forms.
*  Avocados and oils and nuts, dairy, meat,
*  fat and cholesterol are the backbone for all hormones.
*  So you need that in order for your body
*  to make the estrogen and progesterone
*  that it needs to allow this whole process to happen.
*  And so there's this idea that those are bad for you.
*  That's just really not.
*  So healthy fats, whole grains, fruits, veggies.
*  And what about proteins and meats?
*  Because I think within those categories,
*  I'm a big fan of sustainably raised meats if possible.
*  Some people choose not to eat meat, but fish, eggs.
*  Love it all.
*  Okay, so let's just go through the meats
*  and the myth and the facts.
*  So we'll do tofu.
*  So there's this big issue that tofu has soy
*  and that too much soy can be bad
*  because soy can be a phytoestrogen.
*  Tofu does not negatively impact fertility,
*  even in men.
*  In fact, it can improve it
*  because it does have some antioxidant-like properties,
*  lots of iron.
*  When it comes to fish,
*  fish are fantastic sources of healthy fats
*  and omega-3 fatty acids,
*  which are very crucial in the reproductive process.
*  We do worry about if you're pregnant,
*  having too much fish and overexposure to mercury
*  and how that can impact fetal brain development.
*  So the general recommendation is three servings per week.
*  That doesn't-
*  Yeah, three servings is like four to six ounces
*  as opposed to like a real human that eats-
*  A real human.
*  Yeah, that eats six to eight ounces of fish.
*  And I think it's important to say,
*  even though people will tell you that
*  when you're trying to get pregnant
*  with the idea of we don't know
*  when you're going to be pregnant,
*  if you're going through things like egg freezing or IVF
*  and you know when you're going to be pregnant,
*  I wouldn't feel like you have to restrict yourself
*  on the consumption of seafood during those time periods
*  when you know you're not pregnant yet
*  because really the concern is about that mercury
*  and what it could potentially do to a fetal brain.
*  And raw seafood, correct?
*  No sushi, no sashimi.
*  Well, when you're pregnant, correct.
*  And that's mostly because of the risk of infectious disease
*  that can cause severe brain development and other issues.
*  What do they do in Japan?
*  I don't know.
*  I don't live there.
*  They probably laugh at this.
*  They probably do laugh at us.
*  They probably do laugh at us a lot.
*  Someone who's been pregnant in Japan.
*  Yeah, reach out, tell us.
*  Or conceived in Japan, tell us.
*  Don't tell us the story of the conception,
*  but tell us, did you have sashimi?
*  Overall, meat is a really broad category
*  and studies study it differently.
*  Like is it all meat?
*  Are you distinguishing now red meat and chicken?
*  Are you putting it all together?
*  I mean, obviously I think we can all come to the agreement
*  that processed meats are not good
*  for a variety of different reasons.
*  In addition to being carcinogenic,
*  those toxins do negatively impact fertility.
*  So deli meat no bueno.
*  So yeah, but then specifically those things like the bacon
*  and the things that are really highly prostate hot dogs,
*  sorry, the 4th of July hot dog picnic.
*  But those things really do not provide
*  nutritional advantages and only harm.
*  Especially then when we have red meat.
*  For the most part, red meat when isolated individually
*  in most circumstances in moderation tends to be fine.
*  I usually tell my patients,
*  I want them to eat a plant forward diet.
*  That doesn't mean no meat,
*  but I say, look at your meat servings.
*  I don't want it red meat every single day.
*  Because there was a study looking at IVF
*  and looking at embryos and the more servings,
*  a lot of nutritional studies based things on quartile.
*  So who eats the lowest and the second most
*  and the third most and the top most.
*  And people who ate in that top quartile of red meat
*  had lower progression of embryos through the culture.
*  So less embryos that developed,
*  less normal embryos and lower success rates.
*  Do we know anything about how that meat was arriving?
*  No, unfortunately we don't.
*  Are we talking about like hoagie sandwiches?
*  We don't know.
*  Or are we talking about grass-fed steaks?
*  Right, these studies are not wonderful,
*  but that doesn't mean that they don't hold merit
*  in helping us guide counseling.
*  But no, that one was,
*  how many servings of red meat do you eat in a week?
*  So we don't really know,
*  does the really ethically source the grass-fed,
*  this environment which we feel like is much less toxic
*  than potentially let's say like a cattle factory
*  where the cows are injected with all sorts of things.
*  Is there a difference in how those impact your reproduction?
*  Probably, right?
*  If this cow's getting injected with a lot of hormones,
*  why are we thinking that it's not impacting the meat
*  that you're then ingesting into your body?
*  No, I think our audience will certainly
*  subscribe to that idea.
*  I think most of them will.
*  I mean, the notion that like the pollutants you breathe
*  in the air somehow are not the air
*  that you breathe into your lungs is just like completely.
*  Wow.
*  And the idea.
*  But people feel that way
*  and they hold strongly to this idea
*  that it can't be this thing that I love
*  that is causing this problem, right?
*  The denial of the association
*  between what we put in and on our body
*  and how it impacts our body's function
*  is really strong in some people.
*  And I think it's really just lack of education
*  and awareness because the medical community for so long
*  did not address these factors, right?
*  Your doctor never talks to you about nutrition.
*  And so it just became this idea that it must not matter.
*  Otherwise your doctor would talk to you about it.
*  I think sugar is the last thing I just didn't mention,
*  but added sugar and artificial sugars are bad for you.
*  Artificial sugars.
*  Artificial sugars too.
*  Including stevia, sort of plant-based low calorie sweeteners.
*  Stevia itself hasn't been studied as much as the other ones,
*  things like sweet and low and all of those.
*  But what we do know is that they cause inflammation
*  inside the body and then they also can cause
*  a stress reaction and they can cause higher rates
*  of miscarriage when you intake more sugar
*  and artificial sugar.
*  So that's a lot to wrap your head around.
*  And I say the same thing to every patient.
*  One cake, one this, one hot dog.
*  I mean, those things individually
*  are not gonna make a difference, right?
*  It's the choices that you make every single day
*  that are going to set you up to be your healthy self or not.
*  And so you should make choices in line with
*  how you wanna treat yourself.
*  You want to be in your best health.
*  You want your hormones functioning the best.
*  And if that added helps you get pregnant when you want to,
*  helps you have a better chance of success with IVF,
*  what a fantastic benefit.
*  But that doesn't mean you can't enjoy
*  some of these bad things here and there
*  as long as you've set yourself up on the day to day
*  where you're giving your body lots of nutritious food
*  that it needs to make hormones.
*  Similarly, being very underweight and calorie restricting
*  we all know is really terrible for your reproductive system
*  and can cause the brain to totally shut down ovulation
*  because it senses that you can't have a pregnancy.
*  Do people miscarry, excuse me,
*  by virtue of being underweight?
*  Does the body, like I learned some years ago,
*  I think this is still true,
*  that one of the signals for the onset of puberty in females
*  is that leptin hormone is secreted from body fat
*  that then signals to the brain, to the hypothalamus,
*  like, okay, there's enough reserves to create environment.
*  It's a signal about environmental.
*  Yeah, there's enough extra fat to have a baby.
*  Yeah, and there's presumably enough food around
*  to sustain that baby.
*  Right, are miscarriages and lack of body fat correlated?
*  On both ends of the spectrum, yes.
*  Right, so lack of body fat and being overweight,
*  we see decrease in getting pregnant per month
*  and we see increase in losing pregnancies.
*  So certainly there is a healthy medium
*  where your body has what it needs.
*  And that makes sense because if you have,
*  I like to even say hypothalamic dysfunction.
*  So maybe your brain's not totally shut off
*  where it's sending out no hormones and you're not ovulating
*  because you're not getting pregnant in that circumstance.
*  But certainly, ovulation disorders are on a spectrum
*  where you go from a perfectly synchronized cycle
*  to one that prolongs it, gets shorter together,
*  then prolongs and then you have nothing.
*  There's this spectrum of dysfunction
*  which is representing your hormones
*  not being necessarily perfect
*  and that can have impacts on the placenta
*  trying to grow into that uterus.
*  I mean, the placenta is fascinating, right?
*  An entire talk just on the placenta.
*  But it does this incredible job
*  where your body has to not reject it
*  yet allow it to eat away at the side of your uterus
*  and grow into your blood vessels.
*  But that requires a very specific hormonal environment
*  for it to be done and to be done right.
*  I think in the same breath of all of this,
*  what you're also asking is,
*  yeah, okay, so that's eating healthy.
*  None of that's really new news for most people.
*  A lot of those things I just said.
*  Well, I think so, but I do want to thank you
*  because I think rarely, if ever,
*  do we hear somebody, a physician be really direct about like,
*  hey, listen, some red meat, yes,
*  not excessive amounts of red meat,
*  ideally from sustainable sources,
*  whole fat milk products, grains, fruits, vegetables.
*  I mean, those kind of straight,
*  what to you seem like straightforward directives
*  are actually pretty rare in the landscape
*  of public health discussion because more often than not,
*  people talk about nutrition
*  in these kind of elimination diet type things
*  like eliminate all the grains or eliminate all the meat
*  or eliminate all the milk fats.
*  When in reality, I think people forget
*  that most people out there are omnivores
*  and they can make better choices about not deli meat,
*  less bacon, if any bacon.
*  Have some veggies with your lunch.
*  You can make better choices on the day to day.
*  I think that is a great point.
*  I think there's a place for supplements.
*  I think the big disclaimer that everybody's gonna say
*  with supplements is that they are not regulated
*  like the way medications are, right?
*  And I will say supplements and herbs are different things.
*  A supplement, but many companies are adding herbs
*  to their supplements and that can get
*  into really murky territory, especially when it comes
*  to how some of these herbs do have estrogen
*  and progestin like properties
*  like reproduction and hormones.
*  And perhaps even androgenic properties too.
*  So we can't act like everything's created equal.
*  So I always tell people, if I recommend you take
*  a supplement or your doctor does,
*  your due diligence is to look at what is also included
*  and make sure it doesn't have these extra added things
*  that they're unaware of because sometimes they can have
*  negative impact at one stage of your life or another,
*  depending on where you are.
*  Certainly, a prenatal vitamin, which has folic acid,
*  we all know that folic acid is really important
*  to prevent neural tube defects,
*  but it's also important in cell division
*  and how the ovary is growing follicles and growing eggs.
*  So should people, women, but also men,
*  be taking a vitamin with folic acid
*  even when they're not trying to conceive?
*  There's no harm in having it,
*  but very often pregnancies occur
*  when you're not trying to conceive.
*  And that is a store that needs to be built up
*  three months ahead of time.
*  So we really need you to be taking that
*  ahead of getting pregnant.
*  So not just, let's get pregnant right now,
*  I'm going to start this prenatal vitamin.
*  So I recommend anybody who's in their reproductive years,
*  take a prenatal vitamin.
*  We also know that many, many people are vitamin D deficient
*  and vitamin D does impact reproduction.
*  And so I usually say a thousand international units
*  of vitamin D is not going to be harmful in anybody.
*  It's going to be helpful for most people.
*  Some people definitely need higher levels.
*  So we screen everybody with a vitamin D
*  to see who needs to have extra,
*  but a blanket statement that extra vitamin D
*  is going to be helpful.
*  Omega-3 fatty acids, also extremely important in,
*  one, being anti-inflammatory,
*  but two, brain development of a fetus.
*  So most prenatals now actually do have
*  those omega-3 fatty acids in them,
*  but if they don't, I recommend a patient take those.
*  Just a brief question slash insertion there.
*  There's a laboratory up at the University of California,
*  Santa Barbara that's published some really interesting data
*  showing that essentially brain weight,
*  which is just about one indirect measure of brain health,
*  but brain weight at birth seems to be correlated
*  at least in some positive way with the amount
*  of essential fatty acids that mom consumed during pregnancy.
*  Does that sound, does that-
*  Yeah, I mean, that does hold.
*  And there's, I mean, there's mice studies
*  about that mice are smarter when they have diets,
*  with omega-3 fatty acids when they're in utero, right?
*  So the exposure and the time period is really important.
*  And omega-3s have a lot of health benefits
*  when it comes to their antioxidant properties,
*  especially in like an endometriosis,
*  diseases that are very highly inflammatory.
*  They can be very beneficial.
*  We're definitely gonna talk about your work
*  about after baby has arrived
*  and the impact of essential fatty acids,
*  but what would you say is the dosage cutoff
*  on this podcast before I've sort of thrown out numbers
*  like one to two grams per day of the EPA form
*  of essential fatty acids?
*  And then we could have a whole discussion
*  about omega-3, omega-6 ratios,
*  but do you think there's a upper limit?
*  Is it truly that, you know,
*  let's say up to four grams per day of EPA,
*  would that be advantageous?
*  Is it better than one gram?
*  I tell people a gram.
*  A gram.
*  That's in alignment with pretty much
*  what we've talked about before.
*  So that's what I recommend, you know,
*  when I give my handout to my patients
*  and they're trying to get pregnant,
*  it's gonna have a prenatal,
*  a thousand I use of vitamin D,
*  a gram of omega-3s, and then CoQ10.
*  So CoQ10, which, you know, essentially in general
*  is trying to help the mitochondria.
*  That's the whole idea here
*  that it is helping provide support across the body
*  in a lot of different ways, right?
*  Like CoQ10 is used in a lot of different areas of the body,
*  but when it comes to reproduction,
*  when it comes to meiosis and cell division
*  and ovulation and egg quality and even sperm quality,
*  there's a place for CoQ10 showing benefit without harm,
*  right, and so no, as we said earlier,
*  nothing's without any harm or any risk of harm,
*  but very, very little.
*  So I usually recommend if you're trying to get pregnant
*  and you take CoQ10, a dose of 200 milligrams
*  three times a day.
*  So that's kind of a higher dose
*  than sometimes people are on.
*  Often prenatals now have just like 200 total in it.
*  And so we-
*  The expensive ingredients are usually
*  the lower concentrations in blends.
*  Just enough so they can put it on the label.
*  Right, which includes CoQ10.
*  Does the form of CoQ10 matter
*  because you'll find them in gel capsules.
*  You'll also find them in powdered capsules.
*  I always say, I mean,
*  there might be for the individual person,
*  I mean, absorption of medication
*  is really dependent a lot on gut health and other factors,
*  but the number one issue with supplementation
*  is that people don't stick to it.
*  So I always say, whichever one you're going
*  to consistently take is going to be the better form.
*  Great.
*  A question about L-carnitine.
*  I'm researching a little bit for this episode and others.
*  Oral L-carnitine has been associated
*  with some improvements in forward motility and sperm,
*  maybe egg quality,
*  but we know that a very small percentage
*  of the oral L-carnitine that one ingests
*  is actually utilized.
*  So some people actually purchase and use
*  injectable L-carnitine, which is kind of painful
*  because it's in an alcohol-based suspension,
*  so not comfortable.
*  It's got to be done intramuscularly.
*  But my read of the data is kind of impressive.
*  I wouldn't say super impressive.
*  Are you ever injecting patients
*  or having them inject themselves with L-carnitine?
*  This would be both male or female or male patients
*  or both, or using oral L-carnitine?
*  Or do the data just not impress you enough to motivate that?
*  We use a gram of L-carnitine with a gram of vitamin C
*  for our male patients who have any abnormal sperm parameter.
*  And so that is kind of what we consider
*  the sperm enhancement protocol.
*  And so- And just that.
*  That with the multivitamin. Got it.
*  So those two with the multivitamin and CoQ10.
*  So that's kind of like the male protocol.
*  Of course, there's different specifics
*  for one individual person.
*  I don't tend to recommend it for most females.
*  That being said, those who have endometriosis
*  fall into a unique category where inflammation is so high
*  that usually it's a different environment
*  where we recommend L-carnitine, N-acetylcysteine,
*  vitamin C and E.
*  They kind of fall into a different category
*  because they have a known inflammatory disease.
*  But if we're just talking about the person at whole
*  who maybe wants to take some supplements
*  for their reproductive health
*  that have very little side effects
*  and for the most part can potentially be helpful,
*  it's going to be CoQ10, L-carnitine, vitamin C
*  can be helpful especially for the male,
*  for the female partner.
*  We're going to be looking at that extra vitamin D
*  in addition to the prenatal with folic acid.
*  And what about women with PCOS?
*  I get so many questions about PCOS.
*  Inositol, yeah.
*  Inositol.
*  And there are we talking myoinositol or the,
*  what is it, the D-chiro?
*  Do I have that right?
*  You do have that right.
*  Myoinositol is the main driver of inositol
*  and how it can be helpful.
*  If you, most blends are going to have a combination
*  of both of them, but a much higher ratio
*  of myoinositol to D-chiro.
*  And so myoinositol is probably the one
*  that really is doing the work in PCOS.
*  What is it doing?
*  It is definitely helping the body
*  when it comes to insulin and sugar,
*  helping the body be more sensitive to insulin
*  or less resistant to it,
*  essentially helping you respond to what you eat
*  in a better way.
*  And it also looks like it does potentially decrease
*  some of that inflammation pathway.
*  In PCOS, this insulin resistance correlates
*  with this testosterone production from the ovary,
*  meaning even metformin alone can decrease testosterone levels
*  based on some of the change that it has in the ovary.
*  Take note, men, so many guys taking metformin
*  or berberine thinking, oh, this is great.
*  I'm going to lower my blood sugar, mimic fasting
*  and live longer.
*  And then these are also the same people
*  who are writing to me, go, how come when I take metformin,
*  I either have headaches,
*  essentially hypoglycemic,
*  but also their testosterone levels are getting crushed,
*  not in every case, but it happens.
*  And I think those are things people just don't think about.
*  They read that a supplement might be beneficial
*  for this one thing that doesn't apply to them
*  and they start taking it.
*  Also the evidence on metformin extending life,
*  we had Peter T on here to talk about this,
*  the evidence for that is like, oh, so poor.
*  It's just not really that convincing.
*  It may change, but then now all the excitement
*  is about rapamycin and so extending your life
*  while plummeting your testosterone,
*  I mean, actually that strategy has been tried
*  in the longevity community.
*  There was this whole castration idea.
*  Oh, I don't know this.
*  Oh yeah, this was like the Heaven's Gate cult
*  where they castrated themselves.
*  Did they live longer?
*  Well, they ended up committing mass suicide.
*  So no.
*  So they ended the experiment early.
*  Rightfully.
*  Yeah, so in any event, going back to supplements,
*  sorry, I couldn't help myself.
*  Supplements that women can potentially take
*  just to increase their fertility,
*  even if they don't want to get pregnant
*  as just kind of creating a milieu of health.
*  You talked about the nutrition, you talked about CoQ10,
*  maybe L-carnitine, vitamin C,
*  the essential fatty acids getting at least one gram of EPA.
*  So that might require taking two grams of fish oil
*  to get the EPA.
*  Myonositol, so how much are you talking about?
*  I've seen some pretty high dosages thrown out there.
*  For myonositol?
*  2000 milligrams.
*  Okay, taken before sleep, or does it matter?
*  That one doesn't matter, that one doesn't matter.
*  Thank you for covering the topic
*  of supplements and supplementation.
*  This is probably a good point
*  to return back to those harvested eggs.
*  So eggs are out and there's a collection of them frozen.
*  Maybe, just maybe, they're always alive, sorry.
*  Fresh sperm, they call them fresh sperm.
*  They're not always alive.
*  Some portion of the ejaculate is gonna be dead sperm,
*  some live, some for motile, some non-for motile.
*  The twitchers, I read is the name of the-
*  I hate those twitchers.
*  Right, the, and so, okay, they're gonna wash the sperm.
*  Why?
*  Because yeah, most of what people see as ejaculate or no,
*  excuse me, as ejaculate is not actually the sperm, right?
*  Okay, so, but sperm are washed, they're in one compartment.
*  You get the eggs out, you or your embryologist
*  at your clinic is then going to,
*  at some point, decide to combine them.
*  So is it kind of, is it a sperm race
*  or are you, maybe you could explain ICSI?
*  And why would one want, why would one opt for ICSI?
*  And are there any risks with ICSI?
*  Because there, you're really, at some level,
*  this is the only place where I kind of sit back and,
*  okay, as somebody who, you know,
*  is to eat neural development,
*  like at some level you're saying,
*  hey, that sperm looks good.
*  Whereas when you run a sperm race, nature is saying,
*  hey, this sperm really did beat all the other sperm.
*  So let's segue first, because I think this is nice,
*  because the question I get asked all the time
*  when we talk about nutrition and supplements
*  and all of that is to now you're doing IVF
*  or you're freezing your eggs.
*  And what if, what behaviors are good or bad?
*  Of course, all of those same ones are,
*  but about how long do you need to do them?
*  And this is why if you live healthy most of the days,
*  it doesn't really matter because that's how you're living.
*  But we already know the sperm cycle is about 90 days
*  and the eggs, I like to say, even though they're in the vault,
*  they become, they start lining up,
*  getting ready to exit the vault
*  and become more susceptible to the things you're doing
*  in that 90 day window.
*  And we know that to be true as well.
*  So they start to be pre-selected
*  for who's coming out the next month.
*  They start to line up.
*  And so making these changes as you start thinking
*  about getting pregnant, doing fertility treatments
*  is still extremely beneficial.
*  People will often say, well, I haven't been doing that.
*  So why start now?
*  It's not gonna make a difference, but truly it can.
*  I'll drink up until the week.
*  Until the day up, right?
*  I'll just get it in the entire time.
*  Like I'm gonna have my two glasses of wine,
*  which actually equates to about six glasses of wine
*  when you measure out by the volume, right?
*  Right up until the week before getting pregnant
*  or something like that.
*  Yeah, but no.
*  So people always ask, what should I be doing?
*  It's these healthy behaviors and you should be doing
*  this whole time.
*  When we do IVF, and I'm gonna get to all the things
*  you just asked, but earlier you said,
*  well, how tolerable is it?
*  The truth is you're taking shots.
*  These are subcutaneous shots during the egg growth process.
*  So next to the belly button.
*  Yeah, next to the belly button, like how a diabetic
*  gives insulin a very small needle.
*  I mean, nobody loves shots, but they're not a big
*  intramuscular shot.
*  It's not like a flu shot or something like that.
*  Listen, I've been to Austin.
*  The Texan mosquitoes hurt way worse.
*  They hurt way worse than one of these needles.
*  Exactly.
*  You're gonna use those medications for about 12 to 14 days.
*  You're going to have your follicles grow.
*  You're going to feel that.
*  So you're gonna have pelvic pressure.
*  As your estrogen rises, you're also going to third space
*  your fluid, which means your fluid, your water component
*  of your blood is going to start to just eek out
*  a little bit and you're gonna get more bloated.
*  You're gonna have more water weight.
*  You're going to feel puffier and that is very common
*  just because of getting the eggs to grow.
*  You're gonna mentally be fine
*  because the female brain loves high estrogen.
*  So you're doing fine.
*  And that's one of the main concerns is how emotional
*  will I be and during this phase of the process,
*  people do great.
*  When we take the eggs out of the body,
*  it's about a 20 minute procedure.
*  It is usually done under IV sedation,
*  like propofol and fentanyl.
*  And we are watching while we drain those follicles
*  and get test tubes full of the eggs.
*  Do some people opt to not use any, say,
*  I hear the word fentanyl and I'm sure a lot of people
*  are like, wait, fentanyl crisis.
*  And obviously fentanyl is a drug that has its uses,
*  valid uses in the medical community.
*  Does anyone just kind of opt for just-
*  I mean, we have an anesthesiologist
*  who is really talking to the patients.
*  I mean, propofol is the base of it.
*  Certainly there's some patients who may want to avoid
*  narcotic usage and they use different strategies.
*  I mean, there was this huge, right,
*  the Retrieval's podcast came out from like
*  the New York Times doing a deep dive into a fertility clinic
*  in Yale where a nurse was siphoning off fentanyl-
*  For herself.
*  For herself and replacing it with saline
*  and giving patients saline.
*  This clinic did not do anesthesia-based propofol.
*  So they were supposed to just get fentanyl
*  and have kind of a less pain environment,
*  not a no pain environment.
*  And not just a few, hundreds of women reported extreme pain,
*  extreme pain through the procedure,
*  really speaks largely to pain not being taken seriously
*  when they went and found this out.
*  Whoa, what happened to-
*  I can't help but ask, what happened to this technician?
*  Well, I mean-
*  Yeah, they're trying to find fentanyl behind bars.
*  Yeah, I mean, but it's huge as far as to-
*  Wow, it's terrible.
*  I mean, I can't imagine doing-
*  I do this procedure like all the time, right?
*  I've done thousands and thousands in my career
*  and I can't imagine having people be in pain during it.
*  So, but it's important to know that some clinics
*  don't use IV sedation or they don't use propofol.
*  They don't put you to sleep.
*  Understanding what your clinic is using
*  is really, really important to set the expectations
*  or to know, am I going to be awake
*  or am I going to be asleep?
*  Can a patient ask you to what specific drugs
*  are you gonna give me to kill pain?
*  For sure.
*  And I mean, some clinics only do one.
*  Like I am not going to do a retrieval under no sedation.
*  Now, some clinics would allow that,
*  some clinics, that's all that they do,
*  but that's a huge piece of the puzzle
*  that you need to know if you're a patient,
*  are you going to be feeling pain, not feeling pain,
*  what's it going to be like?
*  I'll say most clinics use propofol and put patients to sleep.
*  And so you take a nice little nap for 15 to 20 minutes,
*  the eggs are retrieved from the follicles
*  under direct visualization, they're in test tubes,
*  you wake up and you're gonna feel crampy
*  and you'll get a period 10-ish days later,
*  but this is when you'll feel your worst
*  and this is just the one thing I wanna say
*  about tolerability of it.
*  Can you get pregnant in that time?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, and there's a case report
*  of an egg donor who was donating her eggs
*  and she had sex with her boyfriend
*  and because not every egg is always retrieved
*  from the follicles or some small ones could ovulate too
*  and she got pregnant with quintuplets.
*  Whoa.
*  Okay, so you have to really tell people
*  not to have intercourse, one, from an infectious standpoint
*  because we really are poking a pretty large gauge needle
*  through the vaginal mucosa into the peritoneal cavity
*  so we don't wanna introduce infection
*  but also for pregnancy and that time period
*  and if you got pregnant, your risk of what we call
*  ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome or OHSS is very profound.
*  So what is normally happening is after the retrieval,
*  your estrogen and progesterone are gonna drop,
*  you're gonna feel a severe PMS for lack of a better word,
*  so you'll be more emotional, you're still pretty bloated
*  until this all heals.
*  If you get OHSS, which is very uncommon in modern practice
*  but when you did fresh embryo transfers
*  for people who don't utilize some of the modern protocols,
*  this means that HCG continues to encourage
*  all those follicles to make estrogen and progesterone
*  and if you are pregnant, you're just gonna have
*  a constant yet exponential increase in HCG
*  and so this is going to get worse and worse.
*  So we really don't want people to get pregnant
*  in that time period.
*  So when, during that time period, should they avoid sex?
*  So is it in the few days before the extraction?
*  So typically I usually say it's from like day five
*  of your stimulation, okay?
*  So usually the earliest egg retrievals
*  are kind of around cycle day nine or 10
*  if somebody goes fast until your next period comes.
*  So that's usually about a three week time period
*  where we want you to abstain from intercourse.
*  So for the most part though, the more eggs you have,
*  the more you're gonna feel both this hormonal
*  and physical shift than the fewer eggs that you have.
*  So if you have a low egg count
*  and you need to do IVF or freeze your eggs
*  and you might do multiple cycles or rounds,
*  you're gonna tolerate it actually pretty fine
*  because you're not gonna have these huge shifts.
*  Physically you're gonna feel fine
*  and that's always a big concern.
*  When you mentioned earlier about different stimulation types,
*  people have this idea that things that are more natural
*  are better, right?
*  It's just like this human thought
*  that natural is good and synthetic is bad.
*  Naturally you ovulate one egg a month.
*  When we're trying to get eggs out of your body,
*  the success is determined by how many eggs I can get
*  and how young you are.
*  So it doesn't make sense in most circumstances
*  to do a minimal stimulation protocol,
*  meaning purposefully under stimulating somebody
*  by saving them money and medication costs
*  in order to purposely get fewer eggs
*  because their odds of getting the ultimate success
*  of what they want is going to be so much lower.
*  Is there, I don't want you to be in the position of,
*  I don't wanna put you rather in the position of
*  kind of like having to demonize your colleagues
*  in your profession, but I could see how there's
*  a pretty significant financial incentive
*  for people who are really desperate to have children
*  or who just simply might wanna have children down the road
*  to hear low stem is better.
*  We're talking multiple low stem cycles.
*  They might be even a fraction of the cost
*  of a full stem cycle, but then there are many, many more
*  low stem cycles. You got it.
*  You got it.
*  You can make a lot more money by doing things
*  that are not in the best interest of the patient.
*  And I mean, that's not uncommon in my field,
*  which is very sad, but it does mean
*  that because reproduction and IVF are so foreign and unknown,
*  so many people walk in blind,
*  not knowing if what they're being told really makes sense
*  for their situation.
*  There are a couple of situations
*  where minimal stimulation makes sense.
*  If you're only gonna make three eggs,
*  you're only gonna make three eggs.
*  I don't need all the drugs in the world
*  to tell your body to make three eggs
*  because there's only three.
*  And so that is a scenario where minimal stimulation
*  does make sense.
*  And then there's the scenario where
*  there's something called Invocell.
*  Has your research exposed you to this?
*  Invocell is a way to try to take IVF
*  into making it more financially accessible
*  for certain patient populations,
*  mainly people who don't ovulate,
*  like your very refractory PCOS patient
*  who doesn't respond to medication,
*  or who have tubal factor infertility.
*  So your fallopian tubes are blocked
*  because of chlamydia or endometriosis.
*  And we just have a problem here
*  that egg and sperm can't get together
*  because you're not ovulating or your tubes are blocked.
*  In Invocell, it's a device that is plastic.
*  And you can fit up to 10 eggs in it.
*  And there's a little middle chamber where the sperm can go.
*  And so you go through this IVF process
*  with the goal to only get eight to 10 eggs
*  because that's what fits in the device.
*  And then you put the sperm in the middle of it.
*  And then you put it inside your vagina
*  and you hold it in place with a diaphragm.
*  And the vagina is the right temperature
*  to incubate.
*  And so you incubate your embryos
*  in this little Invocell container inside your vagina.
*  And then five days later, you come in and we take it out
*  and we take the best embryo and we transfer it.
*  And you can do a fresh transfer
*  because you didn't make so many eggs
*  so your hormones weren't so high.
*  Do people like this procedure?
*  There's something that seems like,
*  yeah, like staying in proximity to the sperm and egg.
*  Like you're taking it home.
*  Okay, so I love this procedure in some circumstances.
*  And I see it applied often in the wrong case.
*  And that can be frustrating, right?
*  Cause it's still not cheap.
*  Even if it's cheaper than IVF,
*  it is still not inexpensive in any means.
*  And so patient selection,
*  like most things in this field are so important.
*  So let's just say, if you've had no,
*  like if the sperm's the problem,
*  then it's probably not smart to just presume
*  that the sperm and egg will be fine in there, right?
*  Like that might be a case where you really do need help
*  with assisted fertilization.
*  Or if you have unexplained infertility,
*  if we don't know why you haven't been able to get pregnant
*  because everything looks good on paper,
*  what if fertilization is the issue?
*  And these are circumstances where you pull out an Invocell
*  and there's no embryos
*  and you don't really know where it went wrong.
*  Was it the fertilization step?
*  Was it the growth step of the embryos in culture?
*  So you do have less data, notably I like data.
*  You can't do genetic testing.
*  And this isn't really a strategy that allows you
*  to freeze embryos for future family growth.
*  That being said, the young patient who's got great egg
*  quality, who might have really bad PCOS or tubal disease,
*  it can certainly allow them the opportunity for a child
*  at a lower price point when they still have many
*  reproductive years to finalize their family.
*  It also is a lovely option for people who need donor sperm
*  to conceive because the success rates with this are
*  so much higher than an IUI,
*  which is what a lot of people use an intrauterine
*  insemination or putting the sperm in the uterus.
*  So now we're able to improve this outcome.
*  So like our same sex couples or our single parents by choice,
*  if it's a single woman who's trying to become a parent,
*  then they need to buy donor sperm and go through the process
*  anyway, this often can improve that efficacy through
*  the process pending their age and other factors.
*  There was a study that was just really neat.
*  There was a lesbian couple and one of them,
*  the eggs came out of, and the other one incubated
*  the embryos and then the other one had the embryo transfer.
*  So, but it gave both partners a way to feel a little more
*  involved in the process, which I just think is always
*  a really cool way when you have these different options
*  with reproduction.
*  Seems also that it's a more of a three dimensional
*  environment.
*  I always imagined that the Petri dish is not approach,
*  is that so two dimensional compared to the body
*  and all these things that having done cell culture before
*  and cultured neurons and things of that sort,
*  like there's all these concerns about like the concentration
*  of CO2 and the thing, or God forbid if there's a fluctuation
*  and you have backup generators and things,
*  but in the electrical flow to the incubators,
*  that's disruptive.
*  Whereas the natural environment of the body,
*  even though it fluctuates in temperature,
*  it's I mean, this has evolved over tens of thousands,
*  if not hundreds of thousands of years to be the process
*  by which embryos are created.
*  So here's where I sort of default in my mind anyway,
*  to the kind of like, oh, like it seems more natural.
*  You're incubating in the more quote unquote
*  more natural environment.
*  But at the same breath, why are you having infertility
*  if you're an infertility patient, right?
*  So if you need donor sperm, you maybe don't have infertility
*  or if you have tubal disease, you have a very defined reason
*  why we don't think that there's this huge inflammatory issue
*  in your body or something unknown.
*  So again, I'll see it applied to people
*  who really are bad candidates for it based on their age
*  or based on their diagnosis.
*  And so it's not always better, but for the right patient,
*  I mean, I've had patients have babies that way
*  who otherwise may not be able to.
*  So it can really open up the door.
*  So that's the most minimal of the minimal stimulation,
*  right, then we have minimal stimulation
*  because you don't have many eggs,
*  so you don't really need that.
*  But for the vast majority of people
*  who go through egg freezing or IVF,
*  we are really trying to get as many eggs
*  as you potentially have.
*  Everybody has a different number, but whatever you have,
*  whatever that antral follicle count is for you
*  is what we're trying to get.
*  And that's what these combination of medications
*  is trying to do.
*  When the eggs come into the lab, if you have egg freezing,
*  very important to know is before we get
*  into the icksy discussion, the eggs are stripped
*  of their outer cells, which is called the cumulus.
*  That's what the sperm has to attach to
*  in order to fertilize.
*  In order to freeze the eggs,
*  those cumulus cells are stripped off, the eggs are frozen.
*  You have to do icksy.
*  So if we're gonna lead into this icksy conversation,
*  if you're freezing your eggs, you're having icksy
*  when you fertilize them.
*  So I don't want somebody to ever not know that
*  if that is what they are choosing.
*  And icksy is, you can tell us.
*  Yes, icksy stands for it's ICSI
*  or intracytoplasmic sperm injection.
*  It is taking a sperm that under the microscope
*  looks normal in shape and moves well,
*  and you're pulling it up into a little needle.
*  And you're essentially using a little laser
*  on the side of the egg or the zona pellucida of the egg,
*  and you're injecting that one sperm into that egg cytoplasm.
*  And you're picking that sperm on the basis
*  of shape, motility, you're picking what you think
*  is the best sperm in the batch, obviously.
*  Yeah, you're picking, I mean,
*  there's gonna be one sperm per egg,
*  so there's multiple sperm that are chosen.
*  But you're picking sperm that look like
*  they have the highest potential.
*  My understanding is that there's a range
*  from very low to potentially high,
*  but hopefully not high, of DNA fragmentation
*  in pretty much every cell of the body.
*  The cell is always repairing its DNA.
*  So when visually selecting a sperm for icksy,
*  it's based on morphology, shape, and motility.
*  Right, you can't see the DNA damage
*  inside the head of the sperm or the DNA itself.
*  Are we soon to have a technology
*  where you could actually get a dye
*  that could label DNA fragmentation and select?
*  Because I feel like so much,
*  when we talk about embryology,
*  not to get too far down in the weeds,
*  but the methods of selecting eggs and selecting sperm,
*  I mean, these are the same methods
*  that have been used in embryology since the 1930s.
*  Oh, this one looks good, that one looks good.
*  And the skilled embryologist can really develop
*  a real talent over time of knowing what correlated
*  with healthy pregnancy and an offspring.
*  But I do like technology.
*  You would think that by now, 2023,
*  that someone would have some dye
*  that you could drop on the sperm and go,
*  well, like that one has a lot of DNA fragmentation
*  and that one doesn't.
*  I know, right?
*  There should be better ways to choose which sperm.
*  There's definitely, people are trying things.
*  Nothing has proven to be helpful so far.
*  There's definitely some interest in this
*  because we're starting to get more insight
*  as we have become better at embryo culture,
*  getting embryos to grow, doing genetic testing
*  on embryos to understand that that male genome
*  kicks in at day three.
*  And there's a subset of people
*  who have beautiful fertilization and embryo growth
*  day zero to three, and that's all on the egg.
*  And then as soon as that male genome kicks in,
*  you have this huge drop off in your embryo number.
*  And even some of this is in the context
*  of normal sperm parameters, right?
*  So things aren't really normal though,
*  or there's something underlying it.
*  Does that mean that every embryo failure
*  on day three post fertilization is sperm-based?
*  No, of course not, but it definitely means
*  that none of the ones before that
*  can be blamed on the sperm, and once after that,
*  there's definitely still maternal and sperm contributions.
*  We don't wanna create any couple disputes around this.
*  But it can be an insight when you're trying to look
*  through somebody's IVF cycle
*  about potentially modifiable factors, right?
*  Can you improve sperm quality
*  by some of these lifestyle measures?
*  I mean, the debatable thing about a DNA sperm fragmentation,
*  so what is that?
*  It is not a normal semen analysis,
*  but it is like that as far as it's a sperm sample
*  that is then sent off to be evaluated,
*  how much fragmentation or abnormal DNA
*  is in the heads of those sperm.
*  The studies have shown that people
*  who have abnormal DNA sperm fragmentation should do ICSI.
*  Okay, that's like the point of the study.
*  Now, ICSI has become very commonplace.
*  So ICSI, choosing the sperm to put into the egg,
*  originally didn't exist, right?
*  So what's the alternative?
*  Conventional fertilization.
*  This is having your petri dish, your eggs are on it,
*  you squirt your sperm, you cover it up,
*  you put it in the incubator.
*  Guys, she didn't mean you squirt your sperm.
*  She meant the embryologist.
*  The embryologist squirts the sperm on top.
*  Just to be clear.
*  And then pulls it out, and the next day sees
*  by which eggs and sperm fertilized.
*  Well, it's really devastating to pull out the dish
*  and have no fertilization.
*  And it definitely is a cause of infertility.
*  And it can be very hard to know that
*  because fertilization is not challenged
*  on a cellular level until you challenge it.
*  So ICSI used to be an add-on cost.
*  It used to be a separate thing
*  because it was harder to find embryologists who could do it.
*  It's so standard that a lot of clinics do it
*  the majority of the time,
*  purely because you often don't know all the variables
*  that are impacting fertilization,
*  and you're trying to give somebody
*  as many opportunities as possible.
*  ICSI has, in a lot of those original IVF studies,
*  got some of the bad reputation of being the problem
*  with why you might see that 1% rise of birth defects.
*  And so ICSI took the brunt from a lot of that.
*  We really don't see that when we're growing out
*  and we're doing freezing the embryos,
*  doing frozen transfers.
*  And I do ICSI in almost every patient.
*  I'm not gonna say in everyone, but-
*  Well, higher probability of success, right?
*  Higher probability of success.
*  And when you get to this point,
*  and so few people have insurance coverage,
*  so they're spending their money,
*  they're getting second mortgages, they're taking out loans.
*  If there's one decision that you say,
*  well, I don't know, you could have zero eggs fertilized,
*  or I could have the embryologist pick the best sperm
*  and put them inside the egg,
*  and we expect a 75% chance of fertilization,
*  that makes sense for the majority of people.
*  Yeah, that makes sense to me,
*  because I'm obsessed with data,
*  and the blood work fairly regularly,
*  not obsessively, but twice a year or so.
*  Now, I didn't always do that.
*  I actually did one of these DNA fragmentation tests.
*  They're pretty expensive.
*  They're in the- They are more
*  than a semen analysis.
*  Yeah, they're in the low,
*  they're sort of $1,200, $1,500 or so,
*  at least the one that I did.
*  It was very informative.
*  I was relieved to see not abnormal levels
*  of DNA fragmentation,
*  but I will say that based on everything you just said,
*  it seems like it might be the lower cost option,
*  because the alternative is to go through repeated cycles
*  of IVF and it's failing,
*  and that's certainly much more expensive.
*  It is, and I mean, I will say
*  that there is some current thought
*  by my urology colleagues, right?
*  So I'm not a urologist,
*  but definitely when I have a male
*  who needs a sperm extraction,
*  maybe he's had a prior vasectomy,
*  maybe he's got very low sperm counts,
*  and we're going in,
*  we're doing a sperm extraction procedure,
*  that potentially, if you have a patient
*  who has an abnormal DNA sperm fragmentation,
*  and even with ICSI,
*  has this drop off in embryo growth after day three,
*  because the sperm are still being made the same way,
*  right, are they still fragmented,
*  that potentially the ejaculatory process
*  could cause some of that fragmentation in certain men,
*  and that by going in and doing a sperm extraction
*  and not subjecting those sperm
*  to the rigors of ejaculation,
*  for lack of a better word,
*  could potentially lessen the fragmentation
*  and improve outcomes.
*  And I have some patients who we've gone down that road
*  and that has helped them.
*  Clear to say there's not a study,
*  that's not the point of DNA sperm frag,
*  is to try to distinguish if potentially ICSI
*  could be a helpful technology,
*  but a lot of doctors are offering or doing ICSI
*  because we want you to fertilize your eggs.
*  When they grow out in culture,
*  as we talked about IVF changing,
*  the metabolic needs of the embryo
*  change throughout the process,
*  and so embryo culture has become so much more successful,
*  but even in those best case scenarios,
*  we're looking at 50% progression.
*  So you're gonna have loss
*  throughout that culture process no matter what.
*  And you said 50% progression,
*  so half of the fertilized embryos
*  that make it past, let's say, day seven,
*  then they're screened for chromosomal abnormalities.
*  Then you've got, let's say, two or three of those,
*  maybe four, depending on how many eggs were harvested.
*  And your age.
*  And age, yes, thank you.
*  And then you said of those that are implanted
*  into, let's say, a woman, you're 45 or younger,
*  you're looking at about anywhere from 30% to 65%
*  successful implantation and pregnancy,
*  like healthy baby.
*  It's usually a 65% chance of live birth
*  if it's a genetically tested embryo.
*  That asterisk is the if,
*  and that's why you're gonna see
*  such varying IVF success rates
*  because if you don't do genetic testing of embryos,
*  let's use the 40-year-old who makes four embryos.
*  And I send them off for genetic testing.
*  I anticipate she has one normal embryo.
*  If I do genetic testing, which takes,
*  it's called PGT, pre-implantation genetic testing,
*  I am testing for aneuploidy as the traditional testing,
*  meaning does it have the right number of chromosomes?
*  You can also importantly test for single gene disorders
*  like cystic fibrosis or Huntington's.
*  But if we're just doing PGT for aneuploidy,
*  I expect an age-related proportion of your eggs
*  to be normal or abnormal.
*  So at age 40, I expect 20 to 25% normal.
*  So I can choose that one and put it in you
*  and have a 65% chance that you have a baby.
*  I could not do it.
*  I still have the same four.
*  That one is in there.
*  But if I go and transfer them each independently,
*  I'm now gonna have closer to a 20 to 30% chance of success.
*  So it is not that I'm changing the embryo by testing it,
*  but I'm allowing myself to have higher utility of success,
*  higher efficiency,
*  putting somebody through less failed transfers,
*  which is extremely important and less miscarriages
*  because those also take time.
*  And one of the most important things
*  is that you have the opportunity to understand
*  how many potential normal embryos you have
*  and batch cycles.
*  So you could go into another cycle because I'm 40,
*  I just met my person,
*  I really wanna have two kids
*  because my sibling is really important in my life.
*  Yet naturally, by the age I would be for that second child,
*  it's gonna be very hard to conceive.
*  I can go through IVF and batch some embryos.
*  So I could save two or three for that second baby
*  that I'm not gonna transfer for a few years.
*  And that's called embryo banking.
*  And that is changing the ways
*  that people can potentially grow their family at later ages.
*  But you don't know that
*  unless you know what's normal or not.
*  And it also gives you the chance to go
*  and intervene right now.
*  Because right now, especially if you're older,
*  I'm gonna have a higher chance of success
*  than if I am four transfers down the road
*  and maybe there was one miscarriage in there too,
*  we're suddenly now eight months down the road
*  before I can go do another cycle and get more eggs
*  versus if I found out
*  that none of those were genetically normal.
*  The average 40 year old might have zero to one
*  if they have average ovarian reserve per cycle.
*  So they're going to need multiple cycles.
*  It's not that it's impossible,
*  but it's just setting that road of expectation for them.
*  But if I don't get any normal embryos,
*  I can turn right around and go get more.
*  So I am using what's left in that ovarian vault each month
*  to try to get to that opportunity of a pregnancy for you
*  in a much more efficient way
*  by utilizing genetic testing of these embryos.
*  This is where we can put an ellipse in
*  and then sort of like dot, dot, dot, healthy baby, right?
*  And maybe in the future, if we're lucky,
*  you'll come back and talk to us about healthy pregnancy.
*  Love to.
*  And healthy baby onward.
*  That would be a fun and important set of discussions.
*  I would like to touch on the, I don't want to call it
*  the issue, but the topic of menopause,
*  which I assume is defined as the cessation of menses,
*  but there I'm guessing,
*  and I'm guessing it's a constellation of things that happen.
*  And I have a very straightforward question,
*  which is, is there an acceleration
*  of the onset of menopause?
*  Are we seeing that nowadays?
*  Are there good data on that?
*  Should people try to delay menopause?
*  What are some of the things that you talk to patients about
*  in terms of their considerations of ways
*  to ease that transition,
*  or maybe even offset that transition
*  with hormone replacement therapy or other approaches?
*  These are great questions.
*  And I do think this is going to be a huge interest
*  in upcoming years,
*  as we have learned more about the menopausal transition
*  and the health risks really associated
*  with being hypoestrogenic or having low estrogen.
*  Menopause, if we define it as ovarian failure.
*  So your ovaries now have no eggs or so few eggs
*  that they are refractory to the brain sending out FSH.
*  So your brain is sending out all the FSH and LH
*  that it can, your ovary is done
*  and not making any estradiol or progesterone anymore.
*  In this time period, what we know is one,
*  are we seeing a population-based increase
*  in earlier menopause?
*  There's not been a study to say that
*  observationally and clinically, I would say yes,
*  because I see so many younger women
*  having low ovarian reserve or having premature ovarian failure
*  or premature ovarian insufficiency,
*  which is the more politically correct way of saying it.
*  But when we think about what this is,
*  there are modifiable factors.
*  If running out of eggs is a variable,
*  and we already said certain things like smoking cigarettes
*  and exposure to toxins and likely chronic inflammation
*  and untreated disease, we know that having diabetes,
*  those things increase your risk
*  of going into menopause earlier.
*  So paying attention to the lifestyle that you have
*  when you're not concerned about your fertility, right?
*  When you're in your younger years
*  and maybe you're not worried about getting pregnant yet
*  or you're not worried about menopause,
*  but those choices that you're making in those time periods,
*  at least for women, your eggs are gonna hold on to them.
*  So they have an influence later.
*  Similarly, trying to live a lower inflammatory life
*  and getting sleep and avoiding toxins of which you can
*  is some of the best that you can do
*  to try to naturally prolong when you'll go through menopause
*  with the huge caveat that everybody is truly born
*  with a different number and you do not control that.
*  You don't.
*  And so you might have been born with a lower number
*  and you can't change that trajectory.
*  And you might have cancer and be exposed to chemotherapy,
*  which also will deplete your ovarian reserve.
*  But so do things like endometriosis,
*  especially if it's not being treated in any fashion.
*  So that's where we think the birth control pill
*  or progestin exposure or surgery,
*  ways to go and decrease the inflammation.
*  It's that inflammation associated with endometriosis
*  that's really causing these women
*  to have low ovarian reserve and go into menopause early.
*  So not only is that impacting fertility
*  and how many eggs you get
*  and how long you have to grow your family,
*  but when you go into menopause earlier,
*  you have lower life expectancy
*  than people who go into menopause later.
*  And that's why you even said earlier,
*  fertility is this variable kind of reflecting longevity
*  and like health overall.
*  So what we do know about menopause
*  is that having that low estrogen,
*  whether that happens at the average age of menopause
*  at 51, 52 or at an earlier time period,
*  it's not good for the brain,
*  higher risks of dementia,
*  increased risks of osteoporosis,
*  increased risk of heart disease and stroke
*  and essentially higher risks of death.
*  And that's not even to talk about the impact on your life,
*  what it can be like to have hot flashes,
*  heat and cold and sensitivity,
*  to have profound vulvar and vaginal atrophy
*  to the point that you no longer want to have intercourse
*  and the changes that it can even have on your gut
*  and your immune system.
*  So we as a community of doctors, especially OB-GYNs,
*  really recommend hormone replacement therapy
*  in women who are going through menopause.
*  And the key here is to initiate it right at the beginning.
*  That big Women's Health Initiative study,
*  which came out forever ago
*  and showed all this harm with hormone replacement therapy,
*  the big issue there was that these people
*  were hypoestrogenic for 10 plus years in one group
*  and then started back on the hormones.
*  And in that circumstance,
*  they already been put into this higher risk category
*  and their body had adjusted to not having the hormones.
*  And when re-exposed, they had more adverse events.
*  But if you are starting on estrogen replacement,
*  and it can be various,
*  but honestly the estrogen that we try to replace
*  in this time period much more mimics estradiol.
*  We have estradiol pills, you can have vaginal inserts,
*  you can have patches.
*  So it depends on what's gonna work for your life,
*  but it is not the birth control pill most oftenly.
*  In some people, it might be that's what they choose,
*  but we really are trying to pick an estrogen
*  that is estradiol more mimics that natural structure.
*  And you can't have unopposed estrogen
*  without reaching the risk of endometrial cancer.
*  And so that's why we need to have some progestin.
*  So some people will choose a daily progestin,
*  some will choose a cyclic progestin and still have periods.
*  Some will put in an IUD at this time period
*  and then take their daily estrogen.
*  There's a lot of different options.
*  We're trying to find the lowest dose of hormones
*  that relieves your symptoms to provide you relief
*  from some of these lifestyle issues,
*  but also helps you not just live longer, right?
*  We're not just trying to live longer.
*  We want to be healthy longer.
*  We want to have a better quality of life.
*  And certainly women's health has for long stopped
*  at this menopausal period.
*  And then it's been you're on your own kid.
*  And this is when we're really starting to see
*  that intervening at that place,
*  especially for women who go into ovarian failure early.
*  So those people who have low ovarian reserve,
*  who I diagnose, I tell all of them,
*  hey, if you don't freeze your eggs or I never see you again,
*  you're going to go through menopause early.
*  And when you do, I want you to go see somebody.
*  I don't want you to just ignore it
*  and suffer with these symptoms,
*  which is something that does commonly happen.
*  So just making sure that women are empowered to know
*  that these symptoms are what happens.
*  It's what happens naturally,
*  but by giving their bodies more estrogen
*  and not crazy high doses,
*  but just these physiologic levels can really improve
*  both the quality and the longevity of their life.
*  Is it just the presence of these symptoms
*  that signals the onset of menopause
*  or are there additional cues?
*  Like for instance, if their cycle is getting shorter
*  or longer.
*  You certainly will have cycle changes.
*  And we consider that the perimenopausal period
*  where you're starting to really start seeing a spacing
*  out of your period.
*  So they're no longer coming
*  at that perfect ovulatory pattern.
*  When you get into the low ovarian reserve,
*  but you're still ovulating regularly,
*  they first shorten as we said earlier,
*  but then when they start lengthening
*  or you start skipping months,
*  that's a real big clue that things are not going
*  in the right direction.
*  And if you find out you have very, very low ovarian reserve
*  or you're approaching that perimenopause period,
*  you're gonna start to have more prolonged periods
*  of low estrogen and you'll feel mentally cloudy,
*  fatigued, more headaches, more hot flashes,
*  lack of libido, those vulvar vaginal symptoms,
*  overall more likelihood to have depressed mood
*  and that's a lot.
*  That's a lot.
*  Well, Natalie, Dr. Crawford,
*  I want to extend a huge thank you on behalf of myself.
*  I've learned so much from you today
*  about fertility, about hormone health for women.
*  And you've also touched on a number of important issues
*  about hormone health and fertility for men along the way.
*  So it's truly been a masterclass in fertility and hormones
*  and really touched on topics that are so essential
*  to everybody, even if people aren't seeking to conceive
*  or maybe think they don't want to.
*  I mean, there's so many considerations
*  that really extend back to one's teens.
*  And if one is beyond their teens,
*  like whatever age people are, essentially,
*  they need to think about these issues
*  and make important decisions.
*  And you've really also clarified a lot of the,
*  what I think are quite destructive myths
*  that are prominent out there about, for instance,
*  egg harvest and what that does to one's fertility.
*  So first of all, thank you for joining us today.
*  I know you're extremely busy.
*  You run a clinic, you manage a family as well,
*  co-manage a family, I believe.
*  But this is the sort of knowledge
*  that is so challenging to find in one place.
*  And yet you also have a number of really spectacular avenues
*  that you deliver information, Instagram, podcasts, books,
*  and things of that sort.
*  We will refer everyone to those links.
*  I've learned so much from you over the years, really,
*  in following your content.
*  And today you've just like far exceeded
*  already high expectations.
*  So thank you ever so much.
*  Thank you for having me.
*  And just thank you for giving a space
*  to talk about women's health and fertility
*  and reproductive medicine.
*  It means a lot to me.
*  And it means a lot to the people
*  who really are trying to do their best every day.
*  So we appreciate it.
*  We appreciate you.
*  And with some luck, we'll commit you to come back
*  and talk to us about pregnancy
*  and a bit more on some of the topics
*  that we move through quickly.
*  Thank you. Thank you.
