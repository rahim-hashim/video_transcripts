# LIVE EVENT Q&A: Dr. Andrew Huberman Question & Answer in Toronto, ON
**Andrew Huberman:** [November 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eC9fiJBdMG0)
*  Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast,
*  where we discuss science and science-based tools
*  for everyday life.
*  Recently, the Huberman Lab hosted a live event
*  at the Meridian Theater in Toronto, Ontario.
*  The event consisted of a lecture entitled
*  the Brain-Body Contract,
*  followed by a question and answer session.
*  We wanted to make sure that the question
*  and answer session was available to everybody,
*  regardless of who could attend in person.
*  I also want to make sure to thank the sponsors
*  which were AG1 and 8Sleep.
*  8Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling,
*  heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
*  One of the key things to getting a great night's sleep
*  is to make sure that the temperature
*  of your sleeping environment is correct.
*  And that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep,
*  your body temperature actually has to drop
*  by about one to three degrees.
*  And in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized,
*  your body temperature actually has to increase
*  by about one to three degrees.
*  With 8Sleep, you can program the temperature
*  of your sleeping environment in the beginning, middle,
*  and end of your night.
*  It has a number of other features
*  like tracking the amount of rapid eye movement
*  and slow wave sleep that you get,
*  things that are essential to really dialing in
*  the perfect night's sleep for you.
*  I've been sleeping on an 8Sleep mattress cover
*  for well over two years now,
*  and it has greatly improved my sleep.
*  I fall asleep far more quickly.
*  I wake up far less often in the middle of the night,
*  and I wake up feeling far more refreshed
*  than I ever did prior to using an 8Sleep mattress cover.
*  If you'd like to try 8Sleep,
*  you can go to 8Sleep.com slash Huberman
*  to save $150 off their Pod 3 cover.
*  8Sleep currently ships to the USA, Canada, UK,
*  select countries in the EU and Australia.
*  Again, that's 8Sleep.com slash Huberman.
*  AG1 is an all-in-one vitamin mineral probiotic drink.
*  I've been taking AG1 since 2012,
*  so I'm delighted that they sponsored the live event.
*  The reason I started taking AG1
*  and the reason I still drink AG1 once or twice a day
*  is that it provides all of my foundational nutritional needs.
*  That is, it provides insurance
*  that I get the proper amounts of those vitamins,
*  minerals, probiotics, and fiber
*  to ensure optimal mental health,
*  physical health, and performance.
*  If you'd like to try AG1,
*  you can go to drinkag1.com slash Huberman
*  to claim a special offer.
*  They're giving away five free travel packs
*  plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
*  Again, that's drinkag1.com slash Huberman
*  to claim that special offer.
*  And now without further ado,
*  the question and answer session from our live event
*  at the Meridian Theater in Toronto, Ontario.
*  ["The Mirage"]
*  Okay, what motivated me to do the guest series
*  with Paul Conti?
*  Okay, so first of all, for those of you that don't know,
*  Paul Conti is a psychiatrist.
*  He's a Stanford and Harvard trained psychiatrist.
*  And I wanted to do the series with Paul for several reasons.
*  And we initiated that series.
*  First of all, he's incredibly talented as a clinician.
*  And yet, despite having written
*  an excellent book about trauma,
*  I felt that two things were true for sure.
*  One is that most people won't get the opportunity
*  to work with Paul, sadly, he's time limited.
*  And second, that his expertise is incredibly vast,
*  not just restricted to trauma.
*  Traumas, if understood, can be transmuted
*  into deep sources of knowledge
*  that other people can benefit from.
*  And indeed, what I found in Paul, as I got to know him,
*  is that he has just profound insight
*  into the unconscious mind.
*  And people had long asked me in and around the podcast,
*  what about the subconscious?
*  What about the unconscious?
*  And I was of the mind that the supercomputer
*  of the human brain is the forebrain.
*  The thinking, planning, context setting piece
*  right behind our forehead.
*  So it's the reason that we're not the house cats.
*  The house cats are the house cats,
*  and it's the reason we're the curators of the planet.
*  But Paul said, oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
*  the unconscious mind is the supercomputer of the mind.
*  I'm like, well, that sounds great,
*  but how do we understand the unconscious mind?
*  And he has a really biological and psychological
*  and psychiatric understanding of the unconscious.
*  And in that series, he talks about these so-called cupboards
*  that we can look into in order to better understand
*  our unconscious mind in order to allow our unconscious mind
*  to teach us things about ourselves that are useful.
*  And there are three main places where our unconscious
*  teaches us useful things that allow us to be more conscious
*  of the way that our brain is working in useful ways.
*  The first is in these liminal states
*  between waking and sleep.
*  It really does seem to be the case that when,
*  surprise, surprise, we're completely still,
*  and we're emerging from or we're dropping into states
*  of reduced autonomic arousal, but our level of thought,
*  if you will, is still active enough that we are aware,
*  maybe even lucid dreams, and also in dreams,
*  our unconscious mind uses, as I think Jung and Freud
*  pretty well understood, symbols to teach us things,
*  but everything's flipped in there.
*  Gender's flipped, just because you're having
*  a conflict with somebody in your life who's a man
*  doesn't mean that that person shows up as a man.
*  They could show up as an animal, so species are flipped.
*  The symbols become mish-mashed, but Paul made it very clear
*  that all this can be parsed if you do a certain kind
*  of introspective work, and I thought that would mean
*  a lot of talk therapy, that people would,
*  how are we gonna get people to learn
*  how to do talk therapy by themselves?
*  We wanna keep things as much independent of cost
*  and things like that, and the practices
*  he started talking about were incredibly simple.
*  Things like mirror work, some of the psychologists
*  in the room will be familiar with this,
*  I thought mirror work, what is that?
*  And he said literally, people trying to activate
*  their unconscious, or excuse me,
*  access their unconscious in sleep by a practice
*  of staring into the mirror for some period of time
*  while awake and reflecting on self and aspirations
*  and the idea of the body as a container,
*  all this stuff, even for a kid from Northern California,
*  sound really woo new agey, but here it's scripted
*  by Paul into a formal structure that one can use
*  to parse your own mental health and enhance mental health.
*  So that was the reason for doing the series,
*  and especially the episode on relationships,
*  not just romantic relationships, I found hasn't come out
*  yet incredibly interesting because he talked about
*  how in his clinical experience, virtually all the stuff
*  that people pay attention to in relational stuff
*  is are they a narcissist, are they obsessive,
*  is this person a musician versus whether or not
*  I'm an accountant, are we compatible,
*  that none of that stuff predicts anything,
*  as well as the balance of these three drives,
*  the aggressive drive, the pleasure drive,
*  and the so-called generative drive,
*  and I found it to be fascinating,
*  and I'm excited for that episode
*  and the other episodes to come out,
*  but basically because Paul's brilliant,
*  and he makes the, what I consider pretty obscure
*  and opaque, very clear and concrete,
*  and they're a bunch of worksheets,
*  again, all available at zero cost,
*  and none of them requiring that you do therapy
*  with anybody if you choose not to,
*  this is all the kind of work one could do on oneself,
*  and the last thing I'll say about this is,
*  and I should have said this first,
*  is that the primary motivation was we did a series
*  of Dr. Andy Galpin on physical fitness,
*  why isn't there a series on mental fitness, right,
*  like what is that, why do we talk so much
*  about mental health when we're,
*  and it's usually a conversation about mental illness,
*  what people should have tools and practices
*  that are zero cost, I believe,
*  to be able to introspect in a structured way
*  and enhance their mental health,
*  independent of their level of income,
*  and I think Paul was the guy to do it,
*  and we'll do more of that with other people as well,
*  because no single episode about any topic or series
*  can exhaustively cover any topic,
*  although Lord knows we will try.
*  Okay, next question.
*  What are the recommended protocols and best practices
*  to enhance emotional resilience
*  and develop effective responses
*  during highly triggering situations?
*  You're asking the wrong guy.
*  Um.
*  Ha, ha, yeah.
*  I mean, I don't snap, I don't snap,
*  I was a wild teenager, but I don't snap,
*  I'm not the aggressor, but I do have a snap button,
*  and it's been pushed before,
*  and I have to say when that happens,
*  it's really kind of a scary thing, not to me, right?
*  And it's been many years,
*  but I think anyone who's hit that threshold
*  where you just try not to say something,
*  you say it anyway, you know,
*  that's usually how it shows up for people.
*  I think we hear the statements like,
*  be responsive, not reactive.
*  That's why I became a biologist,
*  because stuff like that makes no sense to me.
*  In that moment, how are you responsive, not reactive?
*  So to me, I was like, what are the tools?
*  Clearly, as you go up that continuum of autonomic arousal,
*  it becomes much harder to do whatever that means, right?
*  So that, hence the tools for reducing stress in real time.
*  I think the one that we haven't emphasized
*  so much on the podcast,
*  and by the way, thanks to some great therapy
*  that was not voluntary, I was able to,
*  I was a wild kid, a wild, wild kid,
*  hung around with wild kids,
*  and things were pretty different then,
*  and we worked it out.
*  But I think nowadays it's wonderful,
*  because I think people are more conscious
*  of the need to understand their nervous system,
*  their own psychology.
*  That wasn't as common back then.
*  In fact, I hid the fact that I had to do therapy
*  for a long time, thinking, wow,
*  like everyone's gonna think I'm crazy.
*  They did call me crazy.
*  I think things have really changed.
*  I think the last 20 years have brought about
*  a profound shift in the way that we think
*  about our own species and what are useful tools
*  and practices, and I think that one of the things
*  that is abundantly clear is that that threshold
*  for a stress response really is different
*  for different people, different in different situations,
*  but that it is something that can be practiced and elevated,
*  and in terms of not getting near that trigger point,
*  through the types of practices I talked about earlier,
*  getting more comfortable with adrenaline circulating
*  in your system is what it's really about, frankly.
*  But of course, it all starts with a good night's sleep,
*  it's gonna make you far less reactive,
*  but of course, when you're stressed,
*  that's often when you're not getting good sleep.
*  So I think that ultimately, that our ability to,
*  more emotional resilience and effective responses
*  during triggering situations is really the consequence
*  of practices of taking good care
*  outside of those situations.
*  And then of course, inevitably, there will be situations
*  where people get triggered, and it's actually interesting
*  to see the way that people behave online
*  and the fact that many people, in fact, in science as well,
*  have literally lost their jobs for having,
*  not being able to control their thumbs.
*  It's kind of, we're in an odd time
*  where there's the distancing of doing things online
*  as opposed to in person where people somehow engage
*  in saying things and doing things
*  that they wouldn't in person.
*  But I think that ultimately,
*  it's the consequence of good self-care.
*  And this gets actually back to some of the things
*  that are covered in the Conti series.
*  We hear about self-care as we think that means massages,
*  which are great, by the way,
*  and we think that that is about exercise
*  and that's wonderful, but much of self-care
*  is about really making sure that our nervous system
*  is in the state that we need it to be in
*  in order to go about our day.
*  And I think this is why morning routines and practices
*  are so vital.
*  I think that those set the stage
*  for the emotional resilience.
*  Those set the stage for avoiding getting triggered,
*  so to speak.
*  I don't think there's a lot that one can do in real time
*  except perhaps physiological size.
*  So sorry to give you a sort of empty answer.
*  I'm not a pessimist on this front,
*  but I think that ultimately it's like saying,
*  well, what if you have to scale the side of a building
*  to get in and you locked yourself out?
*  What can you do to prepare for that?
*  Well, you can buy a ladder,
*  but if you don't have a ladder,
*  what you probably should do is be physically fit enough
*  to climb up a railing or something like that
*  and know how to pick a lock or something like that.
*  So I think ultimately that it's the consequence
*  of stuff that's done away from those triggering situations.
*  Next question, please.
*  How would you describe the brain activity
*  of somebody when they're suddenly inspired
*  and having foster inspiration in your life?
*  Well, I talked a little bit about this,
*  but I will say that the best way to foster inspiration
*  is in the words of the great Joe Strummer.
*  They actually call it Strummer's Law, no joke.
*  No input, no output.
*  I think one of the things that I've observed
*  over and over again is that as much as we need
*  to dedicate ourselves to our craft,
*  to our families, to our friends,
*  that ultimately our best ideas come from disparate experiences
*  when we're not seeking a particular kind of input
*  to get ideas.
*  Now maybe this practice of being completely still
*  while being alert fosters a lot of,
*  I think the way I understand it is more of a geysering up
*  of stored information in the unconscious.
*  So I think Rick would talk about it
*  or Paul Conte would talk about it
*  as geysering up from the unconscious
*  because when we are focused on the outside world,
*  we're taking in sensory information,
*  exteroception as opposed to interoception.
*  Of course that external sensory information,
*  that no input, no output,
*  is that those are the raw materials
*  that our nervous system uses
*  to construct ideas about anything.
*  So my belief, and this is a practice I do every week,
*  is I make sure that at least once a week
*  I either walk or hike or run without any earphones
*  and I'm trying to get into states of wordlessness,
*  states where I'm not digesting a podcast,
*  where I'm not reading a book,
*  where I'm not listening to a lecture,
*  where I'm not in conversation
*  and essentially trying to turn off the linguistic narrative.
*  We are a storytelling species.
*  We tend to take all of our internal and external experience
*  and construct things around language
*  but spoken language is not the language
*  of the nervous system.
*  The language of the nervous system
*  still remains to be identified.
*  It's something else.
*  For people that think in fields,
*  it will certainly incorporate that.
*  Spoken language, of course, is important
*  and we have some core structures to spoken language.
*  We covered this in the podcast episode
*  with my friend Eddie Chang.
*  But ultimately the way to come up with new ideas
*  of inspiration is going to be to collect
*  the raw materials of experience
*  and then give ourselves these periods,
*  maybe even just five, 10 minutes,
*  you have to lay around half the day
*  doing nothing, still wide awake,
*  and give those raw materials the opportunity
*  to marinate and combine in whatever ways
*  that are unique to you and then to geyser up.
*  What inspiration looks like in the brain,
*  we don't really know.
*  There's awe.
*  There's some studies about awe but that's different.
*  The word that better comes to mind is delight.
*  In my mind is something that we witness
*  that sort of overwhelms our attention.
*  Like wow.
*  Delight is when it somehow links up
*  with our own internal narrative.
*  Like I have something to do with what's happening.
*  I'm not just here to witness it.
*  Fireworks show, really impressive fireworks show
*  is like awe.
*  But there's nothing to do about it.
*  It doesn't relate to anything about you really.
*  You're purely a spectator.
*  Whereas delight is when you see something
*  and it somehow links to something in your emotional
*  or personal history or how you're wired.
*  That now there's something to do about it.
*  That's inspiration.
*  And we don't understand where that exists in the brain
*  or what that looks like.
*  But I think we all recognize that feeling when it happens
*  and it's oh so wonderful.
*  Okay, next question please.
*  How can Canadians fight the seasonal depression?
*  Winters are too long here.
*  Okay, well.
*  Well this gives me an opportunity to share with you
*  what I think is one of the coolest things about our species.
*  Notice I say that about many things.
*  So we've talked about circadian rhythms, right?
*  Sunrise as sun sets.
*  And we get that information transmitted
*  into our nervous system by looking at the sunrise.
*  By the way, you don't have to watch the sun
*  cross the horizon.
*  It just needs to be low solar angle.
*  Low in the sky.
*  Once it's overhead, it's a different signal.
*  So low solar angle, that's what it's about.
*  It's not necessarily about seeing the sun cross the horizon.
*  By the way, someone the other day on my team said,
*  wait, won't you get cataracts if you look at the sun?
*  Low solar angle sunlight is very unlikely to cause cataracts
*  especially if you're just doing it 10 to 30 minutes.
*  That solar, the sun overhead is when it's quite bright.
*  Yes, indeed some people are going to be at risk for cataracts.
*  So ophthalmologists in the audience
*  can attack me for that one.
*  But it was our chair of ophthalmology at Stanford
*  that said it, so I'm going to trust him.
*  OK.
*  That's circadian, 24 hour rhythms.
*  But there's also these circannual rhythms.
*  So if you're at a fairly northern location on the planet,
*  nights get very long, days get short in winter.
*  What happens then?
*  Well, melatonin, the hormone of darkness,
*  is essentially obliterated by light, by sunlight.
*  So what's happening when days are 12 hours long,
*  you have very little melatonin, the duration of the melatonin
*  signal is very short.
*  Then as you proceed into the fall,
*  days are getting shorter, nights are getting longer,
*  the duration of the melatonin signal
*  is getting longer and longer.
*  Then, of course, in winter, there's a lot more darkness.
*  Melatonin signals are very long.
*  Daylight signals are very short because the days are short.
*  So you could say, OK, well, that's obvious.
*  Thank goodness.
*  But what that means is incredible.
*  What that means is that you have a hormone, melatonin,
*  that's secreted from your pineal gland, which Descartes
*  called the seed of the soul, because there's only
*  one of them in the brain.
*  I don't know how he came up with that one.
*  But the pineal secretes melatonin,
*  and you suppress melatonin secretion
*  with sunlight viewing.
*  There's a couple of synapses in between the eye and the pineal,
*  but it gets there, up through the neck, basically,
*  the cervical ganglia.
*  What's wild, therefore, is that the location of the earth
*  around the sun and the tilt of the earth
*  is translated into a neural and then a hormonal signal
*  in your brain, which to me is amazing.
*  That literally means that the position of the earth
*  around the sun and its tilt are translated
*  into a physiological signal that's working unconsciously
*  to tell your brain and body what time of year it is,
*  but it doesn't care what time of year it is.
*  It cares about where you are in this orbit about the sun.
*  So if you think about when days are, say,
*  eight hours long in the fall versus eight hours
*  long in the spring, what's different?
*  What's different is how long the signal was the day before.
*  So the seasonal depression we now know
*  is the consequence of the melatonin signal getting longer,
*  not an absolute duration of the melatonin signal.
*  In other words, in the spring when a day is eight hours long,
*  but yesterday, the day was seven hours and 48 minutes long,
*  your brain has a memory of how much melatonin
*  was released the day before, much more,
*  than that particular day.
*  So it's a slow integrating clock.
*  So this is a very roundabout way for me to teach you
*  about the melatonin seasonal rhythm cycle
*  and answer the question directly by saying,
*  if you want to offset seasonal depression,
*  what you want to do is extend the amount of bright light
*  that you're getting in the morning slightly
*  as days get shorter.
*  But it's the extension of the bright light exposure,
*  and if you can't do that with sunlight
*  because there's no sunlight
*  because you live in Toronto, not Toronto,
*  what you want to do is find some artificial source
*  that you can look at in the morning
*  before you leave your home.
*  And I haven't talked much about this on the podcast
*  because our listeners are extended around the globe
*  and not just in Northern locations,
*  but what this essentially means is getting maybe
*  two to three minutes of bright light exposure
*  as you're heading from fall into winter,
*  bright light from an artificial source.
*  You do not need to purchase a so-called sad lamp,
*  one of these very expensive seasonal effects
*  depression lamps.
*  What I did was I purchased,
*  because I'm very sensitive to seasonal changes in light,
*  even though I don't live very far North,
*  is you can get a 900 lux drawing tablet.
*  These are quite inexpensive.
*  They're not zero cost, but quite inexpensive.
*  And just put that on your desk
*  or wherever you make your coffee in the morning,
*  90 minutes after you wake up, this sort of thing,
*  and just get five or so minutes before you leave the house.
*  And then as you extend into the winter,
*  you don't have to be neurotic
*  about increasing the duration every day.
*  You could actually, the way these slow integrating clocks
*  work, you could actually even just hold it
*  a little bit closer each day.
*  Don't burn your eyeballs out.
*  A little bit closer each day.
*  But essentially, if you just dose yourself
*  with a little bit more bright light early in the day
*  as you extend into winter,
*  that will essentially trick the melatonin system
*  into thinking that you're going from eight hours
*  into 10 hours of light, as opposed to eight hours
*  into six hours of light.
*  Okay?
*  Very simple.
*  And if you can't get one of these 900 lux tablets
*  or something off a website, then you could do this
*  with any bright incandescent bulb should work.
*  Again, just be careful not to put it directly
*  against your eyeball.
*  Okay, next question, please.
*  How do you increase the neuroplasticity?
*  Well, this is an opportunity to talk about something
*  I should have said earlier, which is that ultimately,
*  whether or not you are triggering neuroplasticity
*  through elevated focus or whether or not
*  you're taking high dose psilocybin,
*  your business, not mine.
*  And we could talk about psychedelics if you want.
*  Just decriminalized in California
*  or soon to be decriminalized.
*  Cool, people are enthusiastic.
*  Yeah, the one thing, I've been pretty vocal
*  about my belief that the data are really interesting,
*  to say the least, about not microdosing.
*  By the way, there's not a lot of evidence
*  that microdosing is useful.
*  I'm not saying it's not, but there are not a lot
*  of clinical trials showing that.
*  But the two macrodose with effective therapeutic support
*  trials are very encouraging, not just for major depression,
*  but also for various eating disorders,
*  alcohol use disorder, which is by the way,
*  the term that people are starting to shift to
*  as opposed to alcoholism or alcoholic,
*  it's not alcohol use disorder,
*  which is not to be politically correct,
*  we're just so we understand what they're talking about
*  when they're talking about alcohol use disorder.
*  Whether or not psilocybin, whether or not it's MDMA,
*  whether or not it's frustration brought about
*  by your inability to play an instrument
*  and your determination to do so,
*  in the end, it's all about deployment
*  of these neuromodulators.
*  Neuromodulators being some combination
*  of dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine, or epinephrine,
*  again, usually in combination.
*  What's very clear is that the neuroplastic effects
*  of MDMA, the neuroplastic effects of psilocybin
*  are brought about by huge increases in serotonin.
*  This also can help us understand why for some years,
*  and to some extent still now,
*  it was thought that the SSRIs,
*  the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
*  would be good treatments for depression.
*  I think some people, by the way,
*  have experienced tremendous relief from the SSRIs.
*  We don't wanna demonize them.
*  At the same time, it's very clear that depression
*  is not simply low levels of serotonin.
*  That's also not true.
*  Hence why there's effective, in some people,
*  antidepressants like repryron that increase
*  dopamine and epinephrine and not serotonin.
*  The point here is that these neuromodulators,
*  as they're called, allow for what?
*  They allow for modulation of synapses,
*  which effectively allows for neuroplasticity.
*  I mean, ultimately, whether or not it's through talk therapy,
*  Kundalini breathing, high dose psilocybin, MDMA,
*  or the combination, which I think is called a hippie flip.
*  Never done them together.
*  I confess, never done them together.
*  But have done them.
*  With a clinician, by the way, in legal circumstances,
*  and not a lot, not often, that is.
*  It's very clear that it's opening windows for plasticity.
*  Now what's intriguing, if we're gonna just talk about
*  psychedelics for a second, is why a drug like MDMA,
*  which increases dopamine, which by the way,
*  MDMA is methylene-dioxy methamphetamine.
*  Don't let anybody tell you it's something there.
*  It's meth, it's meth.
*  But it's meth with a lot of serotonin thrown in there too.
*  But it's meth.
*  And it's clear that for the treatment of PTSD,
*  it holds promise.
*  It's not absolutely safe,
*  especially for people with cardiac conditions.
*  And if you're gonna go down that path,
*  you want and need a skilled guide.
*  And this is where I think the laws are really gonna have to
*  pay careful attention to who and what is a skilled guide.
*  And when it comes to psilocybin,
*  the serotonin increases what effectively causes
*  broader connectivity in the brain.
*  And what's interesting is that both of those drugs
*  increase plasticity mainly through increases in serotonin,
*  but working on very different receptors.
*  So they have different types and outputs of plasticity.
*  What's interesting to me is that,
*  because I'm a strong believer that children
*  should not be doing psychedelics,
*  nor should we be giving children psychedelics,
*  is that the increases in connectivity in the brain
*  that are the consequence of playing a musical instrument,
*  or ideally an instrument with others as a child,
*  mimic a lot of the broader scale connectivity,
*  so-called resting network connectivity,
*  that occurs when people take psychedelics as adults.
*  In other words, and I can't emphasize this enough,
*  and again, I failed at music miserably.
*  I'll tell you a story about that in a second.
*  But getting kids to play an instrument,
*  it's very clear improves their ability to learn
*  all sorts of things for their entire life.
*  It's just so, so important.
*  I don't really know what to do about this,
*  or who to shout at or talk to about keeping the arts active
*  in schools and physical education,
*  but the idea that we would just train kids in math
*  is just frightening, because if you want them
*  to be truly good at math and science,
*  you'd also have them play instruments.
*  By the way, when I was a kid, I played the violin.
*  My parents made me.
*  It was not the instrument I wanted to play,
*  and we have only one picture,
*  and they taught me the Suzuki method.
*  You're supposed to learn by ear, and there's one picture,
*  and all the other kids have their bows up,
*  and my bow is down, and I'm standing here on the stage,
*  and my fly is down.
*  And that, and literally the neighbor's dog howled,
*  and I quit after that concert, so I was traumatized,
*  but they showed me the picture.
*  My sister teased me relentlessly.
*  So neuroplasticity, figure out your choice way
*  to increase a neuromodulator, like serotonin,
*  or epinephrine, acetylcholine, or dopamine.
*  I honestly would not encourage pharmacologic
*  or psychedelic approaches as your primary entry point.
*  I really don't.
*  I think that there's a place for that
*  in certain circumstances,
*  but that would not be the primary entry point.
*  Next question, please.
*  What type of movement protocol do you recommend
*  for somebody who's working from home,
*  sitting behind the computer from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.?
*  Oh, okay, well, a couple things.
*  I mean, I can make all sorts of recommendations,
*  like get up early, and move,
*  or if you can take breaks and walk, this sort of thing,
*  but let's assume that all of that is kind of understood,
*  that there are certain forms of exercise
*  that we should all be doing.
*  I think now it's very clear,
*  based on the beautiful work of Peter Atiyah,
*  whose brother is in the audience, by the way, tonight.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  He's got a younger brother.
*  He's got a younger brother.
*  Can you imagine if Peter Atiyah was your older brother?
*  Can you imagine?
*  That'd be pretty cool.
*  I sort of adopt people as siblings,
*  because they don't know it, but I do,
*  but I just assume Peter was my older brother,
*  but it turns out he has a younger brother already.
*  And Peter's essentially hammered home the truth,
*  which is that we should all be getting
*  somewhere between 150 and 200 minutes
*  of so-called zone two cardio,
*  where we're walking a lot, or moving about,
*  where we can just barely hold a conversation.
*  I notice people in Toronto seem to walk a lot,
*  so that's great.
*  And then three days a week or so of resistance training,
*  and there are a bunch of other mobility things
*  that we should all do, so that we don't fall
*  and break our hips, because that's,
*  or another bone, because that's another way
*  that people really limit their health span and lifespan,
*  and so on and so forth.
*  But two things that can make being at a desk,
*  which I loathe, even though I like to learn,
*  I hate sitting still, you can do the standing desk thing.
*  I do that by stacking boxes.
*  The other thing that was interesting,
*  did anyone see this study out of the University of Texas,
*  I think it was in Houston this last year,
*  about the soleus pushup?
*  Did anyone see this?
*  This is pretty interesting.
*  So the soleus, this wider, flat muscle below
*  the gastrocnemius of the calf,
*  is a really unique muscle in the human body.
*  It's 1% of the total human musculature,
*  but it has an ability, what will assume be
*  for obvious reasons, to dramatically shift
*  fuel utilization in the body.
*  What they did in this study was they had people
*  who were sitting for three or four hours a day
*  just simply raise their heel.
*  Seems almost silly, right?
*  They called it soleus pushup.
*  When I called it that online, I literally got attacked
*  by the gym bros, telling me that's a seated calf raise.
*  Okay?
*  You know?
*  I mean, like, okay.
*  No wonder this whole bro science thing gets kind of,
*  you know, people get really aggressive.
*  They lift their heel, and they're pushing their toe down.
*  And some people think of it as bouncing the knee,
*  but it's really about pushing the toe down
*  and lifting the heel.
*  So they just simply had these sedentary people
*  do this heel raise.
*  And what they saw was that there was a dramatic,
*  highly statistically significant increase
*  in blood glucose utilization and reduction
*  in both insulin levels during that activity
*  and around the clock.
*  Really interesting.
*  What they were doing was mimicking some aspect of walking.
*  Now, is it as good as walking?
*  No.
*  But if you are stuck behind a, you know,
*  working from home, sitting behind the computer
*  from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., what they found was that
*  people getting into this unconscious pattern
*  of lifting their heel over and over
*  and shifting back and forth
*  mimicked a lot of the effects of walking.
*  It's not a replacement for exercise,
*  but the shifts in glucose and insulin output
*  and utilization, excuse me,
*  utilization and output respectively,
*  were very impressive.
*  And this group down at the University of Texas in Houston
*  is starting to incorporate this into people
*  who have limited mobility.
*  And it doesn't seem like other limb movements can do this.
*  There's something special about the soleus.
*  It was designed, in air quotes,
*  to be a muscle that's used repeatedly over, you know,
*  extended hours of time and that has this unique pathway
*  of heel utilization.
*  So is it going to cure obesity?
*  No, but if you're stuck behind a desk,
*  that would be something useful.
*  I have this little fidget thing.
*  I was too lazy to build one, but I found one online
*  for a couple bucks where you just,
*  when you stand at your desk,
*  you just kind of kick it back and forth.
*  Anyone seen these?
*  They look kind of cool.
*  Then you just kind of kick them back and forth.
*  Some people will treadmill at the desk.
*  I can't do that.
*  I can't do that many things.
*  But I also am still working on this one.
*  I can't quite do that.
*  Next question, please.
*  My morning meditation consists of, okay,
*  and then I think we're about out of time.
*  But yeah, so my morning meditation
*  is not really a meditation.
*  It's a perceptual exercise.
*  And that perceptual exercise has a weird name
*  because I gave it a weird name.
*  And I didn't intend to sound mystical.
*  And I don't want credit for it.
*  But I call it space-time bridging, but it's not that.
*  What it really is is that the,
*  to me, one of the most interesting things
*  about the nervous system is our ability
*  to orient in different time domains.
*  This gets a little bit abstract.
*  But we know from states of high stress
*  that we start fine slicing time.
*  We know this, right?
*  The world becomes like a slow motion video
*  because frame rate has increased.
*  As a visual, vision neuroscientist,
*  I can tell you that in my laboratory,
*  we were doing studies with virtual reality
*  where we can crank up people's level of stress
*  by giving them certain visual stimuli.
*  And then their ability to parse information
*  is clearly increasing in the time domain.
*  They're fine slicing, much in the same way
*  that when you look at a slow motion video
*  of somebody dunking a basketball
*  or something of that sort,
*  it's because the frame rate went up, right?
*  So when we are in high alertness states,
*  our frame rate increases.
*  When we're very relaxed, our frame rate decreases.
*  So if you're Rick Rubinning and you're lying there
*  looking at the sky,
*  your frame rate is probably slower
*  than if you're hyper-focused on, oh my goodness,
*  like you said, imagine a dreadful situation
*  where somebody sends you a text message.
*  Well, let's make it positive.
*  Somebody's having a child in your family
*  and you're like, is it a healthy,
*  are mom and baby okay?
*  Da, da, da, da, da, da.
*  I mean, seconds feel like minutes.
*  Minutes feel like hours because you're fine slicing time.
*  Okay, and then da, da, mom and baby are fine.
*  Okay, great, happy story ending.
*  Great, so when we're very relaxed,
*  we tend to bin time more broadly.
*  Now, it's also true that your visual system
*  and your perception of time are inextricably linked
*  such that if you close your eyes
*  and you focused on your internal state,
*  you are fine slicing time and the second hand,
*  if you will, is more or less,
*  the metronome rather is your breathing
*  and your heart rate combined.
*  When you open your eyes and you look at something
*  in your immediate environment,
*  when you move from so-called interoception to exteroception,
*  you start, your perception of time shifts
*  fairly dramatically and you now perceive time
*  according to, believe it or not,
*  the speed of images moving in your environment
*  relative to you and then as you look out further
*  onto say the horizon, you extend the time domain even more.
*  If you then imagine yourself kind of in the whole globe,
*  you extend your time domain even more.
*  So my morning meditation, if you will,
*  it's more of a perceptual exercise,
*  is to step through these different time domains
*  to close my eyes and focus on my internal state,
*  open my eyes and focus on something close by,
*  look a little bit further, look a bit further,
*  think about myself on the globe, the whole world moving,
*  so you're really extending your space domain
*  and then the time domain expands with it.
*  And this comes up when you see these little memes of,
*  anytime you're worried, just remember,
*  you're a little dot on a little blue dot
*  spinning in the universe, this kind of thing,
*  but you don't think that way when you're stressed,
*  you're thinking, I'm the blue dot,
*  you're the problem, whatever, I want that,
*  you're not thinking, so this perceptual exercise
*  is a way of training the nervous system,
*  my nervous system to shift deliberately
*  between these different time domains
*  and for me, it's been very useful
*  for improving task switching,
*  something that as you probably have noticed,
*  I'm not very good at.
*  I go into the trench, I don't leave the trench very easily.
*  So that's been very useful
*  and if you are interested in this in more detail,
*  there's a wonderful book called The Secret Pulse of Time
*  and there's a Hitchcock movie that's discussed in that book
*  which the movie is about 75 minutes long
*  and during the course of that movie,
*  the background actually includes rising
*  and setting of the sun and a bunch of different speeds
*  of movement and interplay between the characters
*  and your perception at the end of the movie
*  is that a much, much longer period of time occurred
*  because of unconsciously your brain was paying attention
*  to these circadian signals and these other signals
*  and absolutely fascinating, I'm in Hitchcock,
*  not a huge Hitchcock fan, but now I,
*  after seeing that, I was like, wow, that's genius,
*  he captured this space time thing,
*  what you see out the window is in one time domain,
*  in the room is a different time domain,
*  I won't tell you who killed who,
*  but it's very, very interesting
*  and so the point being that when your visual system
*  is up close, focusing on things up close or internally,
*  you're fine slicing, when you focus on things further away,
*  you're more broadly focusing and so on and so forth
*  so that's a morning meditation I do,
*  perceptual exercise only takes about a minute or so
*  and the other thing is that on the monitors,
*  they're flashing now, that was your last question
*  so I wanna just say a couple of things before we go,
*  first of all, thanks to all of you who stood out the night
*  for the long duration, I realize this stuff
*  is like nerdy detailed and there are a lot of other things
*  you could be doing with your evening and your time
*  and so I'm very grateful that you all came together tonight
*  for this, what I like to think was a discussion
*  and I also just wanna thank everyone
*  for your interest in the podcast,
*  it is a labor of love, I'm highly dependent on my team
*  for doing all of it, I don't do it alone by any stretch
*  but as much as it might seem like it's me
*  talking to all of you, it really is about all of you
*  that's the reason I do it and I'm ever so grateful
*  and I'd certainly be remiss if I didn't say
*  thank you for your interest in science.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  You
