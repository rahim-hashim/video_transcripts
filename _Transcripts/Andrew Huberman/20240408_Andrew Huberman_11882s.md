# Coleman Ruiz: Overcoming Physical & Emotional Challenges
**Andrew Huberman:** [April 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acgz0C-z-gc)
*  Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
*  where we discuss science
*  and science-based tools for everyday life.
*  I'm Andrew Huberman,
*  and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
*  at Stanford School of Medicine.
*  My guest today is Coleman Ruiz.
*  Coleman Ruiz is a former Tier 1 Navy SEAL Special Operator.
*  I think it's fair to assume that most of you
*  have never heard of Coleman Ruiz before.
*  And in fact, it was part of his former life job description
*  to be largely covert, such that only his family
*  and friends really knew what he did for a living.
*  He is, however, now living as a civilian.
*  And the reason I invited Coleman on this podcast
*  was essentially to tell us his life story,
*  which of course includes his time in the SEAL teams,
*  but includes so much more
*  that I'm certain is of value to everyone.
*  Today, Coleman shares with you his remarkable journey
*  from childhood through his teenage years into the military
*  and some of the things that happened
*  during his time in the military,
*  which then informed his post-military civilian life
*  and what it is to be a father, a husband,
*  and somebody who has experienced tremendous loss
*  at various stages of his life,
*  as well as tremendous triumph.
*  Indeed, if ever there was a life that could be framed
*  within the context of the so-called hero's journey,
*  it is the life of Coleman Ruiz.
*  Coleman Ruiz's life is one that embodies focus and pursuit,
*  family and friends and love,
*  all the things that we think of
*  in terms of having a rich life,
*  but also one that includes many unforeseen tragedies,
*  many unforeseen challenges, both internal and external.
*  Coleman also shares with a rare
*  and extraordinary degree of vulnerability
*  the extent to which challenges in life,
*  both external and internal,
*  have helped shape him as a human being.
*  What follows is a discussion that everyone,
*  male, female, young, or old,
*  and regardless of position in life,
*  is sure to derive tremendous benefit from.
*  Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize
*  that this podcast is separate
*  from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
*  It is, however, part of my desire and effort
*  to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
*  and science-related tools to the general public.
*  In keeping with that theme,
*  I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
*  Our first sponsor is BetterHelp.
*  BetterHelp offers professional therapy
*  with a licensed therapist carried out entirely online.
*  I've been doing therapy for over 30 years.
*  Initially, I started therapy because, well,
*  I was required to in order to stay in school,
*  but eventually I just decided to keep doing it
*  because I found it to be very beneficial.
*  There are essentially three things
*  that great therapy provides.
*  First of all, it provides a rapport with somebody
*  that you can trust and talk about all issues with.
*  Second of all, they can provide support
*  in the form of emotional support or directed guidance.
*  And third, expert therapy can provide useful insights
*  that you wouldn't have otherwise had access to.
*  In fact, I consider doing regular therapy
*  as important as working out one's body in the gym
*  or through cardiovascular exercise.
*  And with BetterHelp, scheduling and doing therapy
*  becomes extremely convenient.
*  They can match you to a therapist
*  that can provide those three things, excellent rapport,
*  support, and insight,
*  and they can do so on a schedule that matches yours.
*  If you'd like to try BetterHelp,

*  Again, that's betterhelp.com slash Huberman.
*  Today's episode is also brought to us by Maui Nui Venison.
*  Maui Nui Venison is the most nutrient dense
*  and delicious red meat available.
*  I've spoken before on this podcast
*  and with several expert guests on this podcast
*  about the fact that most of us should be seeking
*  to get about one gram of quality protein
*  per pound of body weight every day.
*  Not only does that protein provide critical building blocks
*  for things like muscle repair and synthesis,
*  but also for overall metabolism and health.
*  Eating enough quality protein each day
*  is also a terrific way to stave off hunger.
*  One of the key things, however,
*  is to make sure that you're getting enough quality protein
*  without ingesting excess calories.
*  Maui Nui Venison has an extremely high quality protein
*  per calorie ratio,
*  such that getting one gram of protein per pound of body weight
*  is both easy and doesn't cause you to ingest
*  an excess of calories.
*  Also, Maui Nui Venison is absolutely delicious.
*  They have venison steaks, they have ground venison,
*  and they have venison bone broth.
*  I personally like all of those.
*  In fact, I probably eat a Maui Nui Venison burger
*  pretty much every day.
*  And occasionally I'll swap that for a Maui Nui steak.
*  And if you're really on the go,
*  they have Maui Nui Venison Jerky,
*  which has 10 grams of protein per stick at just 55 calories.
*  If you'd like to try Maui Nui Venison,
*  you can go to mauinuivenison.com slash Huberman
*  to get 20% off your first order.
*  Again, that's mauinuivenison.com slash Huberman.
*  Today's episode is also brought to us by 8 Sleep.
*  8 Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling,
*  heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
*  Now I've spoken many times before on this podcast
*  about the critical need to get sleep,
*  both enough sleep and enough quality sleep.
*  When we do that, everything, our mental health,
*  our physical health, performance in any sports
*  or school, et cetera, all get better.
*  And when we're not sleeping well or enough,
*  all those things suffer.
*  One of the key things to getting a great night's sleep
*  is that your body temperature actually has to drop
*  by about one to three degrees
*  in order to fall and stay deeply asleep.
*  And in order to wake up feeling refreshed,
*  your body temperature actually has to increase
*  by about one to three degrees.
*  One of the best ways to ensure that happens
*  is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment.
*  And with 8 Sleep, it makes it very easy to do that.
*  You program in the temperature that you want
*  at the beginning, middle, and end of the night.
*  You can even divide the temperature
*  for two different people,
*  if you have two different people sleeping in the bed,
*  and it tracks your sleep.
*  It tells you how much slow wave sleep
*  and rapid eye movement sleep you're getting.
*  It really helps you dial in the correct parameters
*  to get the best possible night's sleep for you.
*  I've been sleeping on an 8 Sleep mattress cover
*  for well over three years now,
*  and it has completely transformed my sleep for the better.
*  If you'd like to try 8 Sleep,
*  you can go to 8sleep.com slash Huberman
*  and save $150 off their pod three cover.
*  8 Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, UK,
*  select countries in the EU and Australia.
*  Again, that's 8sleep.com slash Huberman.
*  And now for my conversation with Coleman Ruiz.
*  Coleman Ruiz, welcome.
*  Thank you, very excited to see you.
*  It's great to have you here.
*  I'm guessing most people are probably not familiar
*  with Coleman Ruiz, so let's start at the beginning.
*  Where were you born?
*  What was the context of your home life?
*  And maybe let's get up to maybe elementary school,
*  middle school, and whatever top contour
*  or deep details you want to get into.
*  We're all ears.
*  Okay, I'll bring us up to seventh grade
*  because I would say that was probably
*  the first big inflection point in my life.
*  I was born in New Orleans in a suburb called
*  New Orleans East, we call it.
*  And I have an older sister, two younger brothers.
*  My dad was a welder.
*  My mom was a dental assistant.
*  And we had a couple of boxers and dogs.
*  And we had a very modest, very modest upbringing.
*  I won't over dramatize it, but admittedly,
*  sometimes we got cheese from the lady across the street
*  who didn't want her welfare cheese.
*  And it was one of those.
*  I could tell my parents were fighting for every nickel.
*  And, but it was great.
*  I mean, my cousin grew up across the street from me.
*  He's exactly my age.
*  We had that, at least some of my memory, Andrew,
*  of it was, it was very pleasant.
*  I learned later that you forget a lot of things
*  in your childhood that were unpleasant.
*  But my initial memories when I started thinking
*  about this kind of thing, and as you and I have discussed,
*  getting professional help, and you started to learn
*  a little bit more about your childhood.
*  But I remember it being very pleasant.
*  You've told me about your background
*  and skateboarding and stuff.
*  We skateboarded the neighborhood.
*  BMX was a big thing when we were kids.
*  It was very much a rat the streets upbringing.
*  There was a park behind the neighborhood.
*  We would cut through the fence and go, this kind of thing.
*  I played football and baseball and very normal
*  in that regard.
*  I went to the neighborhood school.
*  And then in sixth grade, I went to what was my high school,
*  but it went fifth through 12th,
*  called Holy Cross High School in the lower ninth ward,
*  which that spot is now vacated because the school,
*  I went back after Hurricane Katrina,
*  the whole school had to be moved.
*  And I went there in seventh grade.
*  And it was a hellacious start.
*  I mean, it was detention after detention,
*  fist fight after fist fight and damn near.
*  Were you the instigator of those fights?
*  Probably some.
*  I definitely fell in with the wrong crowd initially
*  in that sixth and seventh grade years.
*  And I wouldn't say it was so extreme
*  that like it was complete mayhem,
*  but I was definitely on problem situation number, whatever,
*  when my parents were called in.
*  And it was kind of the last straw type thing.
*  And I got cut from baseball.
*  My grades were fine.
*  I was always a pretty good student.
*  It was just teenager shenanigans.
*  And then I went out for wrestling.
*  Can I just pause you for a second?
*  So on the violence part,
*  I have a little bit of experience with this,
*  but violence can come from trying to protect others,
*  instigating, it can come from the wildness,
*  just trying to see what it feels like, experimentation,
*  and any number of other things,
*  all the way to pure sociopathy,
*  which we know you are not and weren't.
*  Do you recall feeling something inside that inspired this?
*  Was it for attention?
*  Did it feel good afterwards?
*  Can you recall what it was about?
*  I think it was the wildness thing, Andrew, honestly.
*  It wasn't, I mean, I believe,
*  I don't have a malicious bone in my body.
*  Like we all have that in us.
*  Obviously my profession later in the military,
*  I was able to activate that and I feel like I still can.
*  And I was certainly able to in sports,
*  which is why that seventh grade year was really pivotal.
*  But even now, it's funny,
*  it's even funny you ask about the wildness because,
*  let me put it in movie terms,
*  like one of my favorite movie scenes of all time
*  is in the movie, The Town.
*  When Ben Affleck walks in the room,
*  Jeremy Renner is his partner, essentially,
*  and he walks in the room and he says,
*  we're going to hurt somebody.
*  I can't tell you where and I can't tell you when.
*  And he pauses and Jeremy Renner takes
*  maybe a three second pause and he says,
*  whose car are we taking?
*  He doesn't even ask.
*  You know, they're just wild
*  and excited about doing something wild.
*  I don't promote like going to hurt somebody, of course.
*  Were you the Affleck or the Renner,
*  Affleck, excuse me, or Renner in that?
*  I was, I feel like I was mostly the Renner.
*  Put it this way, if you have some good idea this afternoon,
*  like let's go fucking try this, I'm good.
*  I'm ready.
*  And I think it's just exciting.
*  You know, I hate rules.
*  I hate being told to do.
*  It's one of the things that was so frustrating
*  about the military.
*  The rules are in place for a reason.
*  They're written in blood.
*  I get all that.
*  But we're so constrained sometimes.
*  I think that was just all coming into fruition
*  that seventh grade year.
*  And I enjoyed going wild.
*  Like it was just fun.
*  And frankly, we weren't,
*  these fist fights and this trouble wasn't
*  like going to get some kid.
*  Those other kids wanted the wildness too, you know?
*  And so, but the school didn't want that.
*  And then I went out for wrestling that year
*  and I could put it all into the wrestling room
*  and it was awesome.
*  Before we talk about wrestling
*  and why it was so meaningful as a channel for you,
*  a little bit of neurobiology or else I wouldn't be
*  great Andrew Huberman.
*  There's a really interesting phenomenon
*  that one observes in both animals and humans,
*  which is that somewhere around adolescence
*  when the hormone surge begins.
*  But even before that, there's a phenomenon called dispersal.
*  It's very different than fighting per se
*  or sexual activity per se.
*  It's a literal dispersal from one's home environment
*  where animals are in animals a nest
*  in which animals and humans and we're animals after all,
*  start forging new environments in a very,
*  as you point out, chaotic way.
*  It's not organized.
*  It's a little nuts.
*  And biologists and neurobiologists in particular
*  have observed changes in neural circuitry that drive this.
*  So some of it's hormonal, but a lot of it is the brain
*  taking all this input that one has been exposed to,
*  sun, earth, food, others, social interactions,
*  and starting to essentially throw the different paints,
*  the different colors of paint together
*  and just trying things.
*  Some kids are more prone to this than others.
*  Certainly has a hormonal component.
*  Boys and girls tend to do this differently,
*  but they both do it.
*  And psychologists and neurobiologists see this
*  as a fundamental shift in our underlying circuitry.
*  So just a little bit of food for thought
*  to put what you just described in context.
*  With that said, tell us about wrestling.
*  I mean, Andrew, in many ways, like I said,
*  that was the first inflection point.
*  It was like immediate, I mean, immediate uptake.
*  Within a week, I knew this was my thing.
*  Maybe the first practice.
*  What do you think it was?
*  So when I was younger, my aunt and uncle,
*  when I was like seven years old,
*  they started taking me to road races.
*  And I'm sure, just running races,
*  I was one mile in 5K races when I was really small kid
*  for you to run.
*  Mm-hmm, to run with them.
*  They were into the road racing thing back in the day
*  when it was brand new, you know, the 80s.
*  I'm 48, so I was born in 75.
*  So I was seven, eight years old at the time.
*  And I was into, like, obviously, can I win this race?
*  I just, the pain of the effort was so comfortable.
*  And then, it's kind of silly,
*  but I won the PT competition
*  at the Boy Scouts thing in Audubon Park.
*  PT is physical training.
*  Yeah, physical training.
*  Physical training.
*  And so I won the whatever when I was young
*  in Boy Scouts or something.
*  And then it just snowballed.
*  Then I was just, the physical activity, still today is,
*  I mean, if someone said,
*  what are you really in love with?
*  It's that.
*  And so when I walked into the wrestling room,
*  it was so extreme compared to anything else I had ever done.
*  Football, baseball, whatever.
*  I never really liked any of those sports.
*  I played them all, but I didn't like them.
*  And always, my dad wrestled in high school and college.
*  And we were, you know, always rough and tumble
*  in that regard.
*  And I even have a couple of buddies in the teams, you know,
*  who obviously were college wrestlers.
*  There's a lot of wrestlers in the teams.
*  And people would always joke about how we're so handsy.
*  You know, our hands are always on each other.
*  And that was just a thing for us.
*  Like I loved the close contact.
*  I loved the fight of it.
*  What I really love about combat sports,
*  because I boxed in high school between wrestling seasons,
*  was the respect.
*  Tell me more about that.
*  You just don't have, there are some, of course,
*  like you can see guys hyping it up and doing their thing
*  in UFC these days, and that's totally fine.
*  But for the most part, if you have fighters of any type,
*  like in a setting, when they don't have to do, you know,
*  the stuff for TV and whatnot, they respect each other
*  because, and they respect the effort.
*  And because you know what it takes,
*  and you know how hard it is to face another man
*  in the middle of a mat with no equipment
*  and nowhere to run and no timeouts and no one to tap in,
*  that's extreme, you know?
*  And it may not seem like high school wrestling is extreme,
*  but as you just mentioned something about, you know,
*  development, when you're 14 and you're facing another,
*  that's the first time, is someone trying to take your life?
*  No, they're not, but it feels that way.
*  And then you go and you put in all these hours of training
*  and you don't eat during the week,
*  and you run stadiums or you run levies,
*  and you know, fireman's carries and all of it,
*  while you're not eating and making weight
*  and you're in the sauna,
*  and it's just a very tough thing to do, combat sports,
*  and I love the respect that it engenders
*  between the people who do it.
*  I think it was Sam Sheridan who wrote A Fighter's Heart,
*  an excellent book, and for anyone, male or female,
*  any age who's interested in the human spirit,
*  I recommend A Fighter's Heart,
*  because it's about the different fight sports,
*  but it's really about the path of self-discovery
*  that occurs in various martial arts.
*  And as you said, especially boxing is very gentlemanly.
*  You touch gloves, you start, then the bell goes off,
*  you go to your corner, sometimes people lose it,
*  bite off people's ears and things like that,
*  but for the most part, the sport is very structured.
*  As you were doing this, what was happening with school?
*  Did it help your academic studies?
*  Did it keep them more or less the same?
*  How did your family and your peer group
*  view what you were doing?
*  Were you considered strange for liking wrestling so much?
*  I mean, you're dieting, right?
*  You're a young male dieting
*  for purpose of sport and performance.
*  You're sitting in saunas,
*  you're wrapped in plastic bags, all this.
*  I mean, a good friend of ours,
*  who was also in the SEAL teams, once said to me,
*  he said, wrestlers are different,
*  and I think he meant different in quotes.
*  I think that's true.
*  You know, school, my grades immediately went up, Andrew.
*  It was like, oh my gosh, the discipline of all of it,
*  my grades were always better in wrestling season
*  than out of wrestling season.
*  Like when I was cut loose out of the structure,
*  then it wasn't good.
*  And between seventh and eighth grade and all that,
*  I didn't have any crazy shenanigans going on,
*  I wasn't gonna get kicked out of school, whatever.
*  I was doing normal stuff for the age, but.
*  So the fight stopped.
*  Totally, totally.
*  Because I could put it into,
*  I could put it into the wrestling space, you know?
*  And I think, I grew up obviously in New Orleans,
*  and I think, you know, down there,
*  it's baseball, football, basketball, wrestling is not,
*  I mean, I was lucky to wrestle in college at all,
*  because it wasn't like Iowa was looking to recruit me.
*  You know, they have plenty of people to recruit,
*  and they don't need any Louisiana wrestlers.
*  Although Daniel Cormier grew up north of the lake,
*  he was four years younger.
*  I was telling this to somebody, we don't know each other,
*  I'd love to meet him, super impressive athlete.
*  We heard that, hey, there's some kid up in the north shore,
*  I think is where he grew up, whooping everybody's ass.
*  His name's Daniel Cormier,
*  and then, you know, obviously the rest is history.
*  But the sport is not big in Louisiana,
*  which is all to say that we were kind of a unicorn.
*  We had, it was very odd at my high school specifically,
*  we had one coach, his son, either national runner up,
*  his name was Willie Gatson, Willie passed away.
*  I think his son ended up at Iowa State,
*  and within the last five or six years
*  was either a national champ or a runner up.
*  Willie, when I was in eighth grade, Andrew,
*  Willie was at my high school.
*  Like, I have no idea how Willie Gatson
*  ended up in New Orleans,
*  but we ended up with this cluster of wrestlers at that time,
*  with the right coaching,
*  and a few kids were going to junior college and coming back,
*  and wrestling in college and coming back,
*  and there were three or four guys,
*  I remember specifically in eighth grade,
*  because I started, at least in the junior high ranks,
*  I started to take off my second year.
*  These guys would abuse me in the wrestling room.
*  They were seniors in high school,
*  I was 112 pounds or 132 pounds my freshman year,
*  and they would just, in my eighth grade year,
*  and they would just abuse me.
*  Define abuse.
*  In all the legal, normal wrestling ways.
*  Like, there's the, wrestling gets broken up,
*  obviously by weight, you got the heavyweights
*  on one end of the room,
*  the lightweights on the other end of the room,
*  and the young kids stay with the young kids
*  for the most part,
*  and a few of these guys would drag me down
*  to the varsity end,
*  and I would wrestle with the middleweights,
*  and they would beat the shit out of me,
*  and eventually you get to the point
*  where you're like, fuck this, I had enough.
*  And that's when sort of things started to turn,
*  but I think that wrestlers are different,
*  and my peer group,
*  one or two of my really good friends wrestled,
*  but most of them played other sports,
*  and so,
*  but in every sense of the word,
*  life got better for me because of that sport.
*  It changed my life.
*  So you wrestled all through high school?
*  Oh yeah, yep.
*  At that point, were you discovering relationships, girls?
*  Were you partying?
*  Were you a drinker, used drugs?
*  No drugs.
*  I mean, it's New Orleans, right?
*  It's like one of the things that was tough.
*  I'm glad I got out of the city, frankly,
*  because it was party time outside the season.
*  Yeah, girls, girlfriends, normal stuff in that regard.
*  Lots of drinking, lots of rat in the streets,
*  in those days in the 90s.
*  But you kept it inside the lane lines.
*  Oh totally.
*  It sounds like no drunk driving, no arrests.
*  No.
*  We did a little bit of that,
*  but nothing crazy in that regard.
*  I think I understood the consequences,
*  and I really cared about my career.
*  I really wanted to wrestle in college.
*  My grades were excellent.
*  My SAT scores, not so much,
*  but I started winning really fast.
*  My last two years in high school, I was 89 and 0,
*  and I almost won my sophomore year.
*  So I was runner up in the state my sophomore year.
*  I always joke with the boys.
*  All my boys are way better athletes
*  than I ever could think about being.
*  Your sons?
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Right.
*  But in eighth grade, I made varsity,
*  and it was like, was it eighth grade?
*  Yeah, and I lost 75% of the matches.
*  But you just grind it out,
*  and it's how I got into the Naval Academy,
*  which is a whole nother story.
*  So let's talk about that.
*  So you finish high school.
*  You head to the Naval Academy.
*  Why the Naval Academy?
*  It's actually a crazy story behind this,
*  which maybe we'll circle back to.
*  But the summer, gosh, I had forgotten
*  that this started in seventh grade too.
*  The summer between my seventh and eighth grade year,
*  my grandfather was too young to join the Navy,
*  and he wanted to go to the Naval Academy
*  during World War II, and he lied to the recruiter,
*  and he got into the Merchant Marines.
*  His, I'm pretty sure, first cousin.
*  My uncle and my cousins are like
*  first cousins once removed.
*  My uncle Jim Therrell was at a family reunion in Mississippi,
*  which we were at, and he didn't mention the Naval Academy.
*  Family reunion ends, they all go home.
*  And he starts sending me Naval Academy paraphernalia.
*  I knew nothing about the military.
*  And I just thought about it, you know?
*  And he would send me stuff.
*  You know, you didn't, we didn't have the internet, right?
*  He's sending these booklets.
*  And you don't like authority.
*  No.
*  I have not been in the military,
*  but I've done some work with y'all,
*  and there's a lot of hierarchy and authority.
*  Yeah, that's true.
*  The truth, Andrew, is like it just seemed exciting.
*  I wasn't really thinking about the implications
*  as 18-year-olds, you know?
*  It looked very exciting to me.
*  And having gotten some professional help
*  in the intervening years,
*  what I really think was a big part of it
*  was my parents got divorced my senior year in high school,
*  and the family unit just blew up, right?
*  And so it also represented an escape, you know?
*  Get out and go get your life out of the New Orleans
*  and just go, just go do something.
*  Were you a part of that,
*  that obviously you were a part of the family
*  that got divorced.
*  Was it chaotic?
*  Was it controlled?
*  You and I are the exact same age.
*  We're both 48, born in 75.
*  Back then it was a lot less common for people being,
*  they called them broken homes back then.
*  Yeah, that's right.
*  Nowadays, I don't think they call it that.
*  Everyone just cites the statistic that, you know,
*  more than half of marriages end in divorce
*  as if perhaps to normalize it, but that's more than half.
*  Do you recall feeling distraught about that
*  or was it just kind of the natural consequence
*  of something you had observed a long time?
*  You're like, oh, that kind of makes sense.
*  No, it was a shock to me.
*  It wasn't a shock to my older sister.
*  I just remember, this was the thought at the time.
*  This was like seared in my brain.
*  This has nothing to do with me.
*  That wasn't like some sophisticated view.
*  It was mostly, fuck this, I'm not dealing with this.
*  I have my own life.
*  They're gonna have to do what they're gonna do,
*  meaning my parents.
*  I'm getting the hell out of here.
*  Not a bad mindset for a kid at that stage.
*  If it had been four years younger,
*  that might not be the best mindset,
*  but as you're heading off to college,
*  that's a reasonably healthy mindset,
*  as opposed to getting enmeshed in the,
*  what happened and this and that.
*  Can I ask you, at that stage,
*  so you're 17, 18 years old at that point,
*  were you journaling at that point?
*  No.
*  No, no journaling, no introspective work.
*  Zero.
*  No school psychologists.
*  No thinking about or talking about your feelings.
*  It's wrestling, Naval Academy, social things, school, SATs.
*  Like very standard, we're almost talking
*  like a superficial list of what happens
*  at the end of high school in 1992.
*  And Andrew, the word superficial,
*  and I carried this forward for years,
*  which I'm sure we'll talk about here in a second.
*  Those binary focus areas,
*  like I was literally just going after them at full steam,
*  stronger, faster, more intensity, with zero introspection,
*  no excavation of the psychology of anything.
*  Just full steam ahead, like let's go.
*  No meditation, no breath work.
*  Zero.
*  Which was not adaptive in the long run.
*  And we'll get to how that played out in the long run.
*  But nonetheless, you got into the Naval Academy.
*  Didn't first.
*  Okay.
*  So I applied.
*  I get, you know, my uncle's doing all this stuff.
*  Anyway, I applied and I didn't,
*  I still have the letter of the thanks, but no thanks.
*  You know, you're not qualified.
*  How'd that hit you?
*  At the time, it hit me kind of like everything I did.
*  When that age, when it didn't work out,
*  admittedly, Andrew, it was like,
*  there's gotta be a way around this.
*  Like shit has to work out.
*  But it feels terrible, right?
*  Like you have a moment of what do we do?
*  And my kids have heard the story a million times.
*  My wife was a blue chip swimming recruit for Navy.
*  And so she was into the Naval Academy
*  when she was at the beginning
*  of her senior year of high school, right?
*  What's a blue chip?
*  I mean, in my understanding, a blue chip is like,
*  you are at the very top of the list
*  and the coaches put you straight into the admission cycle
*  saying nobody else gets in until this person does first.
*  So they wanted her, they didn't want you.
*  Not only was she a blue chip and I got the no,
*  I guess, well, the wrestling coach called me
*  a couple of weeks after my no, which is now in May.
*  I'm about to graduate from high school.
*  I'm not accepted anywhere.
*  You only applied one place.
*  Actually two, which you may burst out laughing
*  when I tell you what the other one is,
*  because no internet.
*  Because no internet.
*  I got a mailer in a pamphlet from Stanford,
*  the wrestling coach.
*  I didn't know what Stanford was.
*  I had no idea that the college was even prestigious.
*  I didn't know they had a wrestling team.
*  I filled out the application and wrote the letter thing
*  and I sent it into Stanford, of course,
*  never heard back from them.
*  But I applied to two places,
*  Stanford and the US Naval Academy.
*  Well, for those that follow wrestling.
*  I didn't get into either.
*  That's a great story.
*  And I'll just briefly mention that a few years ago,
*  there almost wasn't a wrestling team at Stanford.
*  They had plans to cut the wrestling team
*  despite having a NCAA champion at Stanford.
*  But the power of people gathering and petitioning worked
*  and wrestling and a few other sports
*  that were being cut from the curriculum were spared.
*  It's amazing.
*  Or rescued.
*  So happy to see that.
*  Yeah, so Stanford does have a wrestling team.
*  So the coach, back to how I ended up getting in,
*  I appreciated my college coach called
*  and he said, I'm recruiting,
*  I have one more spot at the prep school,
*  which is in Newport, Rhode Island.
*  I'm recruiting another kid from Pennsylvania.
*  If he takes that spot, then I don't have anything left.
*  And we were exploring going to prep school
*  and stuff like that, oblique ways to get in.
*  And he called me sometime in May,
*  like right around graduation and said,
*  can you be in Newport in July?
*  That kid went to, I think he went to Lehigh
*  and I went to the prep school.
*  Newport, Rhode Island.
*  Yeah, in Newport for a year.
*  I've been there, it's a nice place.
*  Yeah, it's great.
*  And so you wrestle for, I mean, you do school,
*  you're in West Point as a prep school
*  and Colorado Springs as a prep school.
*  And so we joked that my wife was first person
*  in our class accepted and I was last.
*  Which is highly possible, actually.
*  I'd like to take a brief break
*  and acknowledge our sponsor, AG1.
*  By now, most of you have heard me tell my story
*  about how I've been taking AG1 once or twice a day,
*  every day since 2012.
*  And indeed that's true.
*  I started taking AG1 and I still take AG1
*  once or twice a day because it gives me vitamins
*  and minerals that I might not be getting enough of
*  from whole foods that I eat,
*  as well as adaptogens and micronutrients.
*  And those adaptogens and micronutrients
*  are really critical because even though I strive
*  to eat most of my foods from unprocessed
*  or minimally processed whole foods,
*  it's often hard to do so, especially when I'm traveling
*  and especially when I'm busy.
*  So by drinking a packet of AG1 in the morning
*  and oftentimes also again in the afternoon or evening,
*  I'm ensuring that I'm getting everything I need.
*  I'm covering all of my foundational nutritional needs.
*  And I, like so many other people that take AG1 regularly,
*  just report feeling better.
*  And that shouldn't be surprising
*  because it supports gut health.
*  And of course, gut health supports immune system health
*  and brain health.
*  And it's supporting a ton of different cellular
*  and organ processes that all interact with one another.
*  So while certain supplements are really directed
*  towards one specific outcome,
*  like sleeping better or being more alert,
*  AG1 really is foundational nutritional support.
*  It's really designed to support all of the systems
*  of your brain and body that relate to mental health
*  and physical health.
*  If you'd like to try AG1,
*  you can go to drinkag1.com slash Huberman
*  to claim a special offer.
*  They'll give you five free travel packs with your order
*  plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
*  Again, that's drinkag1.com slash Huberman.
*  So you're in Newport.
*  Does that have a portal to the Naval Academy?
*  Yeah, if you graduate prep school,
*  you're straight into the Naval Academy.
*  Like they fully expect you to be there the next year.
*  When junior year rolled around
*  and senior year rolled around of high school,
*  didn't anyone pull you aside and say,
*  hey, you might wanna like apply to a few other places.
*  You might wanna consider what you do
*  if this doesn't work out.
*  What did they assume you were gonna do?
*  They just head into the city of New Orleans
*  and bus tables.
*  Zero guidance, Andrew, really.
*  Like from my high school and I think
*  the ecosystem I was in,
*  like people just didn't really know how to do that.
*  You know, how to apply to schools.
*  I mean, my parents obviously helped
*  when I applied to the Naval Academy.
*  But when I look at the system that kids go through now
*  to go, you know, their process
*  to find the best college experience,
*  I never had one conversation with a guidance counselor
*  about what to do.
*  I just didn't.
*  I mean, I just got very lucky.
*  A few people, my high school wrestling coach intervened,
*  I think at some point,
*  and called the Naval Academy to speak to the coach
*  to say you should give this kid a chance.
*  But he didn't, they didn't know who he was, you know?
*  I'm so lucky and so fortunate
*  that I ended up where I ended up.
*  It's why I took it so seriously.
*  Like, the focus with which I applied my time
*  in high school, I took that to 10X degree
*  when I got to Newport because I knew this was my chance.
*  There's something magical to that.
*  I can relate to that.
*  So you're in Newport and describe what a day was like.
*  Is it all wrestling?
*  You're taking general education classes like one does
*  in the first two years of university?
*  Yep, so the way the prep school is set up
*  for the Naval Academies are basically teaching you
*  the first semester of the Naval Academy.
*  So you take calculus, physics, chemistry,
*  I think you take an English class, et cetera.
*  And you go through a pretty hellacious first couple of weeks
*  because you're away from the flagpole
*  where no one can hear you scream.
*  You know, you're up in Newport,
*  you're not in Annapolis where everyone's watching.
*  And you do a couple of hellacious weeks
*  for an 18-year-old who's never been in the military before.
*  So you're in the military technically if you go to this school.
*  You're actually enlisted in the Navy.
*  So they own you to some extent?
*  Yeah, yeah they do.
*  And then you do...
*  You're wearing uniforms, you jog it in the morning,
*  you're doing salutes and marching.
*  Yep, you have four-four.
*  You're bugling, they're doing taps in the evening.
*  All of it.
*  Got it.
*  Yep, and there's 300 people at the prep school.
*  It's distributed basically amongst folks
*  coming from the fleet.
*  So guys who did four or five years in the military somewhere
*  and they're coming into the Naval Academy from the fleet.
*  And then athletes and then sort of a mixture
*  of other folks who need a little extra school.
*  Right, and so, and then you do a full school year.
*  You're competing.
*  It's basically a redshirt year that's not a redshirt year.
*  I competed up and down the East Coast against
*  all the other prep schools and you finish that year in May
*  and then you're done with the prep.
*  The prep year is fine.
*  It's a little bit of a shock when you're 18, but it's fine.
*  I've always been curious about these military schools
*  and the people that go to them
*  and what happens to people there.
*  Did you have any sense of patriotism
*  prior to arriving at this prep school
*  and did that sense of patriotism,
*  I'm talking like love of country,
*  understanding the history of our country
*  and its position in the international landscape.
*  Are you thinking about that stuff?
*  Are they feeding you that?
*  Or is it really like wrestling, get through the march,
*  shower up, go to the next thing?
*  Is it very like plug and chug?
*  No, no, the feeding of, and I really appreciated this,
*  the feeding of those concepts starts when you get there.
*  But I was deer in a headlight.
*  I didn't think about my life in this way at all
*  when I was headed there.
*  I mean, what you get very early,
*  because the school very quickly starts to bring
*  really high level accomplished people,
*  colonels, admirals, whatever, generals,
*  to expose you to these people.
*  I do remember sitting there, within weeks,
*  like this is way bigger than I thought it was
*  in terms of how serious this situation is,
*  and how serious this ecosystem of people take this,
*  because I didn't have, my dad wasn't an admiral,
*  he was a welder in New Orleans.
*  I didn't understand the bigness of it.
*  One of the reasons I asked this
*  is that various times throughout my life,
*  I've had this experience of seeing people close to me
*  doing incredible work.
*  Like when I was a postdoc at Stanford,
*  Nobel Prize was given that one week
*  to the guy next door to me.
*  So you see him in the morning,
*  and you're hearing it on the radio,
*  and obviously I didn't have that kind of stature
*  or talent in science.
*  I think I'm a good scientist,
*  but good enough to get tenure at Stanford,
*  but then there are levels within the game.
*  But there is something very special to the experience
*  of having people close to you physically
*  and in the same ecosystem as you described it,
*  achieving amazing things.
*  I also saw this in skateboarding.
*  There were a lot of, let's just say,
*  failures to integrate with normal life,
*  but there were also some guys that I grew up with
*  who started companies and set world records
*  and had their pro models.
*  And then if you zoom out from that and you go,
*  wait, I'm in this community.
*  It changes one's self view about what's possible.
*  So I think that's what you're describing.
*  And I think it's such an important thing
*  for people to experience at some point,
*  even if the goal isn't to be at world scale.
*  And I think it's important for people to realize
*  that the town they grew up in,
*  the family they grew up in, that context can expand.
*  And so do you recall being at this prep school
*  and kind of third person yourself,
*  thinking like, well, I'm Coleman Ruiz,
*  I'm from New Orleans, I went from this to this to this,
*  the way you've been describing it, and I'm here.
*  And they were like,
*  I'm around some incredibly impressive people and I'm here.
*  Like once you make that recognition that you're there,
*  a whole bunch of things can open up.
*  Came at it from the opposite way.
*  And this has been a hard thing for me my whole life.
*  And I have to watch out for this perspective,
*  is I felt like every day I had to wake up
*  and earn my place there.
*  I was never good enough for myself ever.
*  So next day up is a restart to prove myself again,
*  on whatever standard I'm picking that day, right?
*  Looking back on it, I realize it was somewhat arbitrary
*  because it was just day by day.
*  I didn't think I'm Coleman Ruiz, I made it here,
*  look, I'm part of this.
*  I was afraid,
*  like Mike Tyson talks about being afraid every time,
*  I was afraid every day.
*  And I fought for
*  like a position in this place every day.
*  Now that was adaptive in some regard, right?
*  Very.
*  Because to me it was, let's go.
*  Like today's another new day and it's 100% all in, full go.
*  I hope everybody's ready.
*  Do you ever recall falling asleep at night
*  and thinking like, well like-
*  I had a good day.
*  I had a good day or I'm scared,
*  they're gonna discover I can't keep up
*  or I can't keep up.
*  All the time.
*  So a lot of fear, I mean.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, a lot of fear.
*  All the time.
*  And some of it I do, I genuinely know and believe in Andrew
*  that it was well intentioned.
*  I wanted to do a good job for the group.
*  Whatever group I was in.
*  My platoon, my squad, in the case of the prep school,
*  that first experience,
*  I was talking about this with my wife the other day,
*  just cause stories come up.
*  We had a 25th reunion at the Naval Academy
*  and this kind of thing.
*  I was a really good runner for my group in high school,
*  like the people I was around.
*  I ran cross country when I was younger.
*  Anyway, I did, I suppose I'm going the other way,
*  I sort of did have some level of confidence in my ability.
*  Then I got there and all these college
*  cross country runners, like my son is now,
*  just crushing me.
*  And I think, sadly, because it was just sort of in me,
*  that fed my fear.
*  Like, shit, I thought I was better than this.
*  Clearly I suck.
*  I have to get to their level.
*  So I did have a very well intentioned excitement around,
*  just do a good job with the people you're around.
*  There's something fun to that and wild,
*  as we spoke about.
*  But I was operating out of fear for decades.
*  But there was a, I need to get to their level statement
*  in there.
*  It wasn't, I can't keep up, I better find a different path.
*  No, no, no, no.
*  I knew I could get to their level with enough work.
*  Was that something that your father or your mother
*  or both had instilled in you?
*  Oh, for sure.
*  Yeah.
*  And my high school wrestling coach was,
*  let's call it, maybe from the old school.
*  If you worked hard enough, you could get there.
*  So this is the essence of growth mindset,
*  long before Carol Dweck coined the phrase growth mindset.
*  It's there, I'm not there yet.
*  When I first read her book, I'm like,
*  when people teach us to shit when we're kids.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, some of us got it, some of us didn't.
*  And it can be very context dependent.
*  I think that's one of the more important
*  and often overlooked aspects of Carol's work
*  and Ali Crum's work is that we can develop growth mindset
*  in one domain of life, but then another domain of life,
*  we get kicked in the teeth once and we're like,
*  I can't do that.
*  There's a carve out where I can't function.
*  Some people do that, some people don't.
*  And we don't understand enough about it
*  to understand whether or not it's a global circuit.
*  And there's a lot of context.
*  But okay, so you're hanging in there at least,
*  you're surrounded by some very impressive people.
*  There's a lot of structure.
*  So we're a long way from the pre-wrestling days.
*  Oh yeah.
*  This is the opposite of chaos.
*  Totally.
*  This is structure.
*  You're told what to do every five minutes more or less.
*  And this is scary feelings, fear is a scary feeling.
*  But you're channeling it and you said the unit of the day
*  became important.
*  It's like, what can I do today?
*  Yes.
*  You're not thinking about the week,
*  you're not thinking about the season,
*  you're not thinking about becoming some war hero,
*  down the line, you're just 24 hours.
*  Do the next day.
*  How was your self care at that point
*  or is that built into the system?
*  It's not built into the system and it was zero.
*  I mean, it really was Andrew, like it was the old school.
*  We were not doing anything sophisticated back then.
*  I mean, there's no, we stretched.
*  And in the grand scheme of things,
*  this is gonna sound weird because there still is a lot of
*  primal nature to combat sports.
*  But in the grand scheme of things,
*  we were probably on the upper end of sophisticated,
*  like wrestlers jump rope, they stretch, they do aerobics.
*  Been in a sauna since 1993.
*  It's like not purposeful, not to cut weight in a garbage bag,
*  but there is some level of balancing out your training.
*  Wrestlers like to swim during the season
*  because you're getting out of that hot room.
*  Like you end up accidentally doing some of these things,
*  but there was no self care.
*  So you eventually go to the Naval Academy.
*  94.
*  The actual Naval Academy,
*  and that's where you met your wife.
*  Yep, in 96, my sophomore year.
*  So when you get there,
*  what's different than the prep school?
*  First of all, it's big in the macro,
*  not just geographically big or footprint,
*  square footage wise, it's big.
*  The concept is big.
*  The superintendent of the school is a three star admiral.
*  You hear about his career, you're 19 years old, you meet.
*  So there's two incredibly important people in my life.
*  In those early years at the Naval Academy.
*  A guy named Doug Zembeck who's dead now,
*  who most people of my service time will know who he is.
*  When I was on my recruiting trip to the Naval Academy
*  and I was in high school, this is complete accident.
*  Doug was a sophomore.
*  We call him youngsters at the Naval Academy.
*  He was a sophomore and we're the same weight class.
*  So coach matched us up because it was my recruiting visit.
*  And my first, this is back to being wild.
*  Literally my first night on the grounds
*  of the Naval Academy, I'm sleeping on Doug Zembeck's floor
*  of his room with his other two roommates.
*  And sometime around three or four a.m.
*  I get woken up, it's like a bomb goes off.
*  There's a bomb didn't go off,
*  but there's 12 other gorillas in the room, all wrestlers,
*  maybe one or two other guys.
*  And Doug is hustling, I don't know any of these people.
*  Like I just met Doug the previous evening,
*  we just flew into town.
*  He wakes me up, he's hustling me to get my shoes on.
*  Again, I'm just this high school kid.
*  And then within two to three minutes,
*  all 15 of these gorillas bolt out of the room.
*  And Doug grabs me and I'm just following them.
*  So we race out of Bancroft Hall,
*  it's maybe four in the morning, 3.34 in the morning.
*  We race out of Bancroft Hall, the barracks,
*  we run across the parking lot into Lejeune Hall.
*  And Lejeune Hall is the swimming facility
*  and the wrestling room.
*  That's it, that's the only thing that's in there.
*  The doors, we run up to Lejeune Hall.
*  The doors of Lejeune Hall are locked
*  with a chain on the outside.
*  And one of our, Doug pulls on the chain
*  so that the door is open enough at the top
*  that the 142 pounder can climb up
*  and get inside that little gap in the doors
*  and run over and open one of the doors that isn't chained.
*  This is what you'll later do professionally.
*  I still have, exactly.
*  And what I frankly did as a kid back in the day.
*  And so I'm terrified because I don't know what's coming.
*  And so you don't bother to ask, what are we doing?
*  There's no time, there's just no time.
*  These guys are, to me, they're full blown war heroes.
*  They're college kids, but I'm 17, they're 21,
*  all these wrestlers, I'm hoping I'm gonna come here
*  and be their teammate, you know?
*  We run into Lejeune Hall, go to the second story.
*  We climb up the utility ladder where Public Works goes
*  to get in the ceiling above the white,
*  foamy ceiling tile things.
*  So we're now on the catwalk
*  where the HVAC guys would be working.
*  And I'm starting to get a sense of what's coming.
*  We go a couple feet down the catwalk,
*  everyone stops, someone reaches over the catwalk
*  and pulls one chalky ceiling tile out.
*  So now you can look over the edge of the catwalk
*  and see right through the ceiling into the diving well.
*  Remember the diving well has a 10 meter platform
*  and then we're another, I don't wanna over exaggerate this,
*  we have to be another 20 feet into the ceiling.
*  So you're above the diving board.
*  Most people are called that.
*  We're above the diving board.
*  We're five feet above the ceiling,
*  which is 20 feet above the 10 meter.
*  Got it.
*  Right?
*  And so, and now I've realized what's happening.
*  And two or three wrestlers, they sort of,
*  you climb over the catwalk, get backwards,
*  get your hands all the way down
*  and then very lower yourself in a reverse pull up
*  so you don't kick the ceiling tile.
*  And three or four guys go and you can hear them
*  hit the water after what is a terrifyingly long time
*  when you're my age and scared.
*  In the dark?
*  Oh yeah.
*  No one's supposed to be in there.
*  And then one of the guys looks over.
*  When you're a recruit, you're called a drag.
*  And they're like, drag you're up.
*  And I'm lowering myself, Andrew,
*  and I kick the adjacent ceiling tile
*  and it hits the dive tank and it turns into pancake batter
*  and goes to the bottom of the pool.
*  And one of my teammates is like, you motherfucker.
*  One of my future teammates, you know, he's going nuts.
*  I drop, I live, and this is back to Doug.
*  I come up, Doug clearly goes behind me,
*  but I don't hear him.
*  And one or two guys are going nuts,
*  you high school piece of shit,
*  like you're gonna go down to the 15 feet and pick it all up.
*  And Doug comes up and he just blasts everybody.
*  He's our responsibility.
*  This is not his fault.
*  We brought him here.
*  Like just totally backs me up.
*  And then the rest of the visit happens.
*  I end up there, Doug's no, senior, I'm a freshman.
*  And he's just the legend.
*  He was an all-American.
*  And to this day, Andrew,
*  you need to hear this loud and clear.
*  Like for all the people you and I both know
*  and the people I've been around,
*  no other human in my life have I met
*  with his physical and mental toughness, not even close.
*  The guy was born in the wrong century
*  is the way I describe him.
*  And he was like my mentor and he was my guy, you know?
*  And he was killed in 07.
*  Marie, we'll talk about Doug.
*  You've written about him.
*  He's unbelievable.
*  I feel like I know him a little bit thanks to you.
*  We'll get around to that for sure.
*  I think people are getting a sense of where we're headed.
*  So that's the, to answer your question about like that,
*  the bigness of the Naval Academy,
*  that's how it started for me.
*  Like everything was just on steroids,
*  all these kinds of people.
*  I get the impression, at least up until now,
*  that you're kind of just,
*  you just go with what's right in front of you.
*  100%.
*  There isn't a lot of pause and reflect.
*  Although your rudder is not haphazard.
*  It's not random.
*  No.
*  Well, yeah, I can say right now,
*  you and I are as similar as, you know,
*  we may be in certain respects,
*  like we're very different in this way.
*  Like there isn't a foraging.
*  You know, in biology, we call them random walks.
*  You know, a lot of organization that comes out of biology
*  is through random walks,
*  like animal or human like finds a node and moves.
*  And life is like this.
*  Steve Jobs talked about not being able to connect the dots,
*  except in retrospect, and I subscribe to that.
*  And his life was a bit of a random walk,
*  but that we're guided by some central beam of uniqueness.
*  Robert Greene, when he was on the podcast,
*  talks about that.
*  Your beam is more narrow, it seems.
*  And the propeller behind that beam is high RPM.
*  That's very clear.
*  And what I'm not hearing here is like,
*  yeah, you know, at one point I paused
*  and wondered whether or not I wanted to, you know,
*  be here wrestling in the Naval Academy,
*  or even like what I might do when I get out.
*  Am I gonna work for an investment firm?
*  What am I gonna do?
*  Your horizon, it seems to be about 24 hours at that point.
*  Yeah, I hope not anymore, but at that point,
*  no, at that point, at that point.
*  I mean, I'm no psychologist,
*  but it just seems like you're,
*  it's not like you're playing checkers,
*  but you're optimizing for a fairly short horizon.
*  There's no question that's right.
*  And the other part that was probably the most important
*  to me, Andrew, was the person or the group,
*  because this is gonna sound very arrogant,
*  but when I got to, I'm going to this prep school,
*  I'm going to the Naval Academy.
*  I think on day one, I'm gonna literally meet
*  the cream of the crop in the country.
*  And that was not the case.
*  And it was not the case at the Naval Academy.
*  And frankly, it wasn't the case in the teams either.
*  Like I'm not saying I'm better than anybody,
*  but I thought every single person
*  when I got to the Naval Academy
*  was gonna be entirely focused on whatever our mission was.
*  And I didn't even know what my mission was there, right?
*  I just knew I was gonna be told what Wright looks like.
*  And Doug, not only did I meet him in high school
*  and have the luck of having him as a teammate and a mentor,
*  for me, he is what Wright looked like.
*  So a focused beam and a propeller running at high RPM
*  with the right quote unquote swim buddy, so to speak,
*  was literally all I cared about.
*  That was it.
*  Everything else was white noise.
*  Were there other interests at the time?
*  I mean, presumably you listened to music
*  every once in a while.
*  But I mean, whatever.
*  But didn't fall in love with it.
*  Didn't feel the need to pursue anything else,
*  learn an instrument, do anything else.
*  It was that narrow beam.
*  So you met your wife in 96.
*  Sophomore year at the Naval Academy, yep.
*  And was she as driven?
*  Is she as driven?
*  I mean, she's obviously a very talented swimmer.
*  Presumably works hard as well.
*  Kind of interesting.
*  I didn't realize until a few years ago
*  that both of you are military.
*  Yeah, she definitely just different, different driven,
*  way smarter, way more.
*  You know, it's obviously not one to one for men and women,
*  but way more successful by gradient standards.
*  She's in the Navy Hall of Fame.
*  She was Patriot League swimming champ.
*  She was on junior national triathlon team
*  when she was 20, I think.
*  Really talented in every regard.
*  Ninth in our class, I think.
*  First female graduate, number one female graduate,
*  our class.
*  Tell me more about that.
*  How's that work?
*  You have a, I don't even know exactly how the grading,
*  first of all, her grades are,
*  her academic success is just remarkable.
*  And then you get a military grade
*  and you get a physical grade, not for your athletics,
*  I don't think, but it's like your PRT scores,
*  which is your physical readiness test,
*  all this military stuff you do.
*  You get this other cluster of a grade
*  that goes along with your academic grades.
*  And she was number nine in the class
*  and the first female graduate
*  based on that cluster of grading.
*  And I mean, she's an amazing person.
*  Was her success in academics and swimming,
*  was that part of what drew you to her?
*  No.
*  No, no, she was just nice and, you know.
*  I didn't really care about the achievement.
*  It doesn't, it certainly sounds like I care about achievement
*  because of the narrow focus, but it wasn't really that.
*  You know, she was just really normal
*  in a group of a lot of abnormal people, frankly.
*  Like there's some kooks at these schools, you know.
*  And I'm probably in that category, I don't know,
*  but everybody's just really different there.
*  You have this athlete group, you have, I mean,
*  you know, Andrew, I mean, you went to Stanford.
*  I mean, some of the, you know,
*  the group of Naval Academy and West Point,
*  like these schools who produce
*  like the Rhodes Scholar level person,
*  like that cluster of group, like at Navy,
*  I remember they're super impressive.
*  I mean, and then there's the rest of us like doing our best,
*  getting pretty good grades and stuff,
*  but there's very different groups inside, you know, the school.
*  Yeah, yeah, I looked at some of my colleagues,
*  like a former guest on this podcast, Ali Crum.
*  You know, she's incredible scientist,
*  was a division one gymnast
*  and is a licensed clinical psychologist.
*  Also maintains a healthy relationship
*  with children in the home.
*  Amazing.
*  I just go, who are these people?
*  I mean, you know, every once in a while,
*  we talk about the person with the quote unquote extra gear,
*  you know, like some people just seem to have
*  that extra gear and I don't want to take anything away
*  from Ali or anyone else's incredible work ethic
*  that goes with what people perceive as an extra gear.
*  Who knows if they have an extra gear or not?
*  I always just want to know what their parents did.
*  Yeah.
*  And it turns out Ali's parents, I hope I have this right,
*  but recollection of this is that
*  her mother ran a theater group
*  and her father was a martial arts teacher.
*  Okay.
*  So, you know, there's nothing that speaks
*  to academics per se.
*  And I find that really important to me and to highlight
*  because I think people hearing this conversation
*  and hear about people like Ali's and other examples
*  like that, you think, oh yeah, you got to come
*  from an academic family to end up at a top tier institution
*  or to win a Nobel prize.
*  In fact, there are so many exceptions to that
*  or you have to be a natural athlete
*  or be born with some genetic gift
*  or some extra gear as it were in order to succeed.
*  But I think so much of success is the thing
*  that you seem to operationalize really quickly
*  which is to really focus on that 24 hour horizon
*  and where one has seen failure to just keep going.
*  I mean, a big part of it is just to keep going.
*  But also to make sure that you're continuing to go
*  in a direction that is adaptive and functional
*  because imagine had you not found wrestling
*  and you had gotten into some group where the metrics
*  of success were around, you know, dealing weed
*  or doing something which back then was highly illegal,
*  now is varying levels of legality.
*  But you know, where the points came back for effort
*  in domains of life that could take you down into the gutter.
*  And you see this.
*  So I'm convinced that the work ethic
*  is the fundamental piece, but there has to be that rudder
*  and your rudder has to be pointed in the right direction.
*  So along those lines, you meet Bridget.
*  Yeah.
*  And was it instantaneous?
*  No, we kind of had a friendship first.
*  I felt like at least we've discussed this.
*  I mean, I instantaneously enjoyed her company.
*  So I met Bridget in February of sophomore year.
*  I was on the campus of Naval Academy is called the yard.
*  I was on the yard all winter because the wrestling season
*  isn't the shittiest time ever, right?
*  It crosses over the holidays.
*  You have to make way during Thanksgiving.
*  You have to make way during Christmas.
*  We were on campus on the yard and it was easily
*  waist deep snow and we were doing two a day practices.
*  Everybody else is home on vacation.
*  That winter, I considered leaving and thank goodness
*  for no cell phones and stuff because I didn't know
*  how to leave.
*  It was like.
*  You considered leaving like leaving the Navy.
*  But it didn't have anything to do with the Naval Academy.
*  Really?
*  It had everything to do with that moment.
*  I was miserable.
*  Like I was making, I wrestled 190 my freshman year
*  and Doug graduated.
*  He was the 177 pounder.
*  So sophomore year I dropped into his spot.
*  I went down to 177.
*  Fighting weight for me is like 193.
*  But back then Andrew, I'm lifting a lot.
*  I was 210 to 215 in the off season and I cut to 177
*  sophomore year and I was just generally miserable.
*  If it was easy to leave, I probably would have.
*  And then I met Bridget in February and I was like,
*  fuck it, I'll stay.
*  She's better than this place anyway.
*  Having followed my high school girlfriend off to college
*  and not gone to college when I got there,
*  I just lived in the parking lot outside her dorm room.
*  I can relate.
*  I probably wouldn't be sitting here today
*  were it not for Eleni.
*  So I'd like to take a quick break
*  and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Plunge.
*  Plunge makes what I believe is the best
*  self-cooling cold water plunge.
*  Over the last decade and especially in the last five years,
*  there's been an increasing amount of excitement
*  about cold water plunging for sake of mental health,
*  physical health and performance.
*  And that's in large part because one of the most robust
*  effects of cold water exposure are big increases
*  in adrenaline, also called epinephrine and dopamine.
*  So while some people do cold water plunging
*  in pursuit of increasing metabolism
*  or reducing inflammation, it's really those big increases
*  in adrenaline and dopamine that lead to those
*  long lasting increases in alertness
*  and feelings of wellbeing, not just in the seconds
*  or minutes after the cold plunge,
*  but indeed for several hours afterwards.
*  I've been using a plunge for several years now,
*  typically first thing in the morning
*  or after cardiovascular training.
*  I do agree that doing cold water plunging
*  after a workout designed to generate hypertrophy
*  or strength gains is not a good idea,
*  but doing cold plunging at the other times of day
*  can be tremendously beneficial.
*  I use the version of plunge called the all in ice bath
*  and plunge now also makes saunas
*  that get up to 230 degrees Fahrenheit.
*  I love how the plunge ice bath and sauna
*  can both be controlled from an app on my phone
*  so that if I'm headed home, I can turn on the sauna
*  and it'll be hot when I arrive.
*  So if you would like to try a plunge ice bath or sauna,
*  you can go to plunge.com slash Huberman
*  to get $150 off either product.
*  Again, that's plunge.com slash Huberman.
*  So at what point did you decide
*  you wanted to aim for the SEAL teams?
*  It's a great question.
*  I mean, things, you know, as compared to
*  at a gunnery sergeant in the Marine Corps at prep school,
*  who I thought, these are back to the first people
*  you meet in this environment, Gunny Flynn.
*  And he was great.
*  Like he was super hard on us,
*  but I obviously kind of love that.
*  And I thought I was gonna go into the Marine Corps
*  and Doug wanted to go into the Marine Corps.
*  I'm a freshman at the Naval Academy.
*  He's my wrestling partner.
*  Doug could literally tell me to jump off of a building.
*  As long as he came with me, I'd do it, no problem,
*  and enjoy it all the way down.
*  Doug was going into the Marine Corps.
*  I thought I was gonna go into the Marine Corps.
*  And I did a summer training in Quantico
*  between freshman and sophomore year.
*  And it was okay.
*  It was good, but I didn't love it.
*  And I met a couple other guys
*  who were gonna compete for spots in the SEAL teams
*  who were years ahead of me.
*  But to answer your question, junior year,
*  you can sign up and say,
*  I wanna start competing for a billet.
*  We had 16 spots in my class.
*  I think there's 32 spots these days.
*  You know, the force has grown since 9-11, obviously.
*  And I wanna say maybe 150 or so people,
*  they put you through this weekend, overnight,
*  two-day, hell two-day things at Navy.
*  Some people quit.
*  I don't know how many go to what we used to call mini-BUDs
*  in the summer between junior and senior year.
*  You go out to Coronado and BUDs instructors,
*  they still have it, it's called something different.
*  You spend two weeks at the BUDs compound
*  and they run you through a mini program.
*  And so-
*  It's called BUDs for the, some folks listening to this
*  won't know the acronym.
*  The acronym is Basic Underwater Demolition SEAL, school.
*  That's our school in Coronado.
*  It's a screening process for who gets in, who doesn't.
*  Yeah, and when you're at the Naval Academy,
*  it's obviously different than guys coming
*  into the enlisted ranks.
*  You have this pool of people,
*  150-ish guys say they wanna go.
*  Sometime junior year, they run you through this weekend,
*  pretty hard, at Navy.
*  Cause we have SEALs stationed at the Naval Academy.
*  And then I'm just gonna guess that goes from 150 to 80.
*  Maybe 80 guys go to the summer program in Coronado
*  when you're still, you know,
*  a midshipman at the Naval Academy.
*  I've never, maybe people have quit mini-BUDs, I don't know.
*  But I don't know if I really saw anybody quit
*  the two weeks we're out in Coronado.
*  And then you get, you know,
*  graded on your performance and stuff.
*  And then you come back for senior year
*  and you go through a series of interviews
*  with a bunch of SEALs who come out and do interviews
*  and you don't really know what you're doing.
*  And then they select down, I don't wanna again, overdo it,
*  but it's probably seven, I don't know,
*  maybe 50 or 60 qualified guys.
*  They select you down to 16.
*  And so to answer your question about when I got interested
*  was when I knew I didn't wanna go in the Marine Corps,
*  I never ever had the top gun fever thing.
*  I wasn't interested in flying.
*  I just wasn't interested in anything else,
*  but something super physical.
*  And that seemed like the next best thing.
*  And because I grew up in New Orleans
*  and spent a lot of time in the water,
*  that wasn't intimidating.
*  That screens a lot of people out, obviously.
*  Yeah, and got selected in the group of 16
*  and was at Bud's after graduation,
*  a couple of months after graduation.
*  There's been a lot put out into the world around Bud's.
*  People have seen the log carrying and the boat carrying
*  and the screaming of the instructors and the running
*  and the clasped arms in the water and hell week,
*  sleep and on and on.
*  It's obviously tough.
*  It calls 85% of the people that go out there
*  thinking that they are the absolute last person
*  who would ever quit, ring the bell so to speak.
*  You obviously got through.
*  A while back, you mentioned to me three things
*  that you think predict whether or not somebody's
*  gonna get through Bud's.
*  And before you tell us what these are,
*  I will just tell people that yes, of course,
*  you made it through Bud's successfully
*  and went into the teams.
*  You had a very successful career in the teams.
*  But you've also been a Bud's instructor.
*  So you've been on the other side of the equation too.
*  What are those three things?
*  Yeah, this was, as you know, this was very anecdotal
*  but it lined up.
*  When I was back there in 05 as an instructor, Andrew,
*  I feel like we're not scientists, right?
*  But I feel like we tried every correlating data poll
*  that we could pull from pull-ups to runtimes
*  to you name it, to regions of the country
*  that people grow up near water.
*  At least back then, nothing correlated.
*  And so I was a first phase OIC, officer in charge.
*  And so our team in first phase,
*  we can talk about what that is in detail if you want to,
*  but first phase is in charge of Hell Week.
*  Hell Week's in the first two months of training.
*  And a couple of the guys said, all this bullshit about
*  this can get you through, that can get you through,
*  I bet that every single person we talk to out here
*  on the grinder has one of these three things.
*  They were a varsity athlete in high school or college,
*  their parents are divorced,
*  or they got suspended from school.
*  I guarantee it.
*  And we would walk around the grinder and ask.
*  And I mean, you know, this isn't gonna pass
*  an independent review board,
*  but it's gotta be 90 to 95%.
*  So that's incredible because, you know,
*  so much has been made of Buds and Hell Week.
*  And just to fill in a few of the blanks for those
*  that aren't familiar, Hell Week is what?
*  It's five nights, no sleep,
*  you get an hour or a couple minutes on one day.
*  But you're basically in constant movement for about a week.
*  You are.
*  And that's when most people voluntarily ring the bell.
*  And most of them do it before Wednesday.
*  Okay.
*  And I know it's got chaotic components, guns going off,
*  blasts, it's got hard work, boring components,
*  people that, people trying to make it through
*  have no sense of how long a run is gonna last
*  or what's gonna happen.
*  And you hear all this stuff like, okay,
*  you just don't quit or you just go meal to meal.
*  But what you just described is really interesting.
*  Let's break those three things down
*  because playing a varsity sport has certain elements.
*  Having divorced parents has certain elements.
*  And getting suspended in school has certain elements.
*  Let's start with divorced parents first.
*  As varsity sport, I think we can probably just quickly say,
*  okay, there's structure, you have to listen to somebody,
*  you have to be able to push yourself,
*  you have to have some level of physical competence.
*  Coachable.
*  Coachable, mental competence, work with others.
*  So there's something there, right?
*  And you presumably have to go through junior varsity
*  to get there, so there's some oomph and required
*  in any event.
*  But the divorced parents piece is what's surprising to me,
*  still is.
*  What, you have divorced parents, so do I.
*  Divorces occur for any number of different reasons.
*  What in the world do you think is the consequence
*  of a divorced household that would predict so well,
*  at least in this back of the envelope measurement
*  that you made, but as an instructor,
*  that people would get through this excruciatingly
*  difficult period of time?
*  For me, it was one thing specifically.
*  I felt like I was alone if I didn't have the team.
*  So I don't know what it would be for other people,
*  but I was like, if I don't have this team,
*  then what team do I have?
*  So I'm not leaving.
*  You could crank up the cold and misery
*  as high as you fucking want, but I'm not leaving.
*  Yeah, that hits deep.
*  I didn't do buds, I didn't even know
*  what the SEAL teams were, but I certainly know
*  the feeling of looking outside of the household
*  for a sense of family and belonging,
*  and the feeling that I'd much rather,
*  almost from a place of joy, I'd much rather die
*  for these people, hopefully not with these people,
*  but much rather die trying to save others
*  and to do well in that than to quit.
*  That's a powerful thing that you just shine light on.
*  I don't think of the hundreds of interviews
*  with team guys, ex-team guys, buds instructors,
*  et cetera, that are out there,
*  I don't think anyone's ever highlighted that.
*  I don't think I was aware of it then, Andrew,
*  but again, it's in retrospect.
*  Well, the retrospect is in large part what we're here for.
*  To go a little deeper on that,
*  I think that a lot of people have challenging homes,
*  the parents aren't necessarily divorced,
*  and we're talking, of course, about trying to understand
*  the human spirit, certainly not accomplishments per se,
*  but the human spirit, so I think that a lot of people,
*  especially nowadays, they look to their home life,
*  and if, God willing, they had a great home life,
*  that is the base, it's like the touchstone for them
*  that they can return to.
*  But for a lot of people, even people who go home
*  for the holidays or who touch in with their parents,
*  whether or not they're divorced or not,
*  they don't feel like that family unit
*  is really a solid thing.
*  Maybe they're in a place, I see this a lot,
*  where they're the parent, they had to grow up
*  taking care of the parents, I see that a lot,
*  on both the male side and the female side, I see that.
*  So you're saying that one strong predictor
*  of getting through is a feeling of people want,
*  essentially making it their, almost like,
*  biological identity to get through.
*  It was certainly the case for me.
*  I mean, when I got, again, I don't really like
*  to overdo these things because it tends to feed
*  the mythos a little.
*  But when I got to Buds, Andrew,
*  when I got to the Naval Academy,
*  I had a very strong sense of this is my chance.
*  And you develop over the years,
*  and you spend time thinking about this and having mentors.
*  When I got there, that was very much my first time of,
*  you better bring the nastiest shit on the planet
*  because I'm not leaving here.
*  Like, it's just not, I'm just not going.
*  And there's a Navy bit to it too.
*  Like, I didn't want to do anything else in the Navy.
*  So back to fear, I was afraid I would get stuck
*  doing a job I didn't like.
*  But there's some, people are not wrong about Buds.
*  There's some very difficult days where you do start
*  to wonder, like, is this really worth it?
*  I never once thought about quitting.
*  It never crossed my mind because I just had these other things
*  that I really had to do for myself and my life,
*  or else I felt like I was going to have nothing.
*  And so again, I don't think operating out of fear
*  is particularly adaptive, but sometimes it,
*  the bit in your teeth is useful.
*  Yeah, certainly in my own life, I could say,
*  getting real scared about being 19 and essentially realizing
*  I'm not good at anything.
*  I'm not good at anything.
*  And I was terrible at a lot of things.
*  And some of those things were taking me down a dangerous path.
*  That was the fear.
*  I'm grateful for the fear piece.
*  It scruffed me.
*  And let's talk about the suspended in school.
*  Yep.
*  First of all, that implies getting caught.
*  Yes.
*  Not just misbehaving, but getting caught.
*  Yeah, what do you think that's about?
*  So we're really talking about a sense of rebellion
*  against authority or the system that one finds themselves in.
*  Which is super important for our line of work.
*  Like for me, again, I can only speak for myself.
*  For me, it was the wild fuck you factor.
*  There's just a nasty reality of the work we had to do.
*  I was in from 98 until 2011.
*  In the SEAL teams.
*  In the SEAL teams from 98 until 2011.
*  Everybody knows what was happening between 9-11 and then.
*  It's not that it didn't stop happening.
*  I know from my own experience,
*  from 03 through 2010 was extremely intense.
*  Obviously the military has rules and we need rules.
*  And you follow the laws of armed conflict
*  and you follow the rules of engagement.
*  There's no question about that ever.
*  But the shit that happens to you out in the field for real
*  does not follow any pattern.
*  And so if you are a complete, you know,
*  non suspended from school rule follower,
*  I'm not saying you won't be successful.
*  I'm sure plenty of people are.
*  But in our line of work, if you ask people,
*  most of them had a weird streak as they were coming up.
*  Like they have a little bit of a side eye
*  when somebody tells them this is how stuff is.
*  Like, maybe it's like that.
*  But you don't know that.
*  And where it really became clear for me, Andrew,
*  was look at every stage in your development,
*  you're still looking for what right looks like.
*  And when I was, I'm now a Naval Academy graduate,
*  not that that means anything special,
*  but I'm smart enough.
*  I'm now in my 20s, I'm at Buds,
*  and I have this recollection later,
*  like people are always telling stories about the teams.
*  And when you're a new student at Buds,
*  you kind of believe everything the instructors tell you
*  because it's pretty impressive shit.
*  And then you find out later when you,
*  when I checked into SEAL Team 3,
*  you actually start to understand the arc of the job.
*  It's like all these guys were telling training stories.
*  Those weren't real combat stories.
*  Those, they never said that that was a story from training.
*  And so my point is like,
*  what you'd hope guys are getting it now,
*  but what we didn't get a lot of was the real story
*  in a sense, meaning I will say definitively,
*  my first combat deployment was 03 when we invaded Iraq.
*  I was a platoon commander, we invaded Iraq.
*  And I remember within a week of being in that situation,
*  thinking not one single instructor had the experience
*  to mentor and coach me on this, not one.
*  And so you have to go back to that wild,
*  suspended fuck you factor mindset,
*  like all your silly rules about how the military works,
*  none of that shit's happening out here.
*  All this other stuff is happening
*  that doesn't have anything to do with your training manuals,
*  except for the things you don't violate,
*  which is to your best of your ability, stuff happens,
*  but the rules of engagement and the laws of armed conflict,
*  everything else is a toss up.
*  The tactics aren't, that's not a toss up,
*  but you know what I mean,
*  like the environment is completely chaotic.
*  It's a new sport.
*  It's a brand new sport that no one coached you on.
*  And it's high risk, high consequence
*  for you and your teammates, but also for the other side.
*  I mean, every 15 seconds is a new consequential decision.
*  Yeah, because you obviously don't wanna kill civilians
*  on the other side either.
*  Of course not, yeah.
*  So you obviously get through buds.
*  You probably weren't surprised, given your mindset.
*  Probably weren't surprised.
*  No, no, I wasn't surprised.
*  At this point, I'm maybe building a little self-confidence
*  and they'll just operate out of fear.
*  But happy, presumably.
*  Oh yeah, yep.
*  And I feel obligated to ask,
*  well, I'm just curious to ask that,
*  you've been in a system of military for a long time.
*  Is there a bigger pole of patriotism there,
*  or it's there, but I mean, are you thinking about country,
*  or are you thinking about team?
*  You think about the day.
*  Yeah, I mean, at this point,
*  I'm fully indoctrinated in a sense.
*  The Naval Academy really does give you a sense of,
*  again, bigness and you meet people
*  from World War II in Vietnam.
*  An amazing guy, which we can cover later.
*  I wasn't around when he was coming up,
*  but Colonel John Ripley is a guy
*  who won the Navy Cross in Vietnam.
*  The book, The Bridge at Dong Ha is about him.
*  He knew my, this is back to my Uncle Jim who introduced,
*  he and my Uncle Jim were buddies.
*  I met him, he's since passed away.
*  I met Colonel Ripley when I was a pliebe
*  at the Naval Academy.
*  I work with one of his sons now, friend, teammate, mentor.
*  He's a great guy.
*  Colonel Ripley, he's a legend.
*  This guy's a Navy Cross winner,
*  should have won the Congressional Medal of Honor
*  by all accounts.
*  If you read the book, The Bridge at Dong Ha,
*  you are gonna have no ability to understand
*  why he's not dead.
*  And these are the kind of people you meet.
*  So back to the patriotism thing.
*  By the time I was in the teams,
*  I knew where I was sort of in this ecosystem.
*  Admittedly though, what I didn't really have, Andrew,
*  because I mean, I love the country of course,
*  but it wasn't, again, I didn't grow up with a dad
*  who was like, this was always in our house
*  or it just wasn't that big of a thing.
*  This came for me after 9-11, obviously.
*  But yes, the patriotism and the importance of the jobs there,
*  but when I remember checking in SEAL Team 3,
*  what emerged very quickly for me,
*  because we had Vietnam vets in the training cell
*  at SEAL Team 3 and just some amazing people,
*  what I realized right away was,
*  okay, play time is completely over.
*  And that was very useful, like early lesson.
*  Not that anyone was fucking around in buds,
*  like you know it's serious,
*  but you meet a guy like Master Chief Martin,
*  who's got 100 combat missions from Vietnam,
*  he's about to retire.
*  He was like the third person I met
*  when I checked into the team.
*  And you suddenly are like a kid again,
*  where there's just no fucking around.
*  So you're in the teams, presumably liking the work.
*  Loved it.
*  Loving the team component.
*  It's hard, it's unpredictable.
*  And that's part of the fun.
*  It's amazing, yeah.
*  The job's amazing.
*  You do a number of different deployments.
*  And at some point, you get called to try out
*  for the tier one division within the SEAL teams.
*  Maybe just explain a little bit of what tier one means.
*  And we don't wanna speak in code here,
*  but we just gotta inform people
*  that there are levels within the teams.
*  And then, yeah, tell us what tier one is.
*  Yeah, well, I'll just refer to it,
*  special mission unit, it's probably the easiest.
*  We have a bunch of teams on the East and West Coast,
*  as a lot of people know nowadays,
*  this shit was not public knowledge years ago.
*  Yeah, so you've got these different units
*  within the SEAL teams.
*  Yeah, so you have to raise your hand.
*  I was 10 years in, Andrew, I had been platoon commander
*  during the invasion of Iraq.
*  We came to Monterey, I went to school,
*  I went back to be a budge instructor.
*  It was 10 years, I felt like it was time to take my shot.
*  It's a little risky because it's hard to make it through,
*  green team and stuff at the special mission unit.
*  It's a nine month advanced training program.
*  You're 10 years into your career, you're not 22 anymore.
*  And not everyone gets called to green team.
*  Not everyone can go.
*  You can't say, I wanna go, I wanna try out.
*  You can say you wanna try out and you do a pre-screener.
*  So the command training staff,
*  I'll call it the command for purposes of this conversation
*  because I'm familiar with that term for us.
*  The command training staff comes out,
*  they put you through all this stuff.
*  Some of it's psychological, some of it's physiological.
*  I don't think we did a blood test, but they checked.
*  The trainers checked everything on me.
*  Which I thought, this is actually a description
*  of why the unit's tier one.
*  I was, even in the pre-screening,
*  it was the first time, the way I joke about it
*  is like I really felt like I was doing
*  what was in the brochure.
*  Like it was real varsity stuff.
*  You know.
*  I'm presaging a later conversation that we'll get to,
*  but at this point, have you ever sat down
*  with a psychologist and done a therapy session?
*  That was no therapy, but I sat down with a psychologist
*  because they put us through the battery,
*  the neopir, the raven, stuff like that.
*  They're asking you, how do you sleep at night?
*  How do you feel? All night, yeah.
*  What do you dream about?
*  How much do you drink and you say two beers a week and.
*  And you're lying. Everyone's lying.
*  Yeah, but now it might be two beers a week.
*  Now it's zero. Zero, right.
*  But yeah, so it was a good screening process.
*  I was like, oh shit, these guys are not messing around.
*  This is exactly what I wanted to do.
*  And the physical tests ramp up
*  and coincidentally, I worked for him later,
*  still friends with him now.
*  On my interview board was Britt Slabinski,
*  who won the Congressional Medal of Honor.
*  Britt was on my interview board and he's a great guy.
*  And so yeah, then you just wait.
*  And if you get picked up, you go out to the East Coast
*  and you're really rolling the dice
*  because I was on the West Coast.
*  You move your whole family, sell your house.
*  You may not have to sell your house, but we did.
*  And you move and you're gonna do
*  a nine month advanced training program at the command
*  just to get into a tactical unit,
*  which we call squadrons.
*  And the best way tactically for me
*  to describe the difference.
*  And look, my time at Team 3 was amazing.
*  I'm not diminishing it, but let me just use free fall,
*  military free fall for anybody who's
*  even done civilian free fall.
*  It's jumping airplanes.
*  Jumping.
*  So if we go to the drop zone and we go jumping, right?
*  FAA regulations have you jump at 12,999 feet
*  because as soon as you go above 13,000,
*  you have to use supplemental oxygen,
*  which is not a huge deal,
*  but it's a pain in the ass for the airplane to have it.
*  And so 99% of all your jumps,
*  well, at any standard drop zone,
*  your civilian jumps are gonna be below 13 grand.
*  For all of our jumping at SEAL Team 3 is below 13 grand.
*  It just makes the training more efficient.
*  And you'll jump during the daytime,
*  maybe a little night jumping.
*  You'll probably have some lights for safety.
*  And if you look out of the airplane,
*  you would be able to see the orange T on the drop zone.
*  That's your standard jump profile.
*  Maybe you'll jump with some weight.
*  You'll certainly jump with your weapon,
*  probably your helmet, but not all your jumps
*  because you're bringing guys from zero
*  to be able to do tactical military free fall as a group.
*  When you go to the command,
*  your jumps are from 25,000 feet.
*  You do 30 minutes of pre-breathing on oxygen,
*  helmet, night vision, zero lights,
*  an attack board that has your navigation system on it,
*  100 pounds of gear, your weapon, your oxygen, all your shit,
*  and 45 dudes piled up in a C-17.
*  And you drop miles away from the drop zone
*  because your over ground speed at 25,000 feet
*  is hauling ass because of the wind.
*  And if you take your hands out of your gloves
*  at 25,000 feet, it's curtains.
*  You're not gonna be able to use your fingers
*  because it's so cold.
*  And you jump from way away, obviously,
*  and all your jump is completely blacked out.
*  Everybody turns IR lights on,
*  their helmets and their infrared lights
*  so you can see through night vision.
*  And you gotta fly that canopy multiple, multiple miles
*  and land everybody on a drop zone.
*  If you take every tactical thing we do
*  and expand the same way you would expand free fall,
*  that's the difference at the command.
*  Which is, look, I wanna own this.
*  When I was at Team Three, because you think about this,
*  I had many, many moments where I was thinking,
*  ah, fuck it, man, those guys aren't that much different.
*  Like, we're super high end, right?
*  And we are.
*  And then when I got there, I was like,
*  this is another level.
*  What percentage of people that go to green team
*  get through and get sort of...
*  I think I had 65 in my class.
*  You don't drop that many.
*  Maybe 10 guys didn't make it or something.
*  Maybe 15-ish.
*  So then you were, why do they call it tier one?
*  No idea.
*  It must have some official reason.
*  Because if you go into real documentation, Andrew,
*  there's echelons in...
*  This command is echelon this,
*  this command is echelon this.
*  And the military, Congress sets end strength numbers.
*  It says, the Navy, you get, at the one time,
*  because it took some class,
*  the Navy had like 355,000 people,
*  and that's the Navy's end strength.
*  And they have to distribute those numbers
*  across everybody in the Navy.
*  So I don't know why it's called tier one,
*  but I think it has a reason.
*  So you got through, you were accepted,
*  and then you're doing very different sorts of things
*  than you were doing previously.
*  Very.
*  So my understanding is this is largely counter-terrorist work.
*  So all the work in the military and SEAL teams
*  is high risk, high consequence,
*  but now it's special operations, as the name implies,
*  where things have to be worked out.
*  On a case-by-case basis, it's highly unusual.
*  It was unusual before,
*  but now it's highly unusual circumstances.
*  What was it like to be there?
*  Did you like that family?
*  I loved it.
*  It was the best place to work.
*  And this is 2000?
*  This is 06 through 2011 for me.
*  Okay, so it's post 9-11 through 2011.
*  Yep. Okay.
*  So I'm sure a lot happened,
*  and most of which we can't and won't discuss,
*  and that's not what's important here.
*  But clearly you met and worked
*  with some amazing individuals.
*  I happen to know because we've spoken before
*  and we have some common friends in that arena,
*  that you had both the privilege of doing this work
*  in this really important war time,
*  but also the unfortunate experience of being close to
*  and working with quite a lot of people that were killed.
*  Yep.
*  How many?
*  So, I mean, I don't know why I did this
*  or why anyone does it.
*  It's way over 40, but I try not to over-affiliate myself
*  with a larger group than I actually knew.
*  But the people that I personally knew, Andrew,
*  it's exactly 40.
*  And we could spend probably weeks detailing
*  how impressive each and every one of those people was
*  in their individual cases.
*  This is perhaps an opportunity to put a call out.
*  There's a wonderful book, I think an important book,
*  that isn't so well known in the array
*  of quote unquote military and seal books,
*  which is the book about Adam Brown,
*  the fearless book.
*  I heard they're gonna make it into a movie,
*  but what I like about the book is,
*  actually has very little to do with the SEAL teams.
*  Totally, that's the best thing.
*  Is that Adam had a serious, serious problem with addiction
*  that he masked at times and it came back to pull him under
*  various times while he was in the teams.
*  And I know you worked with Adam and you're close.
*  He was in my green team, yeah.
*  Yeah, so that's a great book for anyone that wants it,
*  a different sort of book.
*  It's really about addiction and family
*  and his discovery of the path out of all that.
*  His tenacity is incredible.
*  Awesome, awesome book, Human,
*  about an awesome, awesome human.
*  So you do those years.
*  And then, what happens when 40 people close to you die?
*  40 people close to you die,
*  I have to imagine involves that you get pretty good,
*  unfortunately, at taking what each
*  and every one of those is a tragedy and just continuing.
*  So let's just talk about that for a bit, if you're willing.
*  So guys are getting shot and blown up
*  and you're close with them to say the least.
*  And what was your role in the aftermath?
*  What do you do?
*  You go to a funeral, you toast a few beers
*  and then you go back to work?
*  That's kind of, in the most simplistic terms,
*  that is exactly what happens.
*  There's obviously a lot more that goes on,
*  but if you script the diary, so to speak,
*  it wasn't a funeral every three months,
*  but on average, if I average it out,
*  because I've done this in excavating the last few years,
*  we were at a funeral or memorial effectively every 90 days
*  and in that time period.
*  But it wasn't obviously that simple.
*  Like for me and our family,
*  Doug was my first super close teammate killed
*  and it wasn't in the team, right?
*  I'm now at the command.
*  I was back from Afghanistan, from Kandahar.
*  This is way before the Marines built up
*  100 kilometers west of Kandahar.
*  We were operating six of us with like 180 Afghans,
*  kind of the Wild West back then.
*  And Doug was killed that summer of 07
*  and I got a phone call from a friend.
*  I was standing in my kitchen at Virginia Beach
*  and it was like,
*  like the whole scaffolding of the world was just gone.
*  Because at that age, and here I am, like I'm some kid,
*  I was in my 30s, but I'm thinking,
*  you know, things get more and more serious as you go,
*  like at that time.
*  But when Doug was killed and I was a pallbearer
*  in his funeral and you know, we came up to Annapolis.
*  He was living in Annapolis because he was working,
*  it's now been publicly released, which is nice for Pam
*  because she can talk about it more.
*  He was working at the agency.
*  And when after his funeral and just the days around that
*  and then I go back to work
*  and what I mentioned earlier about Doug
*  and what I knew about him just as an operator,
*  he had been a company commander in Fallujah.
*  He was on the front page of the LA Times.
*  Like Tony Perry is a reporter in San Diego.
*  He was in Fallujah following Doug.
*  The guy was, and Doug is not like a public people.
*  People just attracted to him to tell his story.
*  I have so many stories that I heard later from his bosses,
*  his regimental commander, you know,
*  told stories about his unit in Fallujah,
*  his Sergeant Major and his amazing guy.
*  I've talked to him about like what went on in Fallujah.
*  Doug is just a fucking legend.
*  I mean, he was awesome.
*  And the dominant thought after his funeral was
*  if things, it's not that you don't think they're serious.
*  And I mean just about life, Andrew.
*  It wasn't just about combat action and hard deployments.
*  It was about if Doug can be killed, all fucking bets are off.
*  They're all off.
*  Like if I didn't respect the rules before
*  and didn't think society was particularly ordered
*  in a way that I respected, you know,
*  shit that I think is made up,
*  I knew when Doug was killed that it's all fucking made up.
*  Like he was supposed to be the immortal one.
*  And if he's not, none of us are.
*  Like everything has to be reevaluated.
*  You know, how old was I? I was 32.
*  And you've got kids at this point.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  Yeah, Ollie wasn't born yet, my youngest.
*  Because you now have three boys.
*  Yeah, three boys, 21, 18, and 14.
*  And the older two were born.
*  My middle son was two at the time.
*  Did it occur to you at the point when Doug was killed
*  or maybe some other point that, you know, at some point you could die?
*  Oh, I mean, that's what I mean, Andrew.
*  Like I, you know, personal work and therapy afterwards,
*  it was then that I started looking over my shoulder,
*  just in general, like everything was suddenly.
*  Like has to be watched with a vigilant eye.
*  Something that close friends, close male friends of mine have told me,
*  these are friends that are married with kids.
*  And I've heard this from people that were in the military and
*  as well as those that weren't, was that it was very important to them
*  to. Marry somebody who were they to die,
*  they knew their kids would be well taken care of.
*  Oh, that one's not even there's no question about that.
*  Yeah. So that that was like a primary criteria.
*  And I think in your line of work, I mean, that that must be especially important
*  because the probability of dying is, well, let's face it, is as much higher
*  as my sister, who doesn't like sharks, once told me, she said,
*  you know, the best way not getting my sharks never go in the ocean.
*  You know, there is a way to limiting probabilities.
*  She'll swim in the ocean a little bit.
*  But but the point being that when you're in the military and you're
*  you're shoot, move and communicate is a big part of the job description.
*  And the the enemy is also taught to shoot, move and communicate that
*  there's there's a decent probability that you could die.
*  So did you ever think, OK, well, if I die,
*  my kids are OK because Bridget solid.
*  Or were you still just operating on this 24 hour schedule
*  that you had adopted way back in the seventh grade?
*  No, I think. Well, maybe I'd have to ask her that question.
*  I think I was backed away from the 24 hour ledge a little bit.
*  I I knew that the boys obviously would be
*  taken care of with my wife, like that was never
*  I never crossed my mind probably until you just asked the question.
*  That was almost just like table stakes.
*  Back to this adaptive but maladaptive behavior.
*  When Doug was killed, I just realized I had to work even harder.
*  To try to stay alive.
*  Because if you met the guy, there is I'm going to say it
*  probably multiple there is not a fucking human on the planet
*  that was as tough and as focused and as.
*  Hyper dialed in to how to do the job.
*  100% effectively.
*  As he was, and.
*  It happened to him, you know, and I just never
*  it's almost embarrassing, Andrew, to say I never thought about it
*  like that until Doug was killed.
*  And yet, and I'm not challenging that at all, of course, I mean,
*  life circumstances, the other team gets a vote to totally right.
*  I mean, I mean, somebody can be seemingly indestructible,
*  oh, so capable and talented and get T-boned in an intersection.
*  And right like like that.
*  Yeah, we've known people like that.
*  All of us that, you know, you hear these things.
*  That's why they're called tragedies.
*  Yeah, we just we just like to put it in context.
*  We have to remember is part of the beauty.
*  Of taking a young person and taking all the ingredients
*  that a person comes into special operations, pick your service.
*  I'm not I'm agnostic. I mean.
*  Some of my best buddies are on the Marine Corps, like I'm agnostic
*  to the service head is when you end up at a certain point,
*  like and you look back, you realize for 10 or 15 years,
*  I've been indoctrinated in a very adaptive way.
*  To believe that I'm immortal.
*  Because if you didn't.
*  You certainly wouldn't jump out of aircraft at 25000 feet with no lights
*  and you for hell for sure wouldn't go into some of these fucking towns
*  we go into and end up in these firefights like you have some weird.
*  I'll speak for myself.
*  I was entirely convinced that I couldn't be killed.
*  And I just because I was in some way,
*  Andrew convinced that our training was so good.
*  That that shit wouldn't happen to us.
*  Let's take a step back for a second and acknowledge the truth
*  all around that set of statements, which is that
*  I think most people can think of the government and the training programs as
*  honing the body, but
*  it's probably not lost on you at this point in your life that the you were
*  you're a weapon.
*  Your mind became a weapon, right?
*  Your your body became a weapon.
*  You were a weapon of the military from the inside out.
*  And in the statement you just made encapsulates that.
*  And that weapon honed itself for a long time.
*  But then that's what the military is.
*  It creates weapons and of humans.
*  And I'm not demonizing the military whatsoever.
*  I want to be very clear.
*  I realize that statement could be construed differently.
*  But but that mindset encapsulates that.
*  So so with the other guys, I want to make sure I finish your question.
*  So it started with Doug.
*  And then, you know, I don't know what direction you want to go here specifically.
*  But then it just kept going, Andrew, right?
*  Like at that time, Doug was oh seven.
*  And then we went to Iraq in the winter of oh seven oh eight, which was.
*  Complete mayhem.
*  And the troop was I mean, my my troop in the winter of oh seven oh eight.
*  We're like. Fucking superheroes.
*  And a guy named Tommy Valentine was the troop chief.
*  And we got home and he was killed in a parachute accident.
*  After all that shit we went through.
*  Badger, a guy named Mark Carter was killed in that deployment.
*  We got home and Tommy was killed in a parachute accident.
*  And me and a guy named Dutch, we went up to Minnesota
*  to notify Tommy's parents and his sister and his brother.
*  And we're not the Navy calls them Kaco's like casualty assistance officers.
*  These are jobs in the military where you're trained to do this stuff.
*  You know, one of the things that's amazing about us is if a guy gets killed,
*  we send a team guy there.
*  But think about the team guy.
*  Like it's great for the family that you send the team guy.
*  But we don't know shit about sitting with a family who's about to be notified
*  that their son, in this case of Tommy, was killed.
*  Britt went to Christina's house, slab, Britt Slabinski.
*  He went to Christina's house and me and Dutch went up to Minnesota.
*  And. I'm shaking right now, like I was shaking
*  the whole drive. We had to get to International Falls all way up north.
*  The Valentines are incredible people.
*  And I mean, notifying a family was just.
*  It was brutal. And so this is this is this is a weight.
*  And then it just keeps coming.
*  It's Nate and it's Mike and it's Lance and it's extortion in 2011.
*  And in the middle of that, Adam gets killed, right?
*  Like tons of people know about extortion because it was one helicopter, obviously.
*  Well, maybe we just just briefly want to mention that was August 2011, as I recall.
*  Yes. Yeah. August of 11. Yeah.
*  So but in 2010, Adam is killed.
*  And. I got a phone call
*  and I wasn't best friend.
*  I mean, Adam has some very close friends as the command that I don't want to make
*  some anybody give the impression that like me and Adam were boys, we were
*  we knew each other well, right?
*  We went through green team together.
*  He was in a different squadron, though, so you sort of get separated a little.
*  And I got a phone call in the middle of the night
*  from one of my buddies who's still in, who is another legend.
*  And. I answered the phone and it's midnight.
*  I knew something was wrong.
*  And we were kind of in this pattern then.
*  And you're like, actually, a few of the commands were like our partner command
*  and a bunch of other guys we work with and other units.
*  It was a hard time, like guys were fighting hard overseas.
*  And that just comes with the consequences we know, you know,
*  and I get the phone call in the middle of night.
*  I'm like. And so.
*  This guy tells me, you know, get your uniform, you need to come in.
*  Something happened.
*  I'm like, I fucking know what happened, like, tell me who it is.
*  And, you know, you didn't want to say it over the phone, which I get.
*  And I. I had like one of those moments where I told him, no,
*  I can't I can't do that again.
*  Like, you have to get somebody who knows what the fuck they're doing.
*  And he just didn't let me off the hook, you know.
*  Get your shit and come come into the command,
*  because you got to do all this prep stuff. And.
*  I walked into the conference room.
*  I mean, I remember it clears day and I walked into the conference room
*  and I could see it on everybody's face.
*  Again, this is 2010 now.
*  They were more terrified than I was.
*  And these are, you know, civilian guys, guys who retired who are now civilians.
*  They work at the command and amazing people.
*  And they looked like.
*  I don't know if you've seen Peter Jackson's remake.
*  They shall not grow old.
*  Oh, you have to watch it.
*  They shall not grow old is Peter Jackson took.
*  Real World War One. Oh, I did see that.
*  Yeah. Yes. Put the color in the lip reading and it.
*  And there's a scene.
*  I don't know if it's a battle of the bulger exactly.
*  There's a scene where.
*  This young unit army unit is about to go up over the top
*  and run across the open field and the camera pans over.
*  And there's a young kid with his rifle in front of him.
*  The bayonet affixed to it, his helmet on his lips are sort of flat and pursed.
*  And he everybody in that conference room looked like him.
*  When I saw that movie later, I'm like every single person looked like him.
*  And they told me it was Adam and we were going to go notify Kelly.
*  His wife.
*  And he had little ones at that point.
*  Savannah and Nathan, you know, they were small and.
*  We knocked on she had a sort of a stained glass
*  like window, and I could see her at the top of the.
*  The stairs.
*  Also, worst man.
*  It was the worst.
*  So we sat with Kelly and a bunch of other guys were there, of course,
*  it wasn't just me, and we did our best.
*  And I learned later and, you know,
*  reading Paul's work, Dr. Conti and other people and.
*  Like that was it, dude, I was like a I don't know if it's a locust or whatever
*  that sheds their skin.
*  I literally like left a shell of myself on Kelly's front porch
*  and walked out of my skin.
*  It was that was tough.
*  That was tough.
*  And so that was kind of.
*  The tempo to answer your question, like it wasn't exactly every 90 days.
*  But almost every 90 days from 06 to 2011 for me,
*  I got out in the fall of 2011, it was Memorial at the theater,
*  Memorial at the People's House.
*  You know, and our neighbor across the street in Virginia Beach,
*  she lost her husband in 07, so one house over.
*  So she was best friends with us, you know, and so you are trying to live two lives.
*  You have this.
*  You have this.
*  Military life with all these consequences where.
*  Every bone in your body is telling you to.
*  Go full Spartan, like, no, not that the Spartans didn't have families
*  because they did whatever did nothing else, like just cut off
*  every other thing in your life completely.
*  You have to go do this and you have to do it full on because clearly
*  all bets are off, like we're barely making it through.
*  We're losing our best guys.
*  And how the fuck do I survive if at this pace?
*  And so because we're all in the same community in Virginia Beach,
*  you're around it all the time when you're home, you know, and you should be
*  because you're supporting your teammates, families, and that's important.
*  But it was just it's almost like a dream.
*  You know, when I think about it now, how do how did we live like that?
*  How does anyone live like that?
*  And I know, you know, my experience as a military people go through,
*  you know, all sorts of tough situations in different walks of life.
*  But I have so much compassion for anybody who's trying to live
*  in an environment like that, where.
*  You know, you are going on the next deployment and, you know, I mean, look,
*  Andrew, we left Baku in in 08 before Tommy was killed
*  three fucking weeks later, guys are getting blown up in the same area.
*  Like, and they they got all the debris from us.
*  They knew exactly where to go.
*  But it was just such a kinetic environment.
*  We it was almost like you couldn't stop it, you know,
*  it was just like the balls rolling.
*  And when I think about people overseas and, you know, different situations
*  that countries find themselves in right now.
*  I can feel it for for them, you know, what they're what it takes.
*  It's a. It's an intense environment.
*  Certainly that comes through.
*  I think years ago, you said to me.
*  And this will be an important way of of setting aside
*  which side people are on, you know, whether or not you side with
*  one group in the Middle East or the other, you feel for everybody that
*  one of the things that you said that really rung in my ears for a long time is that
*  the warriors on both sides.
*  In their own minds, each and all of them
*  are just doing what they think is right for them and their families.
*  So you cannot erase that fact, like whether or not the government
*  of this country or the government of that country or group was correct
*  or incorrect, whether or not you're even talking about a terrorist cell
*  versus a military, a formal military group or special operations group
*  that in the minds of the warriors, they're doing what they truly believe
*  is right for them and their families.
*  And sometimes country as well.
*  And when I heard that, it was sort of a, you know, it's sort of an obvious
*  statement on the one hand, but it's a very important one, I think, to the
*  psychology that, you know, everyone's fighting tooth and nail
*  because they believe that they are right or they're just fighting tooth
*  and nail for whatever reason.
*  And that was an important thing for me to hear.
*  And I think about that a lot when I see any news stories about international
*  conflict or terrorist military conflict, terrorist civilians, stuff, even
*  people, there's something about the human brain.
*  People get this into their mind.
*  Like this is my job and they're doing it.
*  Doesn't justify it.
*  Right.
*  But going back to this thing of being a weapon, humans can be trained as
*  weapons and it's often not the weapons themselves that are making the
*  decisions about where to go and what to do.
*  Sometimes it is.
*  At this time, Coleman, what's going on with the three boys with Bridget?
*  I mean, your boys have turned out really well.
*  They're amazing.
*  And there's no coincidence there.
*  And obviously it was a team effort with you and Bridget, but there are a
*  lot of things about the way the scenario you're describing here that
*  speaks to like, how can a home function?
*  But obviously it functioned well and, you know, it's remarkable, but it's
*  So were you able to compartmentalize like the moment you hit your front door,
*  your dad at home, your husband, your, and was that a pause in the conversation
*  with yourself at the front door?
*  That's just something that becomes reflexive.
*  I mean, I think it was just reflexive.
*  It wasn't really a pause at the front door.
*  It was just a pause.
*  It was just a pause.
*  It was just a pause.
*  I think it was just reflexive.
*  It wasn't really a pause at the front door.
*  And admittedly, the story I would like to tell is that I was super Zen about it.
*  And I had this process and I would come home and I would take this off and put
*  on regular dad things.
*  And I think I was just by the same level of effort that we put into what we were
*  doing.
*  Bridget and every other wife, mom, at least the ones that I knew, they put that
*  level effort in as well.
*  It made our home life just very comfortable.
*  So it was easy.
*  Like I didn't have to go through some process, right?
*  It was this how I remember it.
*  It was easy for me.
*  I don't know if it was easy for Bridget.
*  She would have to answer that question.
*  It was easy for me.
*  And so I felt like for the most part, like I wasn't like Platoon Commander Dad, you
*  know, some movie, you know, the great Santini type dad.
*  You know, I think Pat Conroy wrote the great Santini.
*  His dad was crazy, apparently.
*  I would say that's what he writes about.
*  It wasn't like that.
*  It was more of this home is such a relief.
*  And Bridget is so dialed that I don't have to, unfortunately, hard for Bridget.
*  I don't have to do anything.
*  You know, the time that I'm here, I can be here and then, you know, go away again.
*  And so it's as we know, what trauma does to the mind.
*  Like there are many, many stretches of that time period that I just don't remember.
*  And what I do remember is mostly obviously the fun times, the front yard, the whatever,
*  playing with the boys, doing rough housing and going on vacation and stuff.
*  But when I was in the grind, when we were in the training cycle of our cycle or
*  deployment or whatever, I don't really remember sections of it.
*  So a lot, far too many, I guess even one would be far too many doorbells ringing
*  on doorbells. You decided to get out.
*  Mm hmm.
*  Was that a conscious decision based on time, conscious decision based on like, I
*  would like to have the rest of my life.
*  You're done.
*  I like to call it a regret, you know, but it's just kind of emblematic of where I was.
*  It was the right decision.
*  I do not regret getting out at the 13 year mark, not for a second.
*  It I needed it.
*  We needed it as a family.
*  It was a snap.
*  It was a snap decision.
*  It was like a, what do we say, 24 hour, just 24 hour horizon.
*  I was standing on the ledge of the 24 hour horizon.
*  And you said what year was that again?
*  That was the fall of 2011.
*  2011.
*  Yeah.
*  I guess that's about four or five years before you and I met.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  So extortion, we can just, we don't have to touch into it too deeply because people
*  can look it up, but this was a, a massive loss of special operations, including a
*  lot of seals.
*  Um, it was basically a helicopter shot out of the sky with a, uh, with a wrap,
*  but with a grenade, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  RPG RPG.
*  Um, people can look it up if they want to.
*  And, um, there's a lot of material out there about it.
*  Um, and it's just can only be described as a tragedy.
*  So, um, and I'm not trying to make light of it.
*  I just think, you know, that we could do, there's a lot to explore there for, in a
*  different discussion, um, in case you're out now, the probability that you're going
*  to die is much lower provided.
*  It's not my nervous system said.
*  Right.
*  But you're, you're out.
*  And what do you do?
*  Meaning what do you do with all that energy?
*  The energy of the way you've been operating up until now, these intense
*  battle rhythms, vampire schedules, as you call them, but also what do you do with
*  all the energy of what happened?
*  You know, I think this is where I think our conversation really hopefully has
*  been related to other people as we've been going, but that, you know, sometimes
*  I stop and I'm like, I know I'm supposed to process all this stuff, you know,
*  it that's happened, but it's like, what do you do when so much has happened?
*  Or when something's happened that you know, you have to move on from, you know,
*  you need to compartmentalize, but that lives in our nervous system.
*  So are you thinking about that?
*  No, you're Coleman Ruiz at that point.
*  You're just, you're just going forward.
*  It's just fucking crazy.
*  I mean, I just didn't know, you know, it's 2011.
*  It doesn't sound like that long ago, but still in 2011, this was not a
*  topic for conversation, you know?
*  And I took maybe one week to process out.
*  I turned in my gear.
*  I turned in my badge.
*  And my next visit to the command years later, I had to be escorted on by people
*  I worked with in the same fucking squadron.
*  Like, so within a matter of one week, I'm a stranger.
*  Like I can't get on the base.
*  There's reasons for that.
*  I get that, but I'm just using it as a, I mean, there was nothing dishonorable
*  about how you went.
*  It's just that there's security reasons.
*  Once you're out, like you can't just drive on the base anymore, you know?
*  And this is like emblematic of, of course I didn't talk to anybody about it.
*  Not even Bridget, but at the time in those first call it couple of years or
*  even couple of months, I don't know.
*  The question you just asked me is a question I was asked, like, what do I do?
*  Like not with work, like what do I do period with life?
*  Like, how do I manage my time?
*  And I'm not some bumbling idiot.
*  It's not like I was walking around the neighborhood, like trying to figure
*  out where my house was.
*  I, I had just been in that environment for so long to your point that, um, I
*  didn't know what to do.
*  I didn't know what to do with my thoughts, my feelings, my, you know, I
*  could go to the Buddhist five aggregates, my thoughts, feelings, perceptions,
*  physical form, and kind of like all these things I've learned about and thought
*  about later that have helped so much.
*  I didn't know what to do with any of it.
*  Like, I didn't know what to do with nights was I didn't know what to do with.
*  I thought the term PTSD was the, was the biggest fucking joke on the planet until
*  I read all the symptoms and I'm like, wait, wait a minute.
*  Um,
*  it sounds like it sounds familiar.
*  And so it's that Andrew was like, and so I remember like even the little things
*  that kind of make the point of the big things.
*  I didn't know how to get a dentist.
*  Like I could just go to the dentist in the military.
*  I, you know, I thought when I was walking around the food line that somebody was
*  going to call me and say, come back to the base because like the bubble went up,
*  you just, I had zero context and didn't have the Kurt or the, not even, not even
*  just the courage, but know who to ask.
*  Right.
*  It wasn't the mentoring.
*  One of the most important books in my life in the last 12 years has been Joseph
*  Campbell's, the hero with a thousand faces for the backend of the hero's journey.
*  And I haven't read it.
*  I know I should, I know I should actually listen to it.
*  I should listen to it.
*  It's better to, I've probably only listened to five audio books in my life.
*  I prefer to read in paper because I can take notes in the margin.
*  That book is better listened to.
*  Hero with a thousand faces.
*  The hero with a thousand faces.
*  Could you just highlight a couple of the things that you took from the backend of
*  that, that somehow shifted your mind toward like, like cued you.
*  I've been thinking Coleman Ruiz, uh, circa 2011 is like, like, what do I do now?
*  And then something cues you.
*  There's like a beacon someplace.
*  It's like, I always think of this like a texture of something and you're like,
*  Oh, I want to, you know, you want to feel it more to get a sense of what it is.
*  That is about right.
*  It wasn't that case for sure.
*  Um, so Joseph Campbell wrote that book in 1949 and the hero with a thousand faces
*  is effectively the 17 stage hero journey, which by the way, George Lucas says, and
*  has said many times publicly, he built the arc of store wars around the 17 stage
*  hero's journey.
*  He credits Joseph Campbell's book for helping him.
*  And if you ever read it or you go through the 17 stages or you see it or watch a
*  short video, anybody, you'll see how damn near everybody's life, which is why it's
*  called the monomyth.
*  He describes it as the monomyth or the cosmogonic cycle.
*  It's a little weirder term for it.
*  Um, but what he lays out in the book is, I don't know, maybe supposedly 2000 years
*  of culture across multiple cultures.
*  Book is incredibly complicated in that sense.
*  Andrew, when I, so I listened to it audio first and then went back to it and
*  listened to it in paper.
*  I could not believe how a human could put this narrative together, honestly.
*  And so, but the summary, I struggled with the first 10 stages a little bit, but it,
*  I'll try to come back to them.
*  If you, if you look at the image, when you lay out the 17 stages, the way it's in a
*  circle is the ordinary world and the extraordinary world is on the bottom of
*  the page.
*  I mean, there's a horizontal line.
*  The diameter of that circle goes horizontally across and the extraordinary
*  world is on the bottom.
*  The ordinary world is on the top.
*  Okay.
*  And so let me talk about the back end of the journey first, because what I was
*  mostly concerned about with when a friend pointed me to that book was my return to
*  the ordinary world.
*  And he told me, you Coleman, you got to read this book.
*  And so the back end of the hero's journey in the return section is three,
*  four, seven stages of the 17.
*  It's the ultimate boon, which is you learned something big in life.
*  It depended on everybody learns something where you sort of realize that
*  something big happened to me.
*  That's the ultimate boon.
*  And you had this incredible desire to do something with it.
*  It's either knowledge or it's experience or whatever.
*  And the ultimate boon you have and you feel like this life thing.
*  And then the next stage is typically a refusal of the return.
*  You really don't want to come back to the ordinary world because you feel that
*  there is some level of consequence that maybe you can't handle or somebody won't
*  understand, you know, or maybe it's too mundane.
*  You'll be, maybe you'll feel a drift.
*  Totally.
*  Yeah.
*  And this is in the description of the stages.
*  What you just described as part of that description, the next stage you're coming
*  up back into the ordinary world in this return is magic flight and the way it's
*  described in, you know, myths or in real life is you have to escape that
*  extraordinary world and take one more dangerous flight or, or sneak away or
*  something is catapulting you to take that ultimate boon and fight against that
*  refusal.
*  You're, you're taking magic flight.
*  Amazing.
*  And then there is, is it, it's, it's assistance.
*  I think it's like assistance from a, like a special power or something, which
*  could be your own or somebody else.
*  Right.
*  And then, and then suddenly you're into the last three, which is crossing the
*  crossing the return threshold into the ordinary world master of two worlds
*  where you finally realize through help and or process where you can hold these
*  two opposing life experiences in place.
*  And then the very last stage 17 is freedom to live.
*  And when you can, I'm going to give you my little pet theory in a second.
*  When you can work your way through those stages, you can have the freedom to
*  live.
*  What I realized potentially happened to me, just my internal feelings about, you
*  know, my coming in out of the military and back is if you skip or you don't
*  figure out how to deal with the refusal to return and, and you just pick, I'm
*  going to call it the next big thing.
*  You catapult yourself into a new cycle and you never finish.
*  And one of two things has happened.
*  You're either two people trapped in the ordinary world or you're one person
*  trapped in the, in two worlds.
*  I don't know which it is.
*  Like it's either two worlds in one person or it's two people trying to live in one
*  world, but shit gets crazy because you just haven't done the cycle.
*  And it sounds very misculin, but if you read it here with a thousand faces, you
*  like this journey is not new.
*  Like this is thousands of years of very typical human cycle.
*  Now, if we go back to the top of the circle, let me try to scream to the first
*  10, which will be very obvious for Star Wars fans.
*  Just think about what Luke does.
*  And I'm not like a super star Wars person.
*  I've seen the movies, but it's a call to adventure.
*  Most of us have a call to adventure of some sort in our life.
*  Refuse the call help from a mentor crossing the first threshold, the belly
*  of the whale, which is described as when you first truly separate, this was me
*  leaving for college when you first truly separate from the ordinary world road of
*  trials, meeting the goddess, temptations, atonement with the father, apostasis,
*  which is kind of like dying a death while you're still alive.
*  And then you're into those return stages.
*  And when I first read that book, Andrew, I was like, I'm trapped in the return.
*  I'm trapped somewhere in the return.
*  Just emotionally.
*  And one of the places that I was absolutely trapped in the return was I didn't have the
*  mentor to help me cross the threshold.
*  I knew I had to move on in my life.
*  I knew I had learned something extremely valuable.
*  I knew that there was a way through because people across thousands of years of humanity
*  have done it.
*  I don't think I'm special.
*  And I never had the mentor.
*  I got mentors later, you know, a couple of years out.
*  And it reminds me that in the so I got out in the fall of 2011 in the summer, one of
*  my very good friends who lives in Connecticut, he works in New York.
*  He brought me to a lunch at some fancy club in New York with a guy named Buddy Bukha,
*  Paul Buddy Bukha, who won the Congressional Medal of Honor.
*  He's a West Point grad.
*  He won the CMH in Vietnam.
*  I'd been around a lot of, you know, famous military people.
*  Lunch was very normal, but Buddy was amazing.
*  It was a normal lunch.
*  We didn't talk about much like impact.
*  We didn't talk about combat action or whatever.
*  There was a green velvet set of stairs.
*  We were leaving the club, the upstairs.
*  We were coming down the green set of stairs.
*  If I remember, Buddy's a little bit shorter than I am.
*  He reached out as I was on his left.
*  He reached out his left arm.
*  I was a stair, one stair below him.
*  He stopped me.
*  I turned to my right to look at him.
*  He looked at me.
*  He said, son, you have it.
*  You know that?
*  You have it.
*  PTS.
*  And you're going to have to deal with it.
*  And we left.
*  I got in a cab and I left.
*  And I remember thinking, you might have it, but I don't.
*  Because that's the old days.
*  Like we're, we were prepared for this shit.
*  I was still convinced that I'm good.
*  Like nothing happened to me.
*  Nothing in the military happened to me.
*  That's just normal stuff.
*  And all of our training, it's a story I told myself, all of our training prepared me for that.
*  Like this, the rest of my life is just going to, nothing bad is going to happen because I'm good.
*  Whatever that meant.
*  And when I started to learn more and read more and talk to people who were helping me, I remembered Buddy telling me that.
*  And back to those return stages, Andrew, it's just incredibly important for me to understand that my journey is not special.
*  We are part of a long history of evolution that people who go through very challenging.
*  I mean, the 17 stages in Joseph could not be more accurate to like, to my life, particularly the return.
*  And of course, if one looked from the outside, they would agree with your mindset then and say, you're alive.
*  You've certainly done very hard things, extraordinary things.
*  You're married, you got three kids, they're thriving.
*  PTSD, post-traumatic stress disorder, and things like it.
*  Because I don't think any single acronym or diagnosis can capture anything.
*  I think Paul Conti made that very clear to us in the mental health series.
*  These are names by necessity.
*  But it's a framework that certainly taught me something.
*  Absolutely.
*  And, and, and certainly those who haven't been in the military, maybe had a seeded vent of something challenging or whatever it is, you know, many people struggle with, with these kinds of things that live inside them in their nervous system.
*  They pack it down.
*  Maybe they don't.
*  But that was inside you at that point.
*  I think you and I first got acquainted in somewhere around 2016 when you and some other folks from tier one community and related communities started coming to lab.
*  And my lab, and I never really talked publicly about my lab has been involved with various things in Canada and the U.S.
*  I'm not trying to create any mystique there, but it's not not a point of interest what we did.
*  And, and, but I recall at that time just thinking like this guy's just an amazing team guy.
*  But in any event, you know, we got to know each other a bit.
*  And my sense then was like, it's like a, that's kind of indestructible, right?
*  You know, and now I realize nobody's indestructible.
*  We're flesh and bone.
*  But, but I think that's the thing.
*  Let's fast forward a bit to a couple years later.
*  If you're willing to talk about it, maybe talk about some of the evolution that happened.
*  So you started working a job, getting back into civilian life.
*  And I recall a conversation about this time of year.
*  And I was like, I'm not going to talk about that.
*  And I recall a conversation about this time of year, probably about three years ago.
*  Yeah.
*  And you had done what a lot of vets from tier one operations have done and are now doing,
*  which I actually have mostly favorable outlook on, which is there.
*  Now these are, I want to be very clear, legal and sanctioned explorations of the psychedelic space.
*  Right.
*  And I remember you called me and you described the experience that you had had and some of the connection
*  with warrior culture that that had helped emerge for you.
*  So could you explain what happened there?
*  You know, probably the entry, Andrew, is as important, you know, meaning it's not all about books,
*  but this is actually another thing I've really learned.
*  You know, I was very intellect and achievement central.
*  And as you can see how easy the emotion comes out now, I kind of very frighteningly understand people
*  who like feel stuff a lot more.
*  It's a whole other landscape.
*  It's miserable.
*  Well, wait, yeah, it is.
*  And yet it's, I agree.
*  It's a very uncomfortable space, you know, but we'll get there.
*  It's a journey for me.
*  I put it that way.
*  So, you know, there's a bunch of other, I'm a voracious reader.
*  I really enjoy it.
*  And, you know, my entree and little window into the world of getting that kind of help came from a lot of different areas.
*  I found in our area, a craniosacral therapist who it still seems like, because I mentioned it to people and it sounds fringe to them.
*  It's a very light touch, not even chiropractic like and it's closer to myofascial type of massage.
*  Some tapping.
*  Yep.
*  Very light tapping on the top of the head.
*  The part I actually love the most is the back of the neck sort of manipulation.
*  You're lying down relaxed.
*  Yeah, you're clothed.
*  Super easy in terms of that.
*  Couple years of that, just because of athletics, I love massage and that's kind of my entree.
*  So through the body, somatics.
*  Yeah.
*  Massage, frankly, in many ways is my favorite.
*  Back to the physical orientation to the world is what I, is what's useful to me.
*  But also, I mean, I read Sam Harris's first book, End of Faith, in 2006.
*  And so I've followed him for 15 years, religiously, read all of his books, Lying, Moral Landscape.
*  And his, I don't know him personally, so public stuff notwithstanding, that's not important
*  to me, but waking up and I took an online course with Robert Wright, who wrote Why Buddhism
*  is True, but that's really not what he's known for, you know, Princeton professor.
*  He's so funny.
*  He's very humorous.
*  And I started to work my way into, I don't have some like, I don't want people to think
*  whiz bang, like spiritual practice, whatever, you know.
*  But it became very interesting to me, Andrew, this, I needed to find, I started to realize
*  I needed to find a way to back away from the 24 hour ledge.
*  Like that super hyper focus, I needed to get a little bit of perspective.
*  One of my favorite short videos is Richard Feynman's Pale Blue Dot.
*  I needed to just back away.
*  That reminds me, thank you so much for talking about time-space bridging, I think, the other
*  day.
*  Yeah, we make, I'll cue people to that clip in the caption.
*  It's a way of taking oneself out of one's immediate sphere of vision and looking, literally
*  looking further out into one's environment and then back again as a perceptual exercise
*  of understanding that as our visual field expands, our perception of time also expands.
*  The binning, the chunking of time.
*  That, in mind your conversation years ago about horizon and activating the parasympathetic
*  system instead of sympathetic, I just very slowly started to realize I needed to back
*  away from the small picture and the reading and the craniosacrum size and I was still
*  not really getting consistent real help, but I thought I could do it through educating
*  myself intellectually.
*  I thought it was time to, and it was, it has short-term consequences but long-term it's
*  been amazing to deal with the plant medicines in a controlled and curated environment and
*  that experience was super safe and quite amazing actually, the weekend or the three or four
*  days was super intense, but I didn't leave there thinking, again, I kind of thought I'm
*  good.
*  That was great.
*  Yeah, a couple things.
*  One, we've covered psychedelics on this podcast before.
*  I say this not for liability reasons, but just really to emphasize for people's safety,
*  to protect them.
*  Plant medicines are illegal most places still.
*  This is changing.
*  MDMA has been filed with the FDA as a potential treatment.
*  It's not yet legal.
*  These things have great power to heal in the right circumstances and they also have great
*  potential to harm in the wrong hands or circumstances, people with potential for psychosis, etc.
*  With that said, I remember I was driving, I was on a phone call with you around this
*  time of year, three years ago, maybe it was four, but I think it was three years ago and
*  I said, what was your experience with Ibogaine DMT like?
*  You said, it was among the most profound experiences of my entire life and I recall you saying
*  that you felt that it had connected you through time to all the warrior cultures that had
*  preceded you, not just the US military, but all warrior cultures.
*  You sounded great.
*  You sounded better than great.
*  You weren't high, but you just sounded like, man, something had synced up.
*  I thought, this is great.
*  I hadn't explored plant medicines, at least not in a long time because I had done the
*  recreationally as a youth, which I do not recommend.
*  It took me down a bad path.
*  More recently, I've explored them in controlled conditions.
*  I thought, awesome.
*  This worked.
*  You got this new job.
*  You did some very controlled and again, physician assisted Ibogaine DMT experiences and you're
*  telling me how great everything was.
*  Then about, I think it was about three, four months later, I got a very different call.
*  If you're willing, I remember that call.
*  Maybe you can tell me about that call.
*  I mean, the experience, it was incredibly powerful.
*  Humor is such a powerful way to get through hard times, just why I'm laughing.
*  It really was, Andrew.
*  To be fair to thousands of years of people having experience with these things, we often
*  joked about what poor sucker reached out and grabbed that root for the first time and chewed
*  on it.
*  The Ibogatree, boy, he found out.
*  Or she.
*  Or she.
*  To be fair.
*  To be fair, probably some session that wasn't supposed to go that direction and someone
*  chewed on the wrong root.
*  It was extremely powerful.
*  I've heard that the 5-MeO for some people is not much.
*  It's like black.
*  For me, it was just liftoff.
*  I saw an entirely perfect geometric mosaic in light blue and white.
*  That was the warrior culture connection.
*  That whole 20-minute ride was just something else.
*  As you know, I guess—
*  I haven't done it, but—
*  —noetic is the word.
*  —noetic.
*  Yeah, that people use.
*  It's very difficult.
*  I don't have the language for it.
*  And a couple months later, the bottom dropped out.
*  Yeah, and I want to talk about that now.
*  I also want to emphasize I know a good number of people that have had the same experience
*  you did with Avigay and DMT through the Veterans Solutions Group.
*  I know Marcus and Amber Capone very well.
*  Actually, a bill just got passed in Congress that Dan Crenshaw helped spearhead to bring
*  funding to use of psychedelics for PTSD treatment in military.
*  I should mention, because this was interesting to learn, that that bill was highly bipartisan.
*  I'm not going to name off the names, because if I do, there's going to be a lot of cringing,
*  screaming, and yelling.
*  But if ever there was a bill that was supported from both sides of the aisle with the most
*  diametrically opposed names who came together around that funding, it's that bill.
*  It's striking.
*  So, this is a very bipartisan thing.
*  So, I will say a number of people have been greatly benefited by the Veterans Solutions
*  work.
*  And we can't causally link what happened to you afterwards to that at all.
*  There's a lot of contextual stuff.
*  So, we're not doing that.
*  But we're an open book here.
*  And I think that's a great group, by the way.
*  Veterans Solutions is amazing.
*  A few months later, you said the bottom dropped out.
*  So, what happened?
*  And when did you start to notice it?
*  And then maybe we can talk about that phone call.
*  I think, you know, looking back, Andrew, I think a couple things.
*  Most people who call me about, you know, friends who say, hey, should I go do this?
*  I initially tell them, well, 100% of the time, I tell them no, until, until you get...
*  I was having this conversation last week with a guy who I never met before.
*  You need to stabilize your situation, whatever your situation is, through some very slow,
*  deliberate Dr. Conte-level help.
*  Because in the case of...
*  I'm happy to see that some people are using just a wider spectrum of on-ramp, not the
*  nuclear option to start.
*  I can tell you, unequivocally, Ibogaine and 5-Meo DMT, two days apart, is the nuclear option.
*  And it's not right for everybody.
*  I'm not a scientist.
*  There's no question.
*  That cannot be right for everybody.
*  That just doesn't make any sense.
*  There's other ways to enter, I believe.
*  And when you say the Conte option, well, just for those that didn't see the series with
*  Dr. Paul Conte, we'll put a link to it in the show note captions.
*  But what Coleman's referring to is talk therapy with somebody highly skilled.
*  Yes.
*  And perhaps also prescription medication, if that's necessary.
*  Maybe hormone therapy, if that's necessary.
*  That's up to the physician.
*  But clearly, talk therapy with a skilled clinician.
*  I believe I needed...
*  I don't know what other people need.
*  I needed a mentor to help me contextualize what I was coming from and what I'm going
*  to.
*  And my experience with the plant medicines was it kicked the door wide open and took
*  that beautiful ice sculpture, perhaps at a person's wedding, and shattered it on the
*  floor.
*  And I was, again, left alone, my fault, not anybody else's, left alone to figure out how
*  to put that ice sculpture back together, piece by piece.
*  My belief is I could have avoided that by having a much more deliberate process.
*  So when suddenly the ice sculpture was on the ground, and every bit of intellect that
*  I built over however long, four decades, I was flat on my back.
*  And as I told you, Andrew, and I've been really verbal about with so many friends who only
*  want to talk about it in quiet circles, which I totally understand and respect.
*  And if you want to talk about it in a quiet circle, email the Human Life Podcast and you
*  can give them my cell phone number because I know how important it is to people in that
*  stage is that was another thing that I never thought was possible for humans.
*  It was severe depression, severe.
*  And I was so, because I guess I just never thought about it again, or never had a mentor.
*  The shocking thing, Andrew, was how shocked I was.
*  It was like if I had known something like this was real, not that I would have listened
*  to anybody if they said it, but the most shocking thing was that, again, this could happen to
*  me.
*  And when it did happen, I was completely unequipped to deal with, it took, forget how weak, forget
*  every other thing in my life, it took 10,000x the energy of anything I've ever done in
*  my life before to just put my feet on the ground in the morning.
*  I could not PT, I couldn't run, and you're like, I could not fucking function.
*  I did function somehow to some level, but it was so terrifying.
*  I just have, for anyone listening who has been through, I just have such incredible
*  respect for people who have dealt with it and have learned to get through something
*  like that.
*  Depression.
*  Oh yeah, or any, pick the title, right?
*  Whatever tough situation someone's in emotionally, I have such tremendous respect for them.
*  Because I would have been, years ago, the guy who like just tighten up your boots and
*  get to it.
*  It's not possible.
*  Like you have to get help from people who care about you.
*  And you have to step back away from the problem set somehow and work through it, step by step.
*  One of the most helpful things, and I feel so fortunate that I never really had the chemical
*  dependence thing.
*  It was easy for me to stop drinking.
*  When did you decide to stop drinking?
*  It was around three years ago or so-ish.
*  Prior to the slaps and depression.
*  No, no, right during.
*  Yeah, right during.
*  You just figured alcohol is a bad thing right now.
*  Yeah, and I mean, you and I have been friends for a while now, Andrew.
*  Some of the things you and I have discussed and I hear you talk about publicly, they were
*  just good reminders.
*  One of the things I absolutely hate, but I do every day, which is wait 90 minutes to
*  drink coffee.
*  Oh, it's the worst.
*  I cannot tell you how much of a difference that's made in my energy throughout the day.
*  And the drinking was similar.
*  Look, I'm just going to drop it for a couple weeks and then suddenly my sleep's better,
*  my fitness is better.
*  So, we all, even my friend, you chat about stuff.
*  Oh, what are you doing at this age?
*  I'm approaching 50.
*  That helps you stop drinking.
*  Everything else, all the other recommendations come second, at least for me.
*  Was that pretty easy for you to do?
*  Because I know there's a big culture of drinking in the teams.
*  Yeah.
*  I was just lucky.
*  So, my point there is just the respect I have for people who work through stuff like that.
*  And I was going to say the reason I reference the drinking is because I started reading
*  a lot about the 12 steps AA.
*  I've never been to an AA meeting, but the Simpson, the PTSD and the 12 steps, I'm like,
*  oh my God, this is me.
*  I need to go through these steps in my own way, not for drinking, but for whatever this
*  low-grade, the way I've described it as, you know, the Buddhist, obviously called dukkha,
*  it's unsatisfactoriness, this low-grade irritation that I carry around every day.
*  The one amazing thing that that couple of months did for me, and the way I described
*  it visually, is if someone cut me from neck to belly, inflate open my chest, and took
*  a propane torch and scorched me from the inside and then put me back together and said,
*  start over.
*  That's how it felt.
*  That's literally how it felt.
*  I mean, I could not believe, Andrew, and you can obviously, you know, Dr. Conti can articulate
*  this better, I couldn't believe how emotional pain could be so physically painful.
*  That whole experience, again, the shocking part was the shocking part.
*  I just didn't think it was real.
*  And so then when it was, and I'm like, how many fucking things do I have to deal with?
*  And I realized everybody deals with a lot of stuff.
*  And it was challenging.
*  And then slowly, you know, it got better and better.
*  And guys like, you know, friends, very close friends, a very, very small, tight group,
*  where, man, what people do when you finally tell them and you think, oh, this guy's gonna,
*  he's never gonna talk to me again.
*  They do the opposite.
*  They rally immediately for you, you know?
*  And then guys that aren't in your inner circle necessarily helping directly, and they're
*  in the next circle.
*  Because now, this is very weird, it's back to like the feeling thing.
*  I can, not 100% of the time, but a lot of guys in my community, if I speak to them and
*  they're in a bad spot, I can detect it within five seconds.
*  It's just the tonal and kind of like the tempo.
*  And when you tell that ring of people, not your super inner circle, they dump it immediately.
*  As soon as you open the door, they're like, hey, man, I had a couple of tough months,
*  you know?
*  Boom, they're right in, for the most part.
*  They open up.
*  Yep.
*  And that really scares me, Andrew, because I know, like, if we need to flip the switch
*  this afternoon, like, we can flip the switch.
*  Meaning?
*  Meaning, like, I can go to old school, you know, 15 years ago.
*  That's what you and I have discussed in the past, is kind of come back to, you know, the
*  fighter mentality is the problem with that, the hardcore, intense, focused, that's easy.
*  Like it's so easy to do that tough stuff.
*  That's easy.
*  This is the hard part.
*  And that's what, you know, was so challenging.
*  It was to go to people who normally we do, you know, the, yeah, yeah, let's do this,
*  let's do that, let's do something crazy.
*  Okay, well, tell that same person who you've built persona, identity, you know, around
*  them and with them, like, you're this guy.
*  And then you have a tough spot.
*  Now you have to go tell them the opposite.
*  Like I'm really not doing well.
*  It's terrifying.
*  It is terrifying.
*  And I, but I second with both arms your statement that when we actually open up to somebody
*  trusted, hopefully a friend or somebody close to us, but like some people go to clergy or
*  any number of the different resources and those resources really are out there at zero
*  cost.
*  They really are there.
*  If one has to look a little bit, sometimes a lot, unfortunately, but they're there.
*  My experience has always been and end up observing others that there's something about the human
*  spirit that wants to help.
*  And sometimes that help comes from somebody who's really been through it.
*  But even if somebody hasn't been through it, there's something in our nervous system that
*  sees real pain in somebody.
*  And contrary to what we think, they don't judge and think that everything that the person
*  who's hurting was before was a fraud.
*  The contrary, they see it as an act of strength.
*  But it feels like, like hell to reveal that it feels if, and I totally agree.
*  I think all the tough stuff, all the anything physical is like a fraction of the emotional
*  pain.
*  And thank you for highlighting the physical aspect of emotional pain, especially if one
*  isn't accustomed to it.
*  If one isn't accustomed to it.
*  If you're willing, how bad did it get?
*  The call we had suggested it was bad.
*  I sometimes refer to a line and I'd be lying if I didn't admit that I've seen that line
*  a few times in my life.
*  I've been right up next to it a few times.
*  And now if I ever see it, I know to do many things when it first comes into my visual
*  sphere, the line, of course, being the point at which one is considering taking their
*  own life.
*  Something that happens far too often even once is far too often.
*  And we've sort of skirted around this topic.
*  After all the wartime stuff and the gunfights and people dying in the doorbells, been a
*  lot of friends of yours and some of whom I know, but most of whom I don't, but to this
*  year who continue to kill themselves, to put it bluntly.
*  Where were you at with respect to that line?
*  Because depression is one thing.
*  There's mild depression.
*  There's severe depression.
*  There's recurring depression.
*  There's managed and on and on and on.
*  But ultimately that's the thing that hopefully everyone seeking to avoid.
*  And it's a yeah.
*  How close were you?
*  I would say there was probably I really want to say one day.
*  And the truth is it was one day.
*  It lasted one day.
*  Being that close to the line.
*  But it only takes a moment to go.
*  That's the scary thing, right?
*  And it probably lasted a couple of weeks, but there was only back to the buds thing.
*  Like I never thought about quitting.
*  I thought about it one day.
*  What was the thought?
*  I don't know.
*  It was I mean, sort of like the classic symptoms.
*  Andrew, I was up all night sweating and shaking and it's back to the shock of it.
*  It was OK.
*  I actually was able to like one of two things is happening.
*  Either I am fundamentally bad.
*  There's no way you can feel this bad and be good.
*  So one of two things is happening.
*  Like I'm just bad, a bad person, which I know is not true, or something bad got inside
*  of me that I have to get rid of.
*  And I don't know how to get rid of it.
*  And so sweating, shaking, you know, up at three in the morning and legitimately thinking.
*  This is just the scariest thing.
*  And for anybody in the situation, you think with every ounce of your being that people
*  are better off without you.
*  And then somehow, thankfully through chemistry, neurobiology, past learnings, I stepped back
*  away from that very quickly.
*  But the feeling of putting me up to that line didn't go away.
*  I just intellectually was able to.
*  It's kind of where the maladaptive behaviors, you know, back to training work in your favor,
*  which is I'm not quitting.
*  Like this can't be just me, even though it did feel like just me.
*  I mean, you suddenly become the core of the entire existence of the universe.
*  You think like you're it, you know, but in the negative side of it, not the adaptive
*  side of it, because the pain is just so extreme.
*  But I was able to back away from it.
*  And then over, I'm so grateful to so many of my friends.
*  I can't imagine how many hours if we collect up those hours, how much time I spent with
*  them on the phone.
*  And one of my in the like in those really hard weeks, maybe a little bit after that
*  and you're one of my buddies, it was actually just talking to him yesterday because I had
*  time in the car.
*  The tough love side of it, when you're feeling that poorly is a little tricky.
*  Like I wouldn't I probably wouldn't deliver tough love unless I really thought the person
*  could handle it.
*  I think it's you got to really deal with kid gloves at that those moments.
*  But one of my buddies told me, if you do something to hurt yourself, you will have proven to
*  every person who knows you that you are a fucking liar and a fraud.
*  Everything you've been about your whole life is a fraud.
*  And Andrew, I was we were on the phone.
*  I was like, whoa, my God, he just went tendering.
*  I mean, dead center.
*  That was a pivot.
*  Like that really helped me a lot.
*  That's what you needed.
*  I mean, I don't know that that's what I would have needed.
*  I recall when we spoke, because I obviously not professionally trained in any of that.
*  I just remember thinking, how do I put in this this in the language that Coleman's going
*  to understand?
*  And I just said, you know, I think your goggles are I know one thing for sure, which is that
*  your goggles are foggy.
*  So you got to so you have to outsource your decisions now.
*  I think you might have also told me to outsource my identity.
*  And that helped a lot because it was that idea of you have foggy goggles.
*  You're clearly like not on stable ground.
*  Everything you believe about yourself, just let it be the spokes of a wheel that somebody
*  else can hold for you for a period of time.
*  I was like, well, I can do that.
*  And then my other buddy, I didn't want to be a liar and a fraud.
*  I was like, I can do that.
*  And yeah, I mean, I'm grateful for the opportunity.
*  But unfortunately, I had a few circumstances where people close to me were at at that edge.
*  And I'd be lying if I say I've been at that edge.
*  So I knew where I had some sense of where you were at.
*  And under those conditions, I don't think there's a playbook.
*  I mean, obviously, when people have a plan and they're thinking about implementing that
*  plan, those people need to be put under protection from themselves.
*  Fortunately, it didn't come to that.
*  Yeah.
*  And you know, a few friends just did the basics, Andrew, which was I really wanted to talk
*  to you at that time because I knew you would give me some advice.
*  You know, I was so uncertain about just the I'll just say the chemistry, but the chemistry
*  and like something is not right.
*  Yeah.
*  And, you know, different friends offer different and some friends just.
*  Sat and listen to it all.
*  And when I think back, it's like.
*  I would take a bullet for them.
*  Because they just took it, you know, and let me offload it.
*  It's an amazing experience for people, let people help you.
*  Which I was never willing to do.
*  No, and you were we have to highlight something that might have been overlooked earlier
*  because we went through it quickly, but that you were, you know, you were commander of
*  a unit.
*  So you're head of a family.
*  I know Bridget's also head of family.
*  There's a there's a trade.
*  You go back to what's right.
*  Exactly.
*  But you're used to you're used to leading and protecting others.
*  And I think it's awesome that you're able to have access that that raise your hand asking
*  for help.
*  You have to.
*  It's such a sign of strength and skill and doesn't and it feels like the exact opposite
*  in the moment, the exact opposite.
*  And then we go to these narratives like, oh, if I've ever done that in the past, people
*  didn't help that, you know, we come up with a million excuses.
*  But in the end, it's it's it's such a thing of strength to do that.
*  So you did ratchet yourself out of that very, very dark hole.
*  And I want to place this in the context of this hero's journey.
*  Would you see that you talk about that, the magic flight that you're against, you're like
*  the refusal.
*  You won't go back.
*  But so it was accepting, it seems that there was some pieces of you needed work, that there
*  was this PTSD, this gentleman that you mentioned saw that and you refused to kind of deal with
*  it.
*  So shine a light on it and God, the universe, whatever your beliefs are, forced you to see
*  it.
*  Yep.
*  And you went to the very bottom, but not out the bottom.
*  Yep.
*  What was the process of putting things back together?
*  I mean, really, I mean, a lot of it, Andrew, was cutting out.
*  So as a practical matter, I mean, I'm going to go just go back to regular therapy because
*  I don't that.
*  I mean, my therapist is amazing.
*  She so you're not you.
*  At what point did you enter immediately?
*  They're immediately then.
*  So you got a quote unquote therapist because oh, yeah, yeah.
*  I mean, effectively.
*  You know, Bridget nine multiple at some point, it was it was pretty it was like this is this
*  is it like full time help effective immediately.
*  And I knew it was necessary, but if I'm really honest, like I would avoid it, I would have
*  somehow like tried to gut through the situation without like full time help.
*  And I mean, once a week therapy.
*  Yeah.
*  So the idea of sitting down with somebody and talking about past, present and maybe
*  some ideas of future was was worse to than jumping out and playing at three thousand
*  feet or going into a gunfight.
*  Not even close.
*  Not even close.
*  And hearing yourself say that, do you realize how ridiculous?
*  Well, how untrue that must be at the physical level.
*  But the nervous system doesn't know as to quote Dr.
*  Balconte, the limbic system that experiences or creates this sense of fear and dread doesn't
*  know the clock or the calendar.
*  It's like if you go the meaning, if you experience that, there's the idea that it's going to
*  go on forever.
*  I think that's the fear.
*  That's correct.
*  Yep.
*  That's exactly right.
*  Thank you for saying that.
*  The fear was this will go on forever.
*  But so, yes, I just did not want to, you know, back to Bessel van der Kolk's when I read
*  this word in his book, Body Keeps the Score of Lexothemia, if that's a real thing where
*  you can't put language to, you know, what's going on.
*  I didn't want to put language to it.
*  I couldn't.
*  I just didn't feel like it.
*  Like I just felt like gutting through it.
*  And then I got, you know, once a week therapy, amazing people.
*  And I don't know, Andrew, the first three months was, you know, I mean, gutting through,
*  I couldn't seem to shed that emotional burden of pick the category of stuff from the last,
*  let's just say 20 years.
*  It was just, but it was all, I couldn't stop it from coming out.
*  And obviously that's a good thing.
*  And so that just continued and every day got, and when I say this is the tough part for
*  at least me, and I know a lot of guys like me, the gains are minuscule, you know, but
*  things improved slowly but surely.
*  Were there ever moments where you felt you were drifting backward?
*  Not really.
*  And that was nice.
*  You know, you see that there's some stall, you know, plateaus.
*  You don't have to share this, but because I'm a believer that talk therapy can be very
*  effective.
*  I wouldn't be here if it weren't for two in particular amazing people who really helped
*  me along the way, but in that way.
*  But I do think there's a place at times for pharmacology to assist the process.
*  I know nowadays people here SSRIs and they demonize those.
*  That wasn't, I'll come clean.
*  So and then maybe if you feel like it, you can.
*  I had a bout of depression in my, during my postdoc did a short run of Welbutin and Bupropion,
*  which is more of the dopaminergic noradrenergic agonism, mostly adrenaline noradrenergic.
*  It really helped.
*  It nuked my memory at the dosage they suggested, which meant I had to take a very low dose.
*  And then eventually I came off.
*  And I think that that's one thing I learned from Conti, which is that most of these medications
*  were designed to help people get over a bump as opposed to be taken continuously.
*  Some people need to take them continuously.
*  I have been able to be away from that for a long time, but I think pharmacology can
*  help.
*  Oh yeah.
*  I think I'd have to go back and look four months maybe of pretty low dose of Welbutin.
*  Thanks to, yeah.
*  Yeah, that's about right.
*  Yeah.
*  Thanks to my buddy, Jimmy.
*  I called him and asked him what he thought.
*  He said, well, you use a gun sight on your weapon, don't you?
*  And you use glasses if you can't see.
*  No, I need reading glasses.
*  You need glasses if you can't see, right?
*  He's like, just fucking take the Welbutin, man.
*  Chill.
*  Just get it.
*  Get some space back to the space time bridging concept.
*  Just get back away from the danger for a few months.
*  That really helped.
*  And that's very different than the backing away from the danger with say alcohol or drugs.
*  And look, my stance on cannabis is some people can use it safely.
*  Most people probably cannot, but some can.
*  But there's something different about the drugs that have an addiction potential or
*  the drugs that disrupt sleep.
*  Like ultimately, if you look at people who commit suicide, and I've spent a lot of time
*  with this literature, in almost every case in the preceding weeks, there's a disruption
*  in sleep schedules, meaning disrupted from what they were doing prior to that when they
*  were not feeling suicidal.
*  So then you think about alcohol disruption of sleep, even if you think you're sleeping.
*  There's a story, like a common theme starts to emerge.
*  So you stabilize sleep, you were getting some dopamine and neurodegenerative assistance
*  from the low dose Welbutin, and you're basically also just letting it all out with a therapist.
*  With a therapist.
*  And the thing that strikes me as, to your point about my resistance to therapy versus
*  jumping out of airplanes or whatever, the most important people in my whole life since
*  day one have been people that have helped me.
*  Coaches, parents, friends, Doug, work colleagues, the guys that I work for now.
*  You have all these people helping you, and then you hit this thing that's so unusual.
*  I'm like, I don't want anybody to help me, and I don't want to tell anybody about it.
*  I was like, what is that, Andrew?
*  It's like, what is that?
*  And it's not like I wasn't in these environments where I've been coached and mentored.
*  I've had coaches and mentors on my ass my whole fucking life.
*  Like instructors, you know, it's a nonstop.
*  And I don't know, I just couldn't do it until I did it.
*  And then, you know, it's been a process since, and I'm super grateful for it.
*  And I don't know where we are in the journey, in terms of like the hero's journey, but I
*  hope I'm at freedom to live some version of it because with my, this is dangerous because
*  I only say this like with my really, really, really close friends.
*  I know this is going to more people in my club.
*  I feel like a completely different person.
*  And none of that stuff really ever goes away.
*  It's all a process, right?
*  And I'm never going to stop the process.
*  But I don't even recognize myself in some ways anymore.
*  And that's been a good thing because in those times when I was just on the 24-hour horizon
*  sometimes, I just did not know what the fuck was going on other than exactly what I was
*  doing, you know?
*  And it's just an odd experience to be in a different place.
*  And it's scary to know that without that experience and without people really kind of forcing
*  me to get help and things forcing me, I might be doing the same stuff, which is a hard way
*  to live, you know?
*  Or worse.
*  Or worse.
*  Which has happened to many of our buddies, you know?
*  And I want to go retroactively hug them and collect them up in a net and say, guys, just
*  stop for a second.
*  You know, it doesn't have to go there.
*  Yeah.
*  I feel the yearning in that statement.
*  I suffer from a terrible, very destructive, debilitating desire to travel back in time
*  and fix things.
*  It's like I know I don't have my graduate advisor who unfortunately all three of my
*  graduate advisors are dead, but she used to say, my time machine's broken.
*  Anytime I'd raise something, you know, that could have, would have, should have, my time
*  machine's broken.
*  And we know that.
*  But I felt that statement in every cell of my body.
*  It's clear you would.
*  But you're also, in sharing this experience and this information, you're doing that now
*  in what we call in biology, in the intergrade fashion.
*  And you know, somebody, many people are going to hear this and cue to the recognition of
*  what's happened to them, hopefully before they get to that line.
*  Yeah, you have to.
*  And you just got to tell somebody, you know, it's like, it's crazy how simple that is,
*  Andrew.
*  I mean, it's like, I can't tell anybody.
*  I can't tell anybody.
*  And maybe we drill into this a little bit deeper because I think that this really speaks
*  to the global experience of being human where unlike a physical wound where, you know, if
*  you see bone exposed, you're like, this is pretty serious.
*  You know, we all have different thresholds for what we can tolerate in terms of pain
*  and seeing ourselves wounded.
*  We all don't have to decide what's the difference between hurting and injured.
*  But when it comes to psychological stuff, we don't know.
*  You know, we also are dealing with a world now where some people feel psychologically
*  injured by everything, you know, so that's the extreme there.
*  But what we're, I think, I think what comes through and I think people need to perhaps
*  highlight in their minds is when something's kind of nagging or scratching at you beneath
*  the, sort of that voice, what do you think that voice is?
*  I call it the low grade pain.
*  Okay, for me, it was, there was a low grade, just slight hot burning starting in 07, probably
*  before that, but it was for me, it was a weird mix, Andrew, of like an uncertainty, a seeking,
*  this just doesn't feel right.
*  Like it has to be fixed.
*  There has to be an intellectual and achievement way to sort of get around, this is where the
*  Buddhist writing and thinking really helped me a lot.
*  There has to be a way around this low grade unsatisfactoriness somehow.
*  My sense for me, and I'm obviously not, you know, the Dr. Conti in the room, just because
*  of all the things I've learned, it just had to be this constant, I'll use the word trauma,
*  but for me, it was like something had to happen to our system, obviously it does, something
*  happens to our system that is a little bit of a, boom, there's a shock there, boom, and
*  then a buddy gets killed and then it's not even always with that, then you have extreme
*  firefight or, you know, close call and then it's just boom, boom, shock, shock, shock,
*  shock.
*  It's almost like getting TBI for the nervous system.
*  It's just a constant high, to me it always felt like that constant high end.
*  Now if you keep going, perhaps, if you never recognize any of it and you just keep jacking
*  the dopamine and the adrenaline your whole life, maybe you can just never recognize it,
*  but for me, when I shut the engine off and I decided it's not really how I wanted to
*  live and I was trying to work out of that low grade, whatever residue that I was left
*  with, it was like every time I came home from deployment, I would get sick that night, like
*  I would have a fever that night, headache and fever, and I tend to get sick at the end
*  of the year, last two years it was Christmas, this year it was Thanksgiving, and you know,
*  Bridget and I always joke about it, it's because I slightly turned the engine down a little
*  and then the immune system.
*  Yeah, that's the way it works. Everyone thinks stress depletes the immune system and indeed
*  it can, but if you think about it in evolutionary adaptive ways, go, go, go, go, go, allows you
*  to stave off the infection or at least to not have the symptoms of combating infection
*  and then when you relax a little bit, go on vacation, boom, you get sick, which is not
*  to say constantly stress, but you need to modulate, you got to modulate, but when you're
*  on deployments, you don't have the option.
*  No, you don't.
*  You're in gunfights every year.
*  Yeah, so as soon as you turn it off, you get sick, right, but for me in this particular
*  instance, what do I think it is? I think it was all of those experiences at once, turning
*  the generator all the way off, or the electric panel fully off, and then it just all came out.
*  Well, for people or anyone listening who is facing that feeling, that underlying feeling,
*  or who is challenged with like a breakup, loss of a loved one, fear about the future,
*  languishing because they don't know what the future holds, or the feeling that quote
*  unquote so much has happened, or some combination of those five things, where do you think the
*  healing process starts?
*  I hope, again, back to the Hero's Journey, I hope for every single person that it's not
*  a rock bottom moment, but it seems like if you follow a lot of, enough people, and you
*  hear enough stories, you talk with Dax, right?
*  Dax Shepard.
*  Yeah. He talks about it nonstop. Like unfortunately, I think aversion of bottom is where the process
*  starts. All the people I know, the stories they tell me, the process started when they
*  hit some version of bottom. What's the quote that I love is, you don't change until the
*  pain of staying the same is worse than the pain of change.
*  Amen to that. I have experienced that more times than I would like to admit, and that
*  brings me actually to this more macroscopic question. My understanding of the Hero's Journey
*  from obviously I haven't read or listened to the book is that we don't complete this
*  cycle and then rest at the ordinary world where we are living in bliss and peace forever.
*  We actually have to go around that wheel over and over and over again, hopefully not going
*  to bottoms that put our lives in danger, but it is not a process in which we ever really
*  get to cruise. Let's orient Coleman Ruiz in that cycle. You seem to have returned to
*  the ordinary world for those listening and not watching, even whenever you describe the
*  feeling of getting through, but also that people assisted you, you smile. As friendly
*  a guy as you are, I think in the first three years I knew you, I didn't see you smile once.
*  That's probably true. I didn't see you smile once. I just thought, man, these tier one
*  team guys, they're serious. They're locked in. They're locked in, but you smile a lot
*  now. I think you're back in the ordinary world. What are the things you're watchful
*  for? You're not drinking, you pay attention to your sleep. You always trained, you always
*  did it. You call it PT, but physical training. Cycle run. Swim, lots of kettlebells. Every
*  morning? I train probably five out of seven days and the two days that I don't train,
*  I have a sauna at my house. I'm in the sauna at least for an hour.
*  So funny how team guys talk about getting into cold or getting in the sauna. It's just
*  a regular thing. They never post it to social media. For them it's just part of the routine.
*  But I say that because I think a lot of people think it's this esoteric biohacking thing.
*  Wrestlers and people in the military are accustomed to sauna cold, sauna cold just like cardio
*  lifting weights. It's not this esoteric thing.
*  I think on average there's a sauna in Finland for every single person in the country. We
*  didn't invent some amazing recovery process by doing sauna.
*  What do you think it is about physical movement that helps the mind? Obviously I consider
*  it necessary but not sufficient. You need to do the talk therapy, the working through,
*  the writing, the reading, the introspection, the talking to other people, maybe pharmacology.
*  It does seem to be so important for resetting us. What do you think it is about physical
*  movement?
*  Since it might go back to John Rady's little anecdote in Spark, the sea squirt I guess
*  swims around and as soon as it does whatever it needs to do it just dies when it stops
*  moving.
*  Oh yeah. So the sea squirt is this aquatic animal, aplesia as it were, that when it lands
*  on a rock and stops moving it actually digests its own nervous system. That movement is the
*  great Nobel Prize winning scientist Sherrington that said that movement is the final common
*  pathway that movement is the way that the nervous system tells the brain and rest of
*  nervous system that it's still needed here on earth. Which I like. It reminds us of our
*  own utility in a neural way.
*  I mean whatever that is, Andrew, right, the chemistry and the neurobiology of it all,
*  this goes back, again, going back to seventh grade, I was at the end of the rope on the
*  detentions and the suspension and I have this very clear memory that before my dad got home
*  like I ran laps, I don't know how many but a lot, around the block and by the time he
*  got home I was like, whatever my punishment is, I'm good. Like I'm not worried about it.
*  That physical activity for me all the time, I don't want to overdo the runner's high thing
*  but whatever that is, that's what I think it is. Like when I'm in motion or my heart
*  rate's up, for the most part, everything's fine. And I'm clear headed and I cannot be,
*  again, dropping and drinking, I can't be lethargic and sit around. Like I have to take care of
*  myself in that regard. I watch my sleep super close if it gets past 10.30, I'm in like a
*  full blown panic, I need to get to a pillow. The basics, like I don't do anything crazy
*  really. You eat what you want? No, no. I would say on the neurotic scale of things, that's
*  probably my most extreme. There's probably a little bit of cutting weight, kind of like
*  eating disorder issues if I was guessing. Not that extreme. Do you eat meat, vegetables?
*  Yeah. Yeah, yeah. But I'm a really light eater. I eat like a bird and probably eight times
*  a day maybe more. Eight times a day? Oh, easily. I'll have, you know, I'll have a little bit
*  of coffee. Thanks to you, I'll wait an hour and a half to have coffee, which is miserable.
*  You're welcome. But it's amazing. Thank you. It's helped me so much. Well, you know, I
*  take some shit for it because some people say, do I have to? Well, if I train first
*  thing then I'll have my coffee first thing. It was really to stave off the afternoon crash,
*  but a lot of people find that experiencing that natural wake up and look, it's 90 minutes.
*  It's not like cutting it out for two days or two weeks. Michael Paul and I think quit
*  coffee and I was like, why in the world would you do that? Yeah, why in the world? I love
*  coffee, love Yerba Mate, always have from first sip, which by the way, I had my first
*  gourd of Mate, caffeinated Mate when I was four. There's a picture of me and my grandfather's
*  up. That's hilarious. Argentine side. Yeah. So, but the point here is that, you know,
*  these practices, these things, I think that they were involved a little bit of discipline,
*  but they really can't have an outsized effect, I think. Oh my goodness. Yeah. It's incredible.
*  I mean, the eating thing and then maybe, you know, one more mental thing in this regard,
*  I'll probably have maybe an avocado in the morning and then two hours later, maybe one
*  hour later, I'll have sliced cheese and an apple and then... So you're a light grazer.
*  Really light. I'll probably have the smallest plate at dinner in my house. We've always
*  been in great shape, like visually, you're tall, you're lean, you're strong. Yeah. I
*  think we're realizing now that you can still train on, you have to be like gorging oneself
*  with calories. Yeah, especially now, right? Like we're both approaching 50. It's actually
*  surprising how much I've discovered we can do on how few calories. And I'm not trying
*  to like test it some crazy way, but then just eat throughout the day. And you know, macro
*  life experience, Andrew, I just cut a bunch of extra bullshit out of my life, big end
*  little things like I don't... I try to just do my job and, you know, do a good job at
*  it and hang out with my people, friends and family and all the extra shenanigans. Like
*  I'll maybe do, you know, I was always doing some big race or some big mountaineering adventure
*  or I was just piling stuff into my schedule. I might do one race in like in the spring.
*  Everything else is casual, work really hard at it. I like cycling a lot. It's one of
*  my favorites and go hard, but I'm not trying to race cat too or, you know, win some event
*  or that release of extra bullshit in my life has been as big as anything else. And your
*  boys presumably take some time and attention in your... Yeah, they're great. Yeah. Your
*  son's a runner for university level runner. A lot of our conversation gets to some kind
*  of core features of being human and the psychology of challenge and thinking one is or others
*  are invincible, discovering that none of us are invincible, but that we are renewable.
*  You clearly illustrate that. There's clearly a message that everyone is invincible. And
*  everyone is gleaning from this many messages, but like what if any revision or adaptation
*  do you think we need of the concept of being a man, growing oneself into a man? You know,
*  I'm not a gender studies sociologist, psychologist, neuroscientist, but setting all the sociology
*  and the nomenclature aside, like if you had a short list of things, like it seems like
*  you believe that it's important to be able to do hard things, but sometimes those hard
*  things are not the hard things that you aren't... We think they are like sitting down and telling
*  one story being more terrifying than going into gunfights overseas. Yeah. Yeah, I mean,
*  it's funny that the prelude a little bit is I'm not a gender studies scientist either
*  or a sociologist. I stay away from most of these conversations, you know? But they're
*  barbed wire. Yeah, they just, people seem to be so over-activated over stuff. It's very
*  odd. But for me and my life experience, Andrew, it's range. I like to use David Epstein's
*  book title, right? It's range. And I've noticed this so much because of parenting and watching
*  my boys grow into men. If I think about, I'm going to come back to range, if I think about
*  myself at 17 or 18, not my parents, not my coaches, unless I really wanted it, you could
*  not fucking tell me what to do. You can't tell me what to do now. Like if I wanted,
*  I love the mentoring and the teammateship and the things that get you where you want
*  to go. But if it's something I don't want to do, I'm not doing it, you know, no matter
*  what. And so if I think about that in terms of being a dad or manhood is, let's take it
*  back to my kids, like I think one of the most important parts of my job is to release the
*  grip and take the reins off and just barely keep them inside the boundaries of a lot,
*  alive, you know, because they're going to make all their own decisions anyway and they
*  have to. And so I think a big part that I see and I saw myself a lot for years was we
*  over grip sometimes as men, like we are so afraid of losing control in an already uncontrollable
*  world that we over grip everything. And I over gripped everything and suddenly when
*  I'm not over gripping stuff, things are going better. And when it comes to range, it's
*  okay for me, it's okay to have your tough guy moments, your fighter mentality moments.
*  I would never want to lose that because no matter how much help I get when I'm out with
*  my family or my wife or my boys, my head is on a fucking swivel and if somebody touches
*  them, it's curtains. And we need to keep that because that is just a part of life. Like
*  you have to be, you cannot move through life with blinders on. Like there are people who
*  are not good people and it's okay to have range and have that in your toolkit. What
*  I don't think is okay to do is to let that slice of the traditional, whatever you want
*  to call it, aggressive manhood be your whole life. Like that's just not functional. You
*  know, it's not good for relationships, it's not good for parenthood. So every other little
*  tool you can put in that toolbox that takes you all the way over here to what we might
*  consider, oh Coleman's good, he's soft now. No, no, don't mistake my kindness or weakness.
*  There's a category for everything and I think that makes you such a much more complete person.
*  It's made me a more complete person. It's difficult. I feel like I'm brand new at being
*  able to do other things in my toolbox. Like this part's easy. I can go jump to that in
*  a nanosecond. This part over here of normalizing life across whatever, 80, 90, it's really
*  hard to sort of excavate the normal shit. But that's what I think we need to do. You
*  know what I mean? It's okay to be kind and calm and gentle and you know, there's nothing
*  wrong with that.
*  And I'm guessing the word surrender probably held a far different meaning for you in the
*  past. A lot of what you're describing is surrendering to the realities of life that we can't control
*  everything. And just how painful it is to undergo that surrender and here I'm talking
*  to myself too. It's a process I'm still deeply involved in as somebody who's tried to go
*  rung over rung as best I can.
*  Doesn't Andrew speak to our evolutions? That is so difficult, at least for me and guys
*  like me. I'm putting you in my group here. That is so hard to do. That just tells me
*  more about the evolution of our male system. Like that part's so easy and this part is
*  not so easy. But man, it's a battle to remind myself, you know, slow down, listen, just
*  the basic shit. You don't have to go attack every problem like a fist fight. It's tough.
*  It is tough and I think that the more that I resist surrender, the more that, well I
*  believe in God so I'll just say God, but God the universe or whatever it is for people.
*  But for me the more that God places me in circumstances that make the act of surrendering
*  harder. Like if I would just do it on my own it wouldn't have to be so hard. I wouldn't
*  have to, a good friend of mine, I'll mention my name, Tim Armstrong, he just said like
*  you gotta hit every branch on the way down. He was putting me on the line. He was like
*  you're a stubborn punk rocker, you have to. And he was talking about himself too. There's
*  certain phenotypes where we have to but like the universe just screams out, you don't have
*  to. You can actually just like lower yourself down on a rope to the ground and walk away
*  but then there's that stubbornness. But I think that the stubbornness has its evolutionary
*  adaptations too and the hero's journey, nothing in the hero's journey says that the transitions
*  between these different states are linear, are of equal duration, are of certainty, only
*  that they exist and that there's no way as you pointed out before to skip steps.
*  You can't skip. I couldn't skip. If somebody skips, I mean it's like you hit every branch.
*  But nobody skips. And whether or not somebody tries to skip through psychedelics or through
*  being the toughest or through the acquisition of money or just focusing on family, you know
*  family obviously is super important but that's not going to accomplish the other aspects
*  of the journey. It's a huge part of it but it's not the only part. Again, necessary
*  not sufficient.
*  Yeah, it's like again, it's the 12 steps or some I'm not that experienced in and I just
*  read about it a decent amount. It's like hitting every branch. You got to follow the steps,
*  man. Or you can live with that low grade pain nonstop. You know, it's not a good way to
*  live.
*  No, because even if you're not conscious of it, it erodes you in ways that are very destructive.
*  I wasn't conscious of it at all, you know, until the universe, as we say, came in with
*  a fucking wrecking ball and said, fine, you're not going to listen? Sent you all these messages,
*  you're not going to listen? Okay.
*  I think it's important that we at least briefly touch on where things are at right now because
*  it would be remiss for us to give the impression that like you're sitting there meditating,
*  you're drinking your coffee 90 minutes late, late after you wake up, you're sitting there
*  in bliss and thinking about all the great things that happened, how you made it through.
*  Like there's still a lot happening right now. So to the extent that you can share, you're
*  working all the time. What are you doing nowadays as a vocation?
*  I was in private equity for a while before I met you, run a company for companies for
*  really good friend of mine named Tom Ripley, amazing guy. And then I stepped away because
*  I was exhausted and I didn't know how to say it. I didn't know how to tell anybody.
*  Like I needed to escape again, take magic flight somehow, you know, and he and I are
*  incredibly close. Like he was one of the guys who is in that super tight inner circle.
*  And then I came back to it with, you know, with this team that I'm on and serve as the
*  chief operating officer at LID Sports Group, the largest brick and mortar licensed sports
*  retailer in North America. We have 2000 stores during the holiday. We have 8200 employees
*  and amazing team. The private equity firm that I work for is an amazing team and the
*  company is an amazing company and just incredible group of folks. And so yeah, I work a lot.
*  I was out here doing store visits in San Francisco and LA and that's, it's all good. And I think
*  I do those little things all day long, all the time, but no, I am not sitting on a mountaintop
*  like most days. There's no meditation at all, Andrew. It's meditation as a workout. Tom
*  and I throw kettlebells around multiple times a week and I do those other little things.
*  But the difference for me is I'm okay with it. And I say that because I was incredibly
*  busy, you know, before when I first got out of the Navy and I wasn't okay with it because
*  I thought, again, this is back to the hero's journey. I thought like the return to ordinary
*  life was going to be sunshine and rainbows. Like, look, I have the ultimate boon. I had
*  this big experience, not that I wanted to be like front and center in the media, but
*  here I am world. It's calm out here, right? Like we get to chill and have a good time
*  and sleep and nothing is stressful in the real world, right? Wrong. I just wasn't ready
*  for that. Like I really genuinely thought that it was just going to be easier. And so
*  when we talk about the low grade pain injury and like the, you know, what is that? To me,
*  that was one of the biggest frictions. Like, holy shit, I did all this stuff, all these
*  deployments, lost all these buddies and there's no fucking rest. Like the regular world just
*  not, it's supposed to be easier. At least that's the story that was in my mind. Going
*  through all the stuff we just talked about. Now I'm okay with it. Like I like it. I know
*  how to manage my life. I know how to manage my time for the most part. I have a different
*  relationship with my teammates and my mentors and my bosses and my own work life. And I
*  love it. Like I feel like I'm back to in a very different way where I was when I was
*  in the squadron back in 07. Like I feel like I'm on, hope this doesn't get clipped, but
*  for me, I'm on another level. Like I really feel good about where I'm headed. And I haven't
*  felt like that since I went into college. You know, I felt like shit was just deteriorating
*  and now it's not, which is nice.
*  With the beauty of what you just said and everything you've shared today is that, I
*  don't know if it occurs to you or not, but you've been providing mentorship to millions
*  of people in the form of sharing your experience of your own hero's journey. And I want to
*  thank you for making it so clear as to what your experience was and being unafraid or
*  perhaps afraid and doing it and telling us anyway exactly what that felt like.
*  Even better in that sense, you know, and stepping into that fear, but also making it so clear
*  that while your life experiences, you know, extraordinary, SEAL teams, tier one teams,
*  and all of it, that everyone's life has these components of extraordinary and the opportunity
*  for extraordinary and the return and renewal through the ordinary world. So much of what
*  you shared has meaning regardless of people who are male, female, young, old. So thank
*  you for being a mentor today and for having the bravery for stepping out into the quote
*  unquote ordinary world, which is oh so unordinary.
*  Unordinary.
*  Unordinary. And if you're willing, I think it'd be great to have you back in maybe a
*  couple of years and see where you're at. Meanwhile, you and I will be in touch often as we frequently
*  are.
*  Thanks, Andrew. Appreciate it.
*  Coleman Ruiz, thanks for everything you've done.
*  Thank you.
*  Thanks for everything you're doing. And thanks for coming out today and sharing with us what
*  real life's about.
*  It's always great to see you. Appreciate the time. It was a joy. Thanks.
*  Likewise.
*  If you have questions for me or comments about the podcast or guests, you'd like me to consider
*  hosting on the Huberman Lab podcast, please put those in the comments section on YouTube.
*  I do read all the comments, not so much during today's episode, but on many previous episodes
*  of the Huberman Lab podcast, we discuss supplements while supplements aren't necessary for everybody.
*  Many people derive tremendous benefit from them for things like improving sleep, for hormone
*  support and for focus to learn more about the supplements discussed on the Huberman Lab
*  podcast. Please go to livemomentous.com slash Huberman.
*  If you're not already following me on social media, I'm Huberman Lab on all social media
*  platforms. So that's Instagram, X, LinkedIn, Facebook and threads. And on all those platforms,
*  I share science and science related tools, some of which overlaps with the content of
*  the Huberman Lab podcast, but much of which is distinct from the content of the Huberman
*  Lab podcast. Again, that's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
*  If you haven't already subscribed to our neural network newsletter, our neural network newsletter
*  is a zero cost newsletter that provides summaries of podcast episodes, as well as protocols in the
*  form of one to three page PDFs, protocols on things like deliberate cold exposure or optimizing
*  dopamine, improving your sleep, neuroplasticity and learning. We have a foundational fitness
*  protocol that details cardiovascular and resistance training workouts. And all of that is available
*  to you completely zero cost. You simply go to HubermanLab.com, go to the menu tab, scroll down
*  the newsletter and provide your email. We do not share your email with anybody. Thank you once
*  again for joining me for today's discussion with Coleman Ruiz. And last but certainly not least,
*  thank you for your interest in science.
