# Asi Wind: What Magic & Mind Reading Reveal About the Brain
**Andrew Huberman:** [March 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpTJqwIfHcM)
*  Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
*  where we discuss science
*  and science-based tools for everyday life.
*  I'm Andrew Huberman,
*  and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
*  at Stanford School of Medicine.
*  My guest today is Ossie Wind.
*  Ossie Wind is one of the top magicians
*  and mentalists in the world.
*  Now you may be asking yourself,
*  why would the Huberman Lab Podcast host a magician mentalist?
*  And the obvious answer perhaps would be
*  that magicians and mentalists reveal to us
*  where our gaps in perception reside.
*  That is where the human brain falters
*  such that magicians and mentalists
*  can take advantage of that and give us the impression,
*  the illusion that certain things happened when they didn't.
*  However, during today's discussion,
*  you will learn that Ossie Wind's magic and mentalist work,
*  which by the way is absolutely astonishing.
*  You can see examples of this
*  in some of the links in the show note captions
*  that will take you to YouTube clips
*  in which Ossie did some of these tricks and mentalist work
*  on me directly in the studio.
*  And there are other examples out there
*  that we've linked to on the internet as well.
*  That the work that Ossie Wind does
*  illustrates how we form memories,
*  how we erase memories,
*  and the specific things that we all can do
*  in order to stamp down certain memories
*  and to erase other memories.
*  Indeed, much of what Ossie Wind's work does
*  is to use an understanding of how the brain works
*  in order to create false memories,
*  to erase recent memories,
*  and indeed to use emotion and empathy and storytelling
*  in order for you, the observer,
*  to create a perception of something that happened
*  that may or may not have actually happened.
*  Indeed, what Ossie reveals to us today
*  tells us not how a magician or mentalist fools us,
*  but rather how we with our own brains
*  lead ourselves to believe that certain things happened
*  when in fact they may or may not have happened.
*  And the way that we collaborate with others
*  in order to create those either false or real perceptions.
*  It's a discussion that I'm sure everyone,
*  whether or not you're a fan of magic or not,
*  will find fascinating.
*  Indeed, I learned so much from the discussion with Ossie
*  about neuroscience and about how the human brain
*  constructs narratives of the past, present, and future,
*  that it informs not just my understanding
*  of how the brain works, but indeed how to learn better,
*  how to remember things better,
*  and to consolidate that information,
*  to really stamp it into your memory
*  so that you never forget.
*  So while Ossie Wind is a magician and mentalist,
*  today's discussion is really a discussion
*  about the neuroscience of how to learn,
*  how to forget, how to access creativity,
*  and how art and storytelling, empathy and emotion,
*  all can allow us to access powers within us
*  that make us far more effective
*  in whatever pursuits we may be after.
*  Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
*  is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
*  It is, however, part of my desire and effort
*  to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
*  and science-related tools to the general public.
*  In keeping with that theme,
*  I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
*  Our first sponsor is Element.
*  Element is an electrolyte drink with everything you need
*  and nothing you don't.
*  That means plenty of salt, magnesium, and potassium,
*  the electrolytes, but no sugar.
*  As I mentioned before on this podcast,
*  I'm a big believer in getting sufficient hydration
*  and making sure that the hydration
*  includes sufficient electrolytes,
*  salt, magnesium, and potassium.
*  And the reason for that is that all the cells in our body,
*  but indeed, especially our neurons, our nerve cells,
*  are critically reliant on electrolytes and hydration
*  in order to function properly.
*  Element makes it very easy to get the hydration
*  and electrolytes you need.
*  When I wake up in the morning,
*  one of the first things I do is to drink 16 to 32 ounces
*  of water with a packet of Element dissolved in it.
*  I particularly like the raspberry flavored Element,
*  but then again, I also like the watermelon flavor
*  and the citrus flavor and the orange flavor.
*  So basically what I'm saying is
*  I really like all the flavors of Element.
*  If you'd like to try Element,
*  you can go to drinkelement, spelled lmnt.com slash Huberman
*  to claim a free sample pack with your order.
*  Again, that's drinkelementlmnt.com slash Huberman.
*  Today's episode is also brought to us by BetterHelp.
*  BetterHelp offers professional therapy
*  with a licensed therapist carried out online.
*  I've been going to therapy for well over 30 years.
*  Initially, I didn't have a choice.
*  It was a condition of being allowed to stay in school,
*  but pretty soon I realized that therapy
*  is extremely valuable.
*  In fact, I consider doing regular therapy
*  just as important as getting regular exercise,
*  including cardiovascular exercise and resistance training,
*  which of course I also do every week.
*  The reason I know therapy is so valuable
*  is that if you can find a therapist
*  with whom you can develop a really good rapport,
*  you not only get terrific support
*  for some of the challenges in your life,
*  but you also can derive tremendous insights
*  from that therapy.
*  Insights that can allow you to better,
*  not just your emotional life and your relationship life,
*  but of course also the relationship to yourself
*  and to your professional life, to all sorts of career goals.
*  In fact, I see therapy as one of the key components
*  for meshing together all aspects of one's life
*  and being able to really direct one's focus and attention
*  toward what really matters.

*  Today's episode is also brought to us by Aeropress.
*  Aeropress is similar to a French press for making coffee,
*  but is in fact a much better way to make coffee.
*  I first learned about Aeropress well over 10 years ago,
*  and I've been using one ever since.
*  Aeropress was developed by Alan Adler,
*  who was an engineer at Stanford.
*  And I knew of Alan because he had also built
*  the so-called Aerobi Frisbee.
*  So he was sort of famous in our community
*  for developing these different feats of engineering
*  that turned into commercial products.
*  Now, I love coffee.
*  I'm somebody that drinks coffee nearly every day,
*  usually about 90 to 120 minutes
*  after I wake up in the morning, although not always.
*  Sometimes if I'm going to exercise,
*  I'll drink coffee first thing in the morning.
*  But I love, love, love coffee.
*  And what I've personally found is that
*  by using the Aeropress,
*  I can make the best possible tasting cup of coffee.
*  I don't know what exactly it is in the Aeropress
*  that allows the same beans to be prepared
*  into a cup of coffee that tastes that much better
*  as compared to any other form of brewing that coffee,
*  even the traditional French press.
*  The Aeropress is extremely easy to use,
*  and it's extremely compact.
*  In fact, I take it with me whenever I travel
*  and I use it on the road in hotels, even on planes.
*  I'll just ask for some hot water
*  and I'll brew my coffee or tea right there on the plane.
*  With over 55,000 five-star reviews,
*  Aeropress is the best reviewed coffee press in the world.
*  If you would like to try Aeropress,
*  you can go to aeropress.com slash Huberman.
*  That's A-E-R-O-P-R-E-S-S.com slash Huberman
*  to get 20% off any Aeropress coffee maker.

*  And now for my discussion with Ossie Wind.
*  Ossie Wind, welcome.
*  Thank you for having me.
*  I can't tell you how excited I am to have you here today.
*  I've seen you do your live shows twice,
*  once in Los Angeles, once in New York.
*  And both times, there were three major effects.
*  First of all, I was absolutely astonished.
*  There's truly no hyperbole that can capture
*  what you are capable of doing.
*  Just by way of example, folks,
*  prior to coming in here, Ossie agreed to do a trick.
*  He let me select a card, an Ace of Hearts
*  from a deck of cards.
*  I held it.
*  There was another card, Ace of Diamonds.
*  I also held that.
*  I looked at them.
*  I turned them over in my hands.
*  He's not touching them.
*  He asked somebody in the room for a number,
*  number, number.
*  Everyone provides a number.
*  Then he asked me which person's number
*  I would like to select.
*  There's no prior agreements or communication here whatsoever.
*  I selected the number seven.
*  He says, turn over the cards that are still in my hands.
*  He hasn't touched me.
*  I turn over the cards and now they are sevens, not aces.
*  Unbelievable.
*  And yet it happened.
*  And that's but a minor example
*  of the sorts of things that you do.
*  So that's the first thing, absolutely astonishing.
*  Two, you involve many of the senses,
*  not just visual perception, memory, et cetera,
*  but many of the senses and groups of people.
*  You are able to somehow create perceptions in people
*  or perhaps these perceptions are accurate
*  that certain things have happened.
*  And everyone agrees that these things happen.
*  So it's not just one person being quote unquote tricked.
*  And then the third is that you and I both share
*  a fascination with the human mind and perception,
*  which is really one of the main reasons
*  why you're here today.
*  Because you are a scientist who I believe understands
*  how perception works, understands the gaps in perception
*  and memory and understands these things
*  at a practical level that no neuroscientist,
*  not I nor anyone else who could tell you
*  about the nuts and bolts of the brain
*  and nervous system could ever approach.
*  So welcome.
*  I'm super excited for our conversation.
*  And my first question is when you do a trick
*  with one person, with many people,
*  how confident are you that you're going to get
*  the answer correct?
*  Meaning are you always operating at the level
*  of 100% certainty that you're going to get it right?
*  Or rather is there a little bit of a gap?
*  Are you running like a 90% probability?
*  And the reason I start with this question
*  is that I think it's a very different situation
*  when the mentalist, the magician is certain
*  it's going to work out as opposed to when it's not.
*  And I think it's the dynamic tension of the possibility
*  that it might not work out that gets everyone
*  so engrossed in what you do.
*  Yes, so first of all, a lot of people think,
*  do you ever fail?
*  Do you ever get it wrong?
*  And the truth is there's something they don't know.
*  We're going to reveal some secrets here.
*  A lot of people don't know that we are very much
*  like jazz musicians.
*  I'm not a musician, I'm going to probably
*  butcher this analogy here.
*  But we write the story as it goes.
*  In other words, you might see me do a trick
*  and think that's what I do every day, but I don't.
*  So in other words, if something goes wrong,
*  because every person is really unpredictable.
*  I say take any card, maybe I'm trying to make you
*  take a certain card, maybe I'm trying to influence you
*  and you're not going for it.
*  I'm OK with making a little detour.
*  You just don't know I'm taking the detour.
*  And I'm improvising and I will go somewhere else.
*  And I'm OK with that.
*  So a lot of the magic that I love to do,
*  we call it jazzy magic, is magic that literally
*  gets written as we go.
*  But I'm the only one who knows it.
*  And you go, wow, it's concluded beautifully, right?
*  So there's some times after a show and I go, wow,
*  this did not work and that didn't work.
*  And people say, what do you mean?
*  Everything worked perfect.
*  They don't know.
*  What I see is a little different than what you see.
*  So in that sense, when you're an amateur magician
*  and you're just starting out and you don't have the experience,
*  you can literally just get stuck and go, sorry,
*  let's do it again.
*  And it could happen.
*  But for a seasoned performer, someone
*  who does it again and again and again,
*  I'll borrow from a pendulum analogy that I love.
*  It's like Groundhog Day, the movie.
*  We get to relive the same night again and again and again.
*  And guess what?
*  People are very much alike.
*  I'll hear the same heckling.
*  I'll hear the same thing.
*  Or I start to see types.
*  This person is going to be confrontational.
*  This person is a person who believes maybe in supernatural.
*  Everybody has a vibe.
*  And even though I'm not a scientist,
*  I'm not a psychologist, I don't have any degrees in any of those,
*  but I'm a practitioner of psychology.
*  I tried the same trick a million times
*  and I start to see patterns, behavioral patterns
*  that I can use to my advantage.
*  Like, for example, I noticed that it's easier
*  to fool smart people as opposed to people who are not so smart.
*  Tell me more about that.
*  Because I'm relying on the bank of information
*  you have in your head against you.
*  It's Tai Chi.
*  I know what you know.
*  And I know that whenever you view anything,
*  you have to fill in the blanks with lots of information.
*  I show you a couple of things and say, OK, this makes sense, this,
*  da, da, da.
*  And I know how you think.
*  And the fact that I have an idea of what you know and what you don't know,
*  I can use it against you.
*  And that's a beautiful concept, right?
*  As opposed to someone who's not so educated.
*  I don't know what he knows.
*  And they tend to think very simple.
*  And they're the ones to figure out magic the most,
*  because they don't fill in the blanks.
*  They take it for what it is.
*  You're telling yourself a better story.
*  You enriching the experience based on all this,
*  the wealth of information you have about psychology,
*  and how this works, and how perception works, and how memory works.
*  For example, you just described a trick I did for you.
*  You did not describe the trick.
*  You described your memory of that trick.
*  So my job, and I'm borrowing from my master, maestro, Juan Tamarith,
*  who's my favorite magician of all time.
*  And I consider him, we'll talk about him quite a bit now.
*  He taught me so much, but he talks a lot about memory.
*  First of all, we're encoding the information.
*  I give you something to encode.
*  Then I'm asking you to store it, either in short-term memory, medium-term,
*  long-term.
*  I don't know if it's even a real term, but a chemical memory, right?
*  When it gets embedded in your memory.
*  And then I'm trying to manipulate how you're going to recall the experience.
*  And what you did, you described my trick in a way that I could never do.
*  I wish I could perform the trick you just described.
*  I can't.
*  But I was trying to create at least the impression you recorded a feeling you had.
*  You did not record what you saw and experienced.
*  You recorded a feeling.
*  It felt so amazing that the feeling was coded in the memory as well.
*  And therefore, you were the co-author of that trick.
*  You helped me fool you.
*  I'm very curious about the role of emotion in the co-authoring of these tricks.
*  And by the way, folks, the conversation we're having today is not just about
*  magic tricks and mentalists.
*  This occurs at the level of interactions between people, one-to-one.
*  This occurs at the level of media to the general audience of the world.
*  This stuff scales at every level and in every domain of life.
*  We'll get to how exactly that occurs.
*  I wonder if I could ask you about the reverse engineering of a trick,
*  a hypothetical trick.
*  So tell me if this trick is possible.
*  And if so, one of the possible ways that you would do this.
*  I think I've seen you do something similar to this or other mentalists do
*  something similar to this.
*  You're standing in a room full of people, let's say 50 people, and you have a piece
*  of paper and a pen, and you say, okay, I'm going to write down a series of numbers.
*  And you write them down, you fold it up, you put it on a table next to you,
*  you set the pen down.
*  There's no contact with it anymore.
*  And then you go around the room and you just ask people for numbers between one
*  and 25.
*  You ask a certain number of people.
*  And then somehow you return to the paper, you open it up, and that's the sequence
*  of numbers.
*  It seems like a straightforward but astonishing trick.
*  It's a classic.
*  A classic.
*  Okay.
*  Classic of magic.
*  For people like me, we want to know at least one solution to that challenge.
*  What's one way in which a magician could do that?
*  Obviously, we start to go to the physical explanation.
*  Okay, somebody underneath the table that the piece of paper was on wrote down the numbers
*  they heard and put it on the table.
*  Another solution would be that there was a stack of papers up there with any number of
*  different combinations, but then it's a very large number, big stack of paper, then it
*  becomes hard to hide, and on and on.
*  All going in the wrong direction, of course.
*  I can also think of the end product way of doing this, where the piece of paper that
*  you show has the numbers that the people stated, but somehow we think it's those numbers when
*  it's actually other numbers.
*  Like there's some sort of visual illusion that we all agree on seeing.
*  But here I'm just guessing.
*  So how could one do that trick?
*  Wow.
*  We need two hours to dissect this one.
*  So here's the deal.
*  I just noticed something.
*  As you were going through all the options, as someone who I assume you're not a magician,
*  I just realized that a quality of magic is that it ignites your imagination and your
*  creativity.
*  You just basically saw something that has no explanation, and you're a knowledgeable
*  guy.
*  You know a lot about a lot of things.
*  And it in a weird, in a good way, bothers you.
*  Why don't I know that answer?
*  I know so much about the mind and how we sleep and how certain exercises affect our bodies
*  and blah, blah, blah.
*  But this series of numbers, I don't know.
*  And that drives you nuts a bit.
*  But it's good, because then your mind starts racing.
*  In thinking of everything you said is a wonderful exercise in problem solving.
*  How could be achieved?
*  And then you slowly rule them out as too much paper, too much work, hiring somebody under
*  a table to write maybe a solution, but you have to pay somebody just to do that job.
*  But it's nice, because we're teasing the mind.
*  We're challenging the mind in an era where it seems like all the information is out there.
*  My smartphone can do more than my first computer could, right, in my pocket.
*  So we are up against, and by the way, every time I tell you this, it's a bit of a tangent
*  here.
*  Every time technology advances, magicians get scared, say, oh, people are, they can
*  do all these marvelous things.
*  I mean, how are they going to care about the number you spoke or car changing in my hand?
*  And I attribute that to, again, your desire to see something marvelous.
*  By the way, there are people that don't want to see magic.
*  Like I do something that really seems impossible and they go, oh, slight of hand.
*  They come up with a very simple solution.
*  They're not nitpicking about exactly how you did it.
*  They go, oh, he's fast.
*  He's fast with his hands.
*  They come up with a very simple solution.
*  I don't know why it satisfies them, but it does.
*  And it's because they lock the desire to see magic.
*  So to me, again, and we're going back to the co-authoring, I really need someone, a partner,
*  whenever I do magic, someone who has this desire to see something that's beautiful,
*  that's going to bend the rules of what we know is possible, right?
*  And they're joining me.
*  So to your question, how is it done?
*  There's many, many ways to achieve this effect.
*  Because we don't possess, I don't know, we can talk about this if you want, about the supernatural.
*  I don't believe that anybody possesses supernatural powers or even close to that.
*  And because of that, we have to cheat.
*  We have to do some dirty work, which I don't want you to know about.
*  And so in other words, every trick that they do has a little scar, a little, a moment I wish did not exist.
*  And by the way, a magician, when they choose a trick like that, they need to say, oh, I can go this route or this route.
*  They're going to pay a price with this version.
*  Oh, I cannot do it this way. Here.
*  It's not as clean here. I cannot be as direct here.
*  I have to choose maybe certain people in the audience.
*  Again, I'm tiptoeing around it so I don't reveal how it's done.
*  But you're making a sacrifice with every choice you make.
*  The goal is at the end to make somebody as smart as you go, how?
*  It didn't start racing and at the end you reach a dead end, hopefully.
*  It's magic. You excel.
*  And I enjoy this. And that's I want you to surrender.
*  And it's a good surrender. It's not you're not being defeated.
*  You give in to this place where magic could happen.
*  You make room for something that should not happen in this world to happen.
*  And that's why I love magic so much. It is a bit of a reminder that I'll tell you a story.
*  There is a juggler who is not a magician.
*  He's and I'm not going to mention names for a reason.
*  So he juggles on the streets and, you know, makes some money on the streets.
*  One day he goes to see a magic show.
*  And the magician, a wonderful magician, who does this wonderful act, it's the zip code act.
*  He says to people, tell me your zip code.
*  And then he tells them where they live. Tell me where you live.
*  He tells them the zip code. And then he describes places around them.
*  Oh, you have a Starbucks there and a bubble. And like he describes, it's amazing.
*  It's wonderful.
*  Now, this juggler, not a magician, watches a magician who is doing a trick.
*  There's a scientific explanation to how it's done.
*  It's not it's not anything beyond that.
*  And again, it's wonderful.
*  And he goes, how did he do that?
*  And then he comes up with the solution that the magician must have memorized all the zip codes in the world.
*  Not the case, but that's the impression.
*  He goes home and starts memorizing all the zip codes in America first.
*  He spends thousands of hours to memorize zip codes for real.
*  He's doing the real version of what the magician did.
*  And he performs it now.
*  All over the country, he's doing the zip code act for real.
*  And the beauty of this story is that a false performance, artificial representation of a skill,
*  inspired somebody to do something that is real and therefore push its limits,
*  is human, you know, realistic limits to a level that a lot of people go, that's not possible.
*  Right. And I think it's a beauty about this.
*  And again, goes back to your question, how is it done?
*  So maybe the solution you just came up with is better than what I do.
*  But I just ignited you to think about it.
*  So it's really a big reason, an important reason why I love magic so much.
*  Staying with my question of how a trick like that is done.
*  You really want to know.
*  Well, I don't think you're actually going to tell me the specific order of operations to make it happen.
*  I don't expect that.
*  But I can think of two kind of endpoints for exploring this.
*  One is, or at least two, one is to manipulate what's on the paper.
*  Right. Like the other is to manipulate what people say or are likely to say,
*  perhaps by selecting people that are likely to say certain numbers, because you have some understanding of that.
*  I don't know how that would happen.
*  The other is to completely revise people's understanding of what just happened in a group.
*  And I think the last possibility is the one that intrigues me and most people the most,
*  the idea that even in the company of other rational, well-rested, sober, meaning non-inebriated or on drugs people,
*  that there could be a collective perception that is not accurate, but everyone agrees to confabulate together.
*  And the reason I ask this and I focus on this third possibility is that we know that the memory system is a confabulation system.
*  A good example of this would be people who sadly have some form of dementia.
*  They often will find themselves in a room doing something.
*  And if you ask them, hey, what were you doing?
*  They don't say, I don't know.
*  They say, oh, you know, I came in here to do something.
*  And they create these elaborate stories of what got them there, which may make sense to them, may not.
*  But we all do this. We all confabulate.
*  False memory is a huge topic into itself, but we all confabulate.
*  Memory is not perfect.
*  So I imagine this third possibility is one that you work with and that you massage.
*  How does one think about memory in the context of these experiments that I just call them experiments, these tricks that you do?
*  I love that word.
*  And here we agree that we're going to talk about science today, as we always do whenever I see you.
*  And in experiments, as people may or may not know, you ask a question, but you pose hypotheses.
*  So you say, like, how do we cure cancer?
*  But then you pose a hypothesis.
*  You say, I think it's going to be cured by doing blank, blank, and blank.
*  And then you test that and you try and rule out your hypothesis.
*  So it's a little bit of why I call it an experiment.
*  So, for instance, is there a way that you can get people to believe that they saw the numbers?
*  Let's make it very simple.
*  Three, eight and seven, when in fact you held up a piece of paper that said something very different.
*  Is that have you done that before?
*  I see where you're going with this.
*  And I love to use the word experiments.
*  One of my heroes, Chan Kanasta, was a psychologist who used psychology in his work as a magician,
*  as a mentalist, and he never called his pieces tricks or magic.
*  He called them experiments.
*  And he was careful about it.
*  It's not just an aesthetic choice.
*  He wanted to plant this seed in their mind.
*  Experiment means it could fail, which is a very good starting point for any dramatic...
*  Because if something is going to work, but if there's something at stake, something could fail,
*  people are more engaged.
*  So I love the word.
*  I sometimes use the word experiment.
*  Yeah, it's like these crazy people that climb up the side of buildings with no ropes.
*  I mean, we don't want to see them fall, but the possibility that they could fall is what's exciting.
*  The movie Free Solo, with Alex Honnell, we all know at the beginning he lives.
*  He lives, and yet you want to see it in case he might not live.
*  And even though you know he lives, in some ways that's a magic trick unto itself.
*  That's the brilliance of David Blaine, who I consider one of my dearest friends
*  and one of my favorite magicians in the world.
*  And what he does, I mean, we can talk about him at length, but, you know,
*  blending real stuff with magic, and it's almost...
*  Sometimes it's hard to tell what is real and what's not.
*  And I even love that aspect.
*  And a lot of people don't know, but all the stuff he does is real.
*  When he's holding his breath night after night now in Vegas at the Wynn, ten minutes.
*  And, you know, sitting in the audience watching David do that is so inspiring.
*  Because I look at it symbolically.
*  He's showing us...
*  Because he was inspired by Kato Survived being trapped under ice for a long time
*  and recovered to full recovery.
*  And he goes, if he can do it, then everybody could.
*  And it's a beautiful...
*  To me, the message is so strong.
*  Just beautiful.
*  I'd like to take a brief moment and thank one of our sponsors, and that's AG1.
*  AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that also contains adaptogens.
*  I started taking AG1 way back in 2012.
*  The reason I started taking it and the reason I still take it every day
*  is that it ensures that I meet all of my quotas for vitamins and minerals.
*  And it ensures that I get enough prebiotic and probiotic to support gut health.
*  Now, gut health is something that over the last 10 years,
*  we realized is not just important for the health of our gut,
*  but also for our immune system and for the production of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators,
*  things like dopamine and serotonin.
*  In other words, gut health is critical for proper brain functioning.
*  Now, of course, I strive to consume healthy whole foods
*  for the majority of my nutritional intake every single day.
*  But there are a number of things in AG1,
*  including specific micronutrients that are hard to get from whole foods
*  or at least in sufficient quantities.
*  So AG1 allows me to get the vitamins and minerals that I need,
*  probiotics, prebiotics, the adaptogens and critical micronutrients.
*  So anytime somebody asks me if they were to take just one supplement,
*  what that supplement should be, I tell them AG1,
*  because AG1 supports so many different systems within the body
*  that are involved in mental health, physical health and performance.
*  To try AG1, go to drinkag1.com slash Huberman,
*  and you'll get a year's supply of vitamin D3K2
*  and five free travel packs of AG1.
*  Again, that's drinkag1.com slash Huberman.
*  Orient me again. The question was...
*  Yeah, so the question is, have you done or is it possible to get people
*  to think that you're holding up a piece of paper that says,
*  now I forget the numbers, my working memory wasn't engaged enough to do it,
*  whatever, three, four, eight, that's not what I said earlier,
*  when in fact they are looking at a piece of paper that says something different.
*  Is that something that can be done?
*  Absolutely. Absolutely.
*  There's actually a piece where you have a piece of paper,
*  literally a printed piece of paper, and you control someone's mind,
*  you say, I'm going to make you see things distorted.
*  You're not going to see reality the way everybody in this room,
*  including me, will see it, starting now.
*  And it's literally a piece of paper that says 2 plus 2.
*  And everybody can see it, the entire audience can see it's 2 plus 2.
*  What's the answer? And he goes, 16.
*  OK. And let's try something easier, 1 plus 1.
*  He goes, 24.
*  And this guy is cognitively smart, sharp, he's not on drugs.
*  He cannot answer those questions.
*  It's an augmentation of reality.
*  And that manifests in many forms in magic, the idea of seeing something
*  that is in a sort, you know, in the optical illusion land of what you see
*  is not what you see.
*  And that's probably applicable to every trick you'll ever see.
*  What you see is not what you see.
*  It's what I want you to see.
*  And I love that.
*  And again, the Chancanast that the guy spoke to you about,
*  he would go and he would take three cards, let's say,
*  Ace of Hearts, King of Clubs, Seven of Spades, three cards.
*  He'll go to a coffee shop and say, choose one.
*  And they say, King of Clubs. Thank you.
*  Go to another table. And he will do it all night.
*  And people, what is he doing? He's not doing any magic, nothing.
*  He's just surveying the audience to see how they think, right?
*  And this is information that we collect over the years.
*  Like there's something called, I can influence you,
*  let's say, to take a specific card.
*  But it has to be done in such a way that it feels like it was a free choice.
*  It was not a free choice.
*  And the difference between a good or a great magician
*  and a decent magician or an OK magician
*  is that one makes you feel like, I chose this card.
*  There is no way you made me pick this card.
*  There is no way.
*  And that's a sort of augmentation.
*  You feel like you have control, and yet you don't.
*  And you feel it with conviction.
*  You could swear, that's the one.
*  So there's a famous, famous thing that he used to do.
*  He would say, I can make people change their mind or not.
*  And he says it upfront.
*  He says, you're going to choose a card, any card you like.
*  I'll go to the audience.
*  You point to any person you want.
*  They'll choose another card.
*  Whatever they choose will be the card you're thinking of.
*  And then I'll give them 10 seconds to change their mind.
*  And if they do, it will still be correct.
*  They can change their mind as many times as they want.
*  And I don't care.
*  Once they say, that's it.
*  That's the card.
*  That will be the card you're thinking of.
*  How can that be?
*  So the truth is, and I'll reveal a little bit about that,
*  there is no trickery here as far as sleight of hand or anything like that.
*  He literally was a master at making people either want to stick to a decision or change it.
*  He would basically manipulate their insecurity, their ego, something about them to either
*  resist changing or to really want to change.
*  And to me, and I have a conflict, a dilemma about this, because my whole foolish act,
*  which if you want, we can talk about, is really based on this conflict or this problem I have.
*  Sometimes the method is way more beautiful than the effect itself.
*  So that's why I have no problem telling that Chen did that.
*  Chen found a way with using specific language or gestures or whatnot,
*  without revealing too much, to make somebody either stick to their choice or change their mind.
*  He could literally control their bias toward one or the other.
*  Yes.
*  Does it involve touching their body in any particular way?
*  Maybe.
*  Maybe.
*  Yeah.
*  Many times in your performances and the performances of other mentalists and magicians,
*  they will say, you know, pick a number, pick a card, and then right before the trick is about to advance,
*  they'll say, are you sure?
*  Okay.
*  Oh, that's a big one.
*  And they'll say, yes, I'm sure, or no, I'm going to switch.
*  Okay.
*  And based on what you've told us already, it's clear that the skilled mentalist or magician
*  can work with either scenario.
*  Maybe it's a bit of a, it's the improvisation.
*  But what I want to know is when you look at somebody's physical body, how they sit, their shape,
*  and other features, maybe how they dress, how they stand, maybe something about their eyes or their face,
*  can you make better predictions as to what sorts of numbers they'll pick,
*  whether or not they're going to stick to their choice or change their choice?
*  Absolutely.
*  Okay.
*  I think there's a lot of interest in this.
*  And maybe you could, since we're talking in generic terms,
*  and we're not presenting you with a line of people and asking you which person would do what,
*  would you be willing to share what some of those cues are?
*  So I'm, you know, me, I wear this black shirt and I have other shirts, but I don't wear them on camera.
*  And, you know, I comb my hair a certain way.
*  I sit a certain way.
*  I mean, what sorts of predictions emerge from that?
*  Or am I striking on the wrong variables?
*  So it's not the big things that will reveal to me what,
*  because I do kind of like profile a little bit for the magic purposes,
*  what kind of trick I will do with you and what I can't do with you, what I will do with this guy or that guy, right?
*  And it's not the shirt.
*  It's not how you wear your hair.
*  It's really small things.
*  And I can talk about many people that influence me.
*  Avner Dixentrik is one of my favorite performers.
*  His name is literally The Eccentric.
*  It's a different name, but he goes by Avner Dixentrik.
*  And he's a wonderful performer.
*  It's even hard to categorize what he does, but he's...
*  I'm doing this service, a clown, a mime, a juggler, a magician.
*  And I've never seen someone who's better at what we call audience management.
*  But something we call audience management is how do you interact with people?
*  And he's able to get...
*  Again, I'm butchering his class to something very simple, but he gets three yeses from a person,
*  meaning I can ask you, non-verbally, to agree to participate with something I want you to do.
*  And he will do small things, like just a little gesture, and he can see if they go for it.
*  He sees if there's that dance.
*  Can we...
*  Is that person complying to something very small, or is he resisting?
*  And then easily I can go to the next person.
*  And he's a master, a master at doing that.
*  Even breathing.
*  If I breathe a certain way, this blew my mind when I first learned from Avner.
*  It's like when you walk into a place, so you don't see me, I'm behind a curtain,
*  I do something, and I walk in, and the first thing I do is...
*  Or as opposed to...
*  Do I take the breath in or out when I...
*  The first step I take on stage.
*  And the audience, in a weird way, mimics that.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  So if I go...
*  You feel...
*  You kind of tend to relax with me.
*  Now, if you want a more exaggerated example of that,
*  if you watch a movie and it's really tense and there's tension,
*  you will start feeling tension, right?
*  We're kind of like...
*  Empathy is a big, big part of what we do.
*  That's why one of the things I choose to do in my show when I first start
*  is not to start with the most amazing magic, to blow your mind,
*  oh my God, he's amazing.
*  It's more...
*  I gear the first pieces towards connecting with you.
*  I'd rather say something really endearing, funny, connecting, truthful, honest,
*  before I start trying to blow your mind.
*  Why?
*  I want to connect with you first, so we...
*  You know, a mother will be proud of her son's playing guitar,
*  and much more forgiving if he makes a little mistake or something,
*  but every little achievement he will make, she will be so proud of him,
*  because she has empathy.
*  She wants him to succeed.
*  She wants him to do well.
*  So I want you to adopt me.
*  I want you to feel empathy towards me.
*  I want you to be... I'm rooting for you.
*  This makes a lot of sense.
*  I do some live events and I don't think about whether or not I exhale or inhale
*  when I get out there, but I definitely try and get out there
*  and just kind of take it all in and relax,
*  and we have what I hope is a relaxing, interesting conversation,
*  and you kind of work with the amplitude of excitement,
*  and I'm not thinking about it in any kind of conscious way,
*  but this is actually a wonderful tool that I hope everyone will export
*  from this conversation, which is if you ever need to do public speaking...
*  Breathe.
*  ...have probably a good long exhale as you get out there will be great.
*  Everyone will relax.
*  It's also tough for me to see live theatre,
*  because oftentimes if it's not going well for them,
*  I feel embarrassed for them.
*  I think people vary, however, in terms of their levels of empathic attunement.
*  Some people are very tuned into the emotional states of others,
*  and some are not.
*  So are there people in audiences,
*  assuming a relatively random array of people,
*  that are fairly rigid, like you wouldn't want to...
*  You wouldn't call them up to the table.
*  Absolutely.
*  OK. So when you select someone to come up in front of the crowd,
*  are you basing that on some level of empathic attunement,
*  that they're in sync with you?
*  Absolutely. So it starts with...
*  The first thing... Look, you come in cold.
*  The audience, as you said, the first... I'm quoting Avner here.
*  The first thing they do is they say, I hope this doesn't suck.
*  And also the performer says, I hope it's not going to suck.
*  The starting point is... It depends.
*  Expectation could vary, you know, if somebody is really hyped and go,
*  oh, this is going to be great, or you've seen the artist and you trust them.
*  But if you come in cold, you don't know the person.
*  You don't know if it's going to be great or not.
*  You just happen to be there and there's a magic show.
*  Let's check it out.
*  There's tension.
*  There's almost like they're auditioning you.
*  I wonder if it's going to be worth my time.
*  So... And I don't care if people bought a ticket to see my off-Broadway show or not.
*  The first 10, 15 minutes, it's really about telling them in so many...
*  You know, without words, but telling them, I'm here for you.
*  I'm here to connect with you.
*  And I'm here to create this...
*  Some wonderful thing that we're going to feel together.
*  I want them to feel that.
*  It's like an intimacy.
*  Yes. And that, to me, by the way, is way more important than me fooling people.
*  Like, if somebody came to me after the show and said,
*  oh, wow, your magic is unbelievable.
*  I have no idea how you did it.
*  That's the lowest compliment I can get.
*  And thankfully and gratefully,
*  often I get the most common one is, you know, the magic was great, but...
*  You... We like you.
*  They feel connected to you.
*  And I love that because to me, the magic is important.
*  I want it to be really deceptive.
*  I want it to be, you know, impossible and beautiful and whatnot.
*  But to me, it's also a vehicle to connect with people,
*  because at the end of the day, that's what it is.
*  And that's the only difference I can have, because there's a lot of magicians.
*  A lot of people can do magic that you can't figure out.
*  That's the lowest bar.
*  You fool me, good magician.
*  Make me feel magic higher and maybe feel magic and connect.
*  It's like if somebody cannot even explain what I did in my show and goes,
*  you had to be there.
*  That's something Steve Martin says all the time.
*  You had to be there.
*  I can tell you with words what it's like to see his show.
*  You have to see it in person.
*  That to me is a very high goal of...
*  Like, I want him to remember the experience and the feeling rather than particularly...
*  I want him to care about what he experienced emotionally.
*  And that's how I recall the trick that you did outside.
*  The person who initially connected us, just absolutely terrific.
*  What I call close contact card magician, Franco Pascali.
*  Here in Los Angeles.
*  He has amazing card skills.
*  He does something with his card tricks.
*  I noticed...
*  I'll go to the Magic Castle as often as possible.
*  And I just watch and like to take this in and try and think about the neuroscience behind it,
*  as you can tell.
*  And when he lands a trick, meaning when the person takes the card and says,
*  oh my goodness, how did you know?
*  Or it's like the ace switches the card, whatever it is.
*  Franco also acts surprised.
*  He joins you as an audience member momentarily.
*  He goes, oh!
*  And then he goes back to being the magician.
*  And I find that especially important for people to understand because you do the same.
*  And I always say, having studied the lectures of many, many spectacular scientists and lectures,
*  that the best lecturers in the classroom obviously are teaching the material from a place of deep understanding of the material,
*  one would hope, right?
*  So they have mastery of the material, in some cases virtuosity with the material.
*  But as they're presenting the material to people who know nothing about it,
*  they themselves are showing their delight in the material as if it's the first time they've ever seen it.
*  And so they are both student and teacher at the same time, and you feel immense resonance with them.
*  It's nice.
*  And it reminds me of the experience of seeing you do magic or mentalist work.
*  Sure.
*  I'm yet to see you go, oh my goodness.
*  But I think it's the sense that you're collaborating in something and there's this giving over of self.
*  Like, I trust Asi to take me someplace with this.
*  So the resistant people, the people that sort of like, I'm not going to let him fool me.
*  Right.
*  What's so amazing is that in your shows, oftentimes those people are the ones that are the ones walking out just shaking their heads.
*  I know because I've brought some of them along to your shows going, there's no way.
*  There's no way.
*  And yet you got them.
*  So do the resistant people serve a role even if they're not called up?
*  Of course.
*  Yeah.
*  What role do skeptics play in convincing other people that something happened that didn't really happen?
*  So first of all, the transformation.
*  Somebody is a believer and you show magic and nice.
*  It's wonderful.
*  We can celebrate magic together.
*  But somebody is a skeptic, really skeptical.
*  And I've had really.
*  And I sensed that I could convert them.
*  I could transform them.
*  And the audience watches this transformation.
*  So we're going from here to here.
*  That's a wonderful thing.
*  So every now and then I will recognize the person who's like, and you slowly start to see melt and softens.
*  It's almost like a musician at a wedding.
*  You know, the people that jump up and dance immediately.
*  But if you're a skilled musician, you get that person that, you know, their their wife is saying, come on, let's dance and won't move.
*  And then maybe you hit a certain motif in the music and the person taps their foot a little bit, moves their head.
*  And then there are certain people that they won't dance at all unless their song comes up and then they like dart to the dance floor.
*  Sounds a little bit like that.
*  And you've captured them.
*  You've captured their emotion.
*  You've captured their willingness.
*  You've captured their whole body willingness to participate in something that a minute before they were either too embarrassed, too stubborn or too tired to engage in.
*  So here's the deal.
*  Magic could be and often is intimidating.
*  I am basically challenging your intellect.
*  I and some people, if they take it the wrong way, they what they hear is you telling me that you're smarter than me.
*  You're telling me, you know, things I don't know, and I'm not even close to knowing.
*  So screw you.
*  And they will reject it aggressively.
*  Like I've had, thankfully, it's a percent a time when we do walk around magic and I go and some people, as soon as they see me, no, no, no, no thanks.
*  They don't want to see it.
*  And to me, that drove me nuts.
*  Why don't they want to they don't even know what I'm about to offer.
*  You're going to violate their sense of self-trust.
*  That's, I think, the fear.
*  Absolutely.
*  And as a magician or as an artist, if I if I use that, but my goal is to also educate them as I do the magic that we're creating this safe space where these things could happen.
*  And it's clear that I'm using it for your own good.
*  I you know, I did a whole fullest act exactly about knowing and not knowing.
*  So I I'm not going to spoil too much if people want to see it.
*  They can see it.
*  I'll tell you a backstory on this if you don't mind.
*  So Tommy, the three major heroes of magic are Juan Tamarith, Tommy Wander and Chan Canasta.
*  Are they alive still?
*  Chan is not and Tommy passed.
*  Juan is still kicking butt in Madrid.
*  I think I saw him at the castle.
*  He's very exuberant.
*  Yeah. OK.
*  So he's a hero and I'm his student.
*  So but let's talk about Tommy for a sec.
*  So Tommy, for a long time, he he did magic that magicians do not know how it works.
*  It was so devious that even magicians did not know how it works.
*  And at some point, he released some DVDs that teach his magic.
*  And the trick is very simple.
*  He borrows someone's watch.
*  It disappears.
*  And there's a table right next to him with a little box and a ribbon.
*  And he literally grabs the ribbon.
*  So he never touches the box, lifts the box, gives it to somebody.
*  He opens it inside.
*  There's an alarm clock.
*  They unscrew the alarm clock and inside is their watch.
*  No, I mean, yes.
*  Yes.
*  But even magicians who saw that, they go, I have no idea how it's done.
*  No idea.
*  And then I remember watching the explanation for the first time.
*  And I was thinking that the method was by far more interesting, intriguing,
*  revealing, just beautiful.
*  It made the trick less like I said, you should perform the explanation.
*  Don't perform the trick.
*  Perform the explanation.
*  And I broke the rules of magic.
*  My non-magician friends will come over and say, let me share something.
*  And I show them the trick and they go, wow, that's amazing.
*  Let me show the explanation.
*  And their mind was blown.
*  Are you willing to share a little bit of what the explanation is or is that not?
*  No.
*  But I will explain a little bit.
*  So I tell them what the explanation was that he revealed that he's an engineer,
*  that he can build props that are ingenious.
*  Again, I'm going around it.
*  But at some point, the person who opens the box is doing part of the trick and he
*  doesn't know it.
*  He's creating the trick, but he doesn't know he's contributing something to it.
*  And it's just beautiful.
*  Metaphorically, symbolically, it hits so many levels at least.
*  And that planted a seed in my mind.
*  I want to create an effect that the method is prettier than the trick itself.
*  So I worked for five years to create an explanation, a pseudo explanation to a trick.
*  That was just beautiful.
*  And it was an opportunity to...
*  Have you seen it?
*  This is the one you did for Penn and Teller.
*  Yeah.
*  You can describe it or I can describe it.
*  Sure.
*  Let's see how you remember it.
*  You're right.
*  I have more interest in listening than speaking.
*  But I'll tell you how I remember it.
*  OK.
*  You're in front of a very large audience that includes the scientist slash show guys at
*  Penn and Teller who basically debunk stuff.
*  They're kind of...
*  They try to figure it out.
*  They try and figure stuff out.
*  They are asked to pick someone in the audience.
*  They pick a guy, as I recall, you wore a green and white sweater.
*  Wow.
*  You have a good memory.
*  Yeah.
*  He stands up and you ask him to pick a card.
*  I forget what it is.
*  Jack of clubs, perhaps.
*  Let's just say for sake of example, Jack of clubs, you said, are you sure you're now on
*  stage?
*  Mind you, there are hundreds of people in the audience, maybe more.
*  And you say, are you sure?
*  And he goes, yeah.
*  And then he goes, are you very sure?
*  And he said, no, I'm going to switch.
*  First of all, you have a good memory.
*  Perhaps.
*  I've been accused of...
*  I have a little bit of an audiographic memory for certain things, but not a visual memory
*  that's perfect.
*  They're sort of adjacent.
*  We could talk about that sometime.
*  It's something that helps you if you need to learn neuroanatomy.
*  That's about it.
*  Can be cultivated.
*  OK, so then he switches the card.
*  Let's just call it, I don't know, Jack of spades, right?
*  OK.
*  Or King of spades, let's say Jack of spades.
*  And then next to you on the table, on the stage, is a table, a round table with a plexiglass
*  box, cigar box.
*  Cigar box.
*  It's clear.
*  No, no, not yet.
*  No?
*  Later.
*  Later.
*  OK.
*  First, it's just a wooden cigar box.
*  A wooden box, that's right.
*  And a mug, a white mug, not unlike the mug I have here, except white.
*  You take a sip from that mug.
*  And then at some point during this exchange, and then you open the box and you pull from
*  the box, of course, the card that he selected.
*  And everyone goes, oh my goodness, how could that possibly be?
*  Because obviously anyone could have been selected in the audience, he switched his choice, etc.
*  But then you reveal how the trick is done, or at least seemingly reveal it, which is
*  that beneath the box there are a bunch of different decks of cards.
*  52.
*  52 on a turnstile.
*  So within each one, right, and I missed a piece of it.
*  You pull out the whole deck and only one card is turned over.
*  And all the other cards are blank.
*  All the other cards are blank, right.
*  So there's more to it.
*  So then it turns out that there are 52 different decks underneath the table, and it's on a
*  turnstile, so you can actually dial it in.
*  And let's keep the ending surprise.
*  Right.
*  So there's a surprise ending to it.
*  Right.
*  So then it at least seemingly makes sense as to how Ossie did this.
*  He has all the different possible options available to him physically, but the audience
*  doesn't realize that.
*  Also, the mug, by the way, engages a magnet system that allows him to dial the deck of
*  cards to the correct one that allows him to match the choice.
*  So it truly could be any card in the deck.
*  Good memory.
*  Meaning it's all, so the straightforward explanation is it's all physical trickery by way of props.
*  Correct.
*  So here's the deal.
*  What I tried to achieve with this piece is first to make people feel magic.
*  So the trick, it's a good trick.
*  You know, name any card.
*  The card he named was reversed, and then it was the only blue card in the deck.
*  And then all the other cards were blank.
*  So it's clearly the only card he could have named.
*  And he did switches, which is an amazing detail that you remembered.
*  He did switch from the King of Clubs to the King of Spades or something like that.
*  Now, so people felt what it's like to see a good card trick.
*  All right.
*  And then I wanted him to feel what it's like to know.
*  And the lesson here is, you know, you could satisfy your curiosity.
*  Oh, that's how it's done.
*  And you can go on with your life and that's it.
*  And that's what happens to a magician when you first learn the secrets to, you know,
*  something that fooled you.
*  There's disappointment.
*  I remember the first trick that was revealed to me.
*  It was a little red handkerchief stuffed into the hand.
*  Gone.
*  And I'm like, what?
*  Do it again.
*  And he did it again.
*  He did 10 times in a row.
*  I could.
*  And then he explained to me how it's done.
*  And the secret was so simple and stupid.
*  No.
*  Can that you share with us?
*  No.
*  No.
*  No, but I got to it was primitive.
*  It was simple.
*  And in the moment he revealed the gimmick that caused the handkerchief to disappear,
*  I could not see the trick again.
*  Every time it is, it's this.
*  It's like falling out of love.
*  Something like that.
*  Really?
*  I mean, a previous guest on the podcast, Carl Deisseroth, one of the best bioengineers,
*  neuroscientists, and psychiatrists in the world, went on Lex Friedman podcast and they
*  were talking about love.
*  And Carl said something interesting that's very relevant here.
*  He said, he's a colleague of mine at Stanford, very poetic guy.
*  He said, love between two people, romantic love that is, is one of the few things in
*  life that we collaborate with someone to story something into the future.
*  This is different than the love of a child or a sibling or a parent or a pet, et cetera,
*  or a friend.
*  You're creating a story that's based on real experience of past and present, but there's
*  this storying forward of love.
*  That's great.
*  And falling out of love involves, of course, the ending of the story moving forward, but
*  also in some cases, sadly, a revision of the events of the past.
*  I like, it's great.
*  It's very close.
*  It's very close to the feeling you have as a magician the first time you get exposed,
*  right?
*  It disappoints you because you have a desire for it to be real.
*  The desire of a young magician is when I see something like that is that it's a supernatural
*  power.
*  And the first thing you understand is that it's not supernatural, that it's quite simple
*  and primitive.
*  And it fooled you because of all the psychology and the desire, like everything we spoke about,
*  my desire to see magic, the effect of the idea of misdirection, which we can talk about
*  at length.
*  Misdirection means I provide something very interesting for you to follow.
*  And you will follow that path because it's the most interesting at the moment to follow.
*  And in the background, in the shadiness of life, some dirty stuff happens.
*  But you don't pay attention because I don't feature it.
*  It's not important.
*  And I make you render it as not important.
*  So it does that, right?
*  And it's disappointment.
*  But there's good news.
*  If you keep up with magic and you start to understand that to do a trick, the secret,
*  the actual how you did it is 1% of the whole procedure.
*  And there's much more to doing that trick effectively, which is storytelling, connecting,
*  doing it in such a way that somebody cares about it.
*  And that is a lifetime of pondering and contemplation.
*  So you have, maybe you'll find an analogy with love again.
*  I don't know.
*  There's also this time when you start appreciating it again, appreciate the secret again, because
*  you understand the nuance.
*  You understand the complexity of this simple thing.
*  And that's what happened to me.
*  So in some magic, which is the exception, is the table that we spoke about that I did
*  on Fulas or Tommy Wander's table, where the effect is so, so, so magnificent that you
*  do appreciate it immediately.
*  But those are rare.
*  This magic is simple, dirty, and to the point.
*  But it achieves something that looks very complex.
*  Perhaps now would be the appropriate time for you to reveal the non-reveal of the explanation
*  of the trick.
*  Because one of the amazing things about the trick that you did with selecting the card
*  the gentleman in the audience of Penn and Teller had mentally and verbally selected
*  is that at the very end, after everyone believes they now understand how the trick is done,
*  the turnstile table, the magnet, the coffee mug, you proceed to strip away the curtain
*  around the table and pull out a piece of paper, not 52 decks of cards.
*  It's a picture of 52.
*  It's a picture, which means that the explanation that they got, while entirely plausible, if
*  that's actually what had happened is not at all what had happened.
*  In other words, you pop out at the end that they don't actually know how it's done.
*  You know how it's done.
*  And I'm not even going to bother to ask you how it's done, because you're not going to
*  reveal it.
*  In other words, people were misdirected into thinking they understood the trick.
*  And therefore, kind of, there's a bit of a letdown.
*  It's interesting, but it's just mechanics.
*  And then you reveal that their understanding is actually not real.
*  Yes.
*  And the reason I wanted to go there, I wanted them to feel magic, then to feel what it's
*  like to know something, and the fact that it's irreversible.
*  You can't unknow a trick once you know how it's done.
*  And then what I said, look, I made a choice.
*  I chose to learn the secrets to magic, and I'm paying a price for it.
*  I cannot see magic the way you can.
*  I cannot enjoy it the way my audience can.
*  And in a weird way, I'm experiencing magic only through their eyes.
*  When I see someone goes, wow, through you, I can experience it.
*  But that's it.
*  I cannot firsthand experience magic the way you can.
*  So I said, I'm not here to make that choice for you.
*  So let me bring you back to safety, to the place you were at.
*  It's a place I envy.
*  To mystery.
*  And then I revealed that the whole explanation was bogus.
*  The whole thing was just another lie.
*  And I'm establishing another thing that as a magician, I have a license to lie to you.
*  And it's okay, because that's my job.
*  And therefore, it makes it honest.
*  And we're collaborating in that to some extent, because when people go to a magic show, they
*  understand that.
*  Another former guest on the podcast, Rick Rubin, who needs no introduction, but by the
*  way, he's a big fan of magic, has said to me before that there are only two things in
*  life that are absolutely true.
*  One is nature.
*  They're real truths.
*  They're real laws and rules of nature.
*  And the other is for him, professional wrestling, because Rick loves professional wrestling.
*  He's a lifetime member of the AEW and the WWE.
*  I've gone to see wrestling with him.
*  And the reason he believes it's one of the few things that's real is that everyone knows
*  it's not real.
*  And so everyone agrees to collaborate in this story, this theater of these guys hate each
*  other.
*  This woman and this woman are now friends.
*  They are collaborators.
*  And so unlike everything else, which is completely made up, and you're not sure what's real and
*  what's fake with professional wrestling and with nature, it's a real truth.
*  I would add to that magic, because when we go to see magic, we want to be astonished.
*  Most people do.
*  We want our perceptions to be violated, right?
*  What we believe is there is in there, et cetera.
*  And yet we are doing this consensually.
*  We're doing this.
*  And so we're agreeing, like, let's collaborate in a lie that there's this thing called magic.
*  I guess, and that's a pretty ill-defined term in its own right, where this idea that physical
*  objects can be made to disappear, violate the rules of nature, of physics.
*  Unless you're of a certain ilk out there in the world, that simply is not the case.
*  The laws of nature hold.
*  Maybe there's another analogy there, because we know that professional wrestlers are faking
*  it.
*  And we know a magician fakes it, too.
*  He fakes supernatural powers.
*  They're doing real things in wrestling, but they're not actually trying to harm one another.
*  Correct.
*  Right.
*  They're collaborating.
*  But it's almost a care-graphed fight, right?
*  Yes.
*  My understanding is, based on discussions with Rick and professional wrestlers that Rick
*  has introduced me to, is that there's some room for improvisation.
*  And occasionally people will hurt one another accidentally.
*  Sometimes there are real conflicts that are created.
*  Just like in the theater, people will have relationships offstage, et cetera, and it
*  creates conflict onstage.
*  And that's where the theater of life meets the theater of the stage and vice versa.
*  So I would add to that.
*  Maybe.
*  Maybe I'm wrong.
*  You do a magic show, and an educated person, a smart person who knows that what I do is
*  trickery, conjuring.
*  But every now and then they might ask, I wonder if that was real.
*  That little part he just did, maybe that was real.
*  So there's a moment, I think, in magic where even the smartest guy who knows I do tricks
*  ago, yeah, this is all tricks, but maybe what he just did now, maybe that was real.
*  Like when you say real, you mean...
*  Real magic.
*  ...violates the rules of physics.
*  So taking a card, holding it up, clenching your fist, making it disappear.
*  I'm giving simple, silly examples.
*  Or mind reading.
*  Or they say maybe he's able to do those things psychologically or whatnot, right?
*  And maybe that happens also in wrestling.
*  They say, yeah, it's fake, but I think that moment was real.
*  So there's an inkling or moments where...
*  Because I think to create this drama, and to me that exists in magic, easy real, easy
*  fake.
*  Did I figure it out or did I not figure it out?
*  Am I close or am I not?
*  There's constant conflict in a magic show that you go in and out of.
*  And I wonder if that happens in wrestling as well, where you know it's fake, but maybe
*  there's something that was real, or this happened and that was not planned.
*  So I think that this...
*  Just the thinking, the fact that you invest it into thinking what is real and what is
*  not is intriguing.
*  I'd like to just take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors, InsideTracker.
*  InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood
*  and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals.
*  Now I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that
*  many of the factors that impact our immediate and long-term health can only be addressed.
*  That is, can only be measured with a quality blood test.
*  Now one issue with many blood tests out there is that you get information back about lipid
*  levels, hormone levels, metabolic factors, et cetera, but you don't know what to do with
*  that information.
*  With InsideTracker, they make it very easy to understand your levels and what they mean
*  and specific actionable items that you can undertake in order to bring those levels into
*  the ranges that are optimal for you.
*  InsideTracker also offers InsideTracker Pro, which enables coaches and health professionals
*  to provide premium and personalized services by leveraging InsideTracker's analysis and
*  recommendations with their clients.
*  If you'd like to try InsideTracker, you can go to insidetracker.com slash Huberman and
*  you'll get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans.
*  Again, that's insidetracker.com slash Huberman.
*  I think there's a much larger theme here that we're veering toward and I'm getting excited
*  because this has to do with how the brain works and there are examples in different
*  domains but two come to mind now.
*  Rick and I sometimes hang out here in Los Angeles and there's a place where we do sauna
*  and cold that looks out on the ocean.
*  Rick once turned to me and said, isn't it interesting?
*  We know that there are all these animals under the water, dolphins and whales and all this
*  stuff, sharks.
*  When we see a dolphin or a group of dolphins or we see a whale breach, it's like people
*  are just delighted.
*  Now they're beautiful animals but oftentimes it's just a tail slapping the top and I think
*  and he said, I wonder if it's because it reminds us of how much is going on there underneath
*  the surface.
*  I love that because I think A, he's right.
*  I've done some snorkeling, some scuba diving.
*  You see lots of stuff and it's a brilliant experience to see all that and to be a fish
*  of sorts and be breathing underwater but there is something magnificent about seeing an aquatic
*  animal breach the surface and it goes beyond just seeing the animal.
*  It's like a reminder of all these other things that are likely happening that are outside
*  our usual perception and so that's what comes to mind there.
*  Then I had another example but I can't think of it now where, oh, it's in sports.
*  I always think of there's unskilled, skilled mastery and virtuosity and virtuosity in music
*  like yo-yo ma or in sport, I don't know, pick up, I don't know, Michael Jordan, whatever
*  favorite sport.
*  This idea that maybe they don't even know what they're going to do next, that there's
*  some improvisation at the level of extreme mastery where you're going to see something
*  you've never seen before and I think that's what delights people.
*  It's not just about getting the ball into the end zone or the ball into the basket or
*  playing a piece of music.
*  It's the idea of something happening for the first time and maybe again as with the earlier
*  example that the person performing, the athlete, the musician, et cetera, the magician, the
*  mentalist, they themselves are delighted by what just happened.
*  They didn't even realize it was going to happen and you collaborate in this like, wow, life
*  holds far more than I experience in my daily perceptual kind of framework.
*  Yeah, could very well could be.
*  I think your shows bring people to that.
*  I want to return to a couple of ideas.
*  First of all, we've been talking about emotion and collaboration a lot.
*  We've had a guest on the podcast, David Spiegel.
*  He's our associate chair of psychiatry at Stanford who does clinical hypnosis which
*  brings people into a state of calm plus a very constrained context where they're more
*  likely to think about certain things than others.
*  How much of what you do with an individual or group of people in your craft involves
*  hypnosis, constraining the context?
*  In other words, eliminating certain patterns of thinking to make other certain patterns
*  of thinking more likely.
*  Is that like a storytelling?
*  Like you start telling me a story, a horror story or a mystery or a comedy story.
*  I'm shutting down whatever you're not talking about.
*  Is that something that you do?
*  Yeah.
*  So first of all, we have theatrical hypnosis.
*  People that do shows where they gather about 20 people on stage and they start making them
*  dance like chickens.
*  I've never been full on with this type of performances for various reasons.
*  To me, that's not the best way for me to engage with an audience or to manipulate them.
*  However, there's certain things that we do in magic that if you say certain things in
*  a certain way, it will produce a certain answer.
*  It amazes me too.
*  We call them psychological forces.
*  You say a string of words in a certain order and it will produce with high percentage a
*  yes or a no or I want this and not that.
*  Like would you want to pick this deck of cards or that deck of cards type leading?
*  That could be the simplest of the idea, but it could be even more complex than that.
*  It amazes me because it's almost like a recipe.
*  You follow the recipe, put it in the oven, boom, okay.
*  In magic, when I search certain things, there's a moment when I'm waiting for you to say something
*  and I don't know if you're going to follow what I just did.
*  Then I hear it and I go, there's a joy.
*  I was like, yes, it worked.
*  This reveals something fundamental about the brain.
*  I could imagine if I have two mugs in front of me for those listening, if I hover my finger
*  on one of them longer than others and I say, would you like to drink from this mug and
*  keep it there for 10 seconds or this one?
*  I just tap the other one briefly.
*  Do you think you bias the probability of which one somebody will pick?
*  Absolutely.
*  Absolutely.
*  That's a great example.
*  It depends on my character.
*  First, I need to know who I'm doing it to.
*  Are you the challenger?
*  Are you the guy who's going to go with anything?
*  Let's say it's the guy who'll go with anything.
*  One thing, there's a likelihood he will go with the one you touch longer, but if it's
*  the challenger, he will say, oh, I see what's happening here.
*  Andrew is trying to make me take this one and therefore I'm going to take that one.
*  That's the simplest idea of challenges.
*  I could challenge you again and say, with doubt.
*  Then I could say, are you sure you want the one that I tapped?
*  Just briefly, I'm not telling you that way, but I'd say, are you sure?
*  If you say, yes, you're challenging me again and now I'm certain you're a challenger.
*  You're collecting data, basically.
*  You're collecting data and because I've done it thousands of times, I do the exact same
*  spell, the same order of events, and I get to try it.
*  Sometimes I say, okay, let's phrase it differently.
*  There's routines where I do and I need someone to say a certain something.
*  I don't just rely on the psychological force.
*  I have other tools in my arsenal of tools.
*  It surprises me the percentage, the rate.
*  That's what John did a lot.
*  He understood the idea that if people feel challenged, they do this.
*  If they feel like maybe that you're desperate for them to change, they'll act a different
*  way.
*  Again, I'm tiptoeing again because I don't want to demystify magic here.
*  I'm trying to say that there's a real way for...
*  Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, they talk about it in their work, the Thinking Fast
*  and Slow, for example, which to us is a magic book.
*  How people make decisions.
*  They often say if you phrase a question one way versus another way, and even though the
*  same thing is at stake, it's the same equation.
*  If you phrase it this way, they'll prefer that.
*  If you phrase it that way, they prefer the other one.
*  It makes no sense.
*  That's the bottom line.
*  Which one do you want?
*  Well, I think the brain runs algorithms.
*  Some of it's historical in how we are raised.
*  I'll give an example.
*  A friend of mine has twins.
*  I said, how's it going with the twins?
*  Describe their personalities and how they differ.
*  He said that one of his twin daughters, no matter what you tell her, she says, no, she
*  challenges you, but not as a way to disengage, as a way to engage.
*  Nice.
*  Interesting.
*  Yeah, interesting.
*  The other one is very willing to engage in things, doesn't challenge, but engages through
*  active collaboration.
*  When we had Chris Voss, a former FBI negotiator here on the podcast, he said one way to get
*  information from people in these scenarios he used to do before is instead of asking
*  them a question, you give a hypothesis.
*  You keep your hair really nice.
*  You got great hair.
*  You must spend a lot of money on clothes.
*  People will respond, he tells me, by either agreeing yes or no.
*  I don't really spend a lot of money.
*  You just got information, but you're not asking, do you spend a lot of money on clothes?
*  You basically state a hypothesis.
*  Then they are either going to accept or refute your hypothesis.
*  People almost reflexively respond to hypotheses about them from others by wanting to defend
*  the truth.
*  That's a way that FBI negotiators and others get information rather than ask questions,
*  give them hypotheses, and people will defend their truth to the point of giving up information
*  they wouldn't otherwise.
*  Yeah.
*  If you want to ... I know you're here for me to reveal my tricks, so I'll reveal something.
*  Hypnosis, they do this quite a bit.
*  It's a beautiful strategy of doing it.
*  They'll make a few statements.
*  They're simple statements.
*  They're accurate.
*  You can argue with those statements.
*  They ring true, and you believe them.
*  Then maybe the last thing they're going to say is not quite true, but because you average
*  the information and you go, okay, he's speaking the truth now.
*  He's telling us the truth.
*  But in between those statements, there's some inaccuracies there that are starting to manipulate
*  you, but they're half-truths.
*  For example, I say this is a round table, and you can feel the light.
*  Even if you close your eyes, you could feel the light, and you can even feel, even if
*  you didn't know, that this is a bigger light than this one because of the heat.
*  Now, this might be a false statement, but it makes sense.
*  And you can start to feel heat on one side.
*  And you start to go, yeah, it's logical.
*  It's very sensical.
*  Therefore, it's true.
*  But it's a half-truth.
*  Maybe if we measure that this is a stronger light, who knows?
*  But and I say, you know, and you feel there's a bit of a hum here, and the more you focus
*  on it, and it's getting louder.
*  Now, because you're paying attention to it, it's getting louder.
*  It's not getting louder, you know, actually.
*  You're guiding perception.
*  But I'm guiding, exactly.
*  I'm directing your attention to the things I want you to.
*  You heard the plane?
*  It's an illusion.
*  No, it's a real plane.
*  But this is something that heaven does do very well, you know?
*  Guiding you, you know, going to NLP and all that, it's all related.
*  The idea of sounding like they're telling you things that should make sense, they're
*  accurate, but they're not.
*  They're sort of accurate.
*  And it becomes more and more ridiculous until they tell you dance like a chicken.
*  And then you dance like a chicken.
*  Yeah, it's so interesting because perception, obviously, is governed by the brain, at least
*  in part brain and body, but nervous system.
*  And we have essentially two attentional spotlights, meaning we can pay attention to two things
*  at the same time, but probably not five.
*  And we can merge those spotlights and we can make them more intense, so to speak, or we
*  can dim them and make them more diffuse.
*  You know, there's a bunch of things that we can do with attentional spotlighting.
*  What you're talking about here is attentional spotlighting, bringing people's perception
*  to real things that are happening, but heightening one's perception of those, so getting more
*  granularity on what's happening.
*  Like right now, I'm in physical contact with a pen in my hand, but I wasn't thinking about
*  how it feels.
*  But if I put all of my perception there, close my eyes and really think about it, the whole
*  nature of the perception changes.
*  The physical object hasn't changed.
*  Nothing else in the room has changed.
*  But that driving of attentional spotlighting and intensity is essentially what governs
*  our whole reality.
*  I think of everything we're talking about here, and I can't help but think about media,
*  social media, politics, you know, very like third rail issues, things that are top, very
*  third rail topics, right?
*  And yet this is essentially what we do.
*  The brain, people want a shorthand way of navigating a very complex world, and media
*  marketing, et cetera, is in large part designed to capture people's attention and then funnel
*  it towards some specific endpoint.
*  Vote this way, buy this way, don't vote that way, or don't vote that way.
*  And I feel like given our discussion, one has to wonder to what extent we are all living
*  in that, what I guess people call it a simulation.
*  It's not a simulation.
*  We are all being biased by these external forces.
*  Do you see examples of quote unquote magic and mentalist work at the level of media,
*  at the level of politics without talking about sides or centers?
*  Of course.
*  Yeah.
*  First of all, I feel like social media has changed the way audience behaves in the theater.
*  Tell me more about that.
*  So first of all, now you have TikTok and Instagram, and it's really short clips of information,
*  and people go through them really quickly.
*  So they need to be stimulated way more often than they used to.
*  So I can't do a routine now that really drags with long monologues and it's slow.
*  The speed changed.
*  And the fact that, and I think about this a lot.
*  I mean, there's a blackout when I did Inner Circle, there's a blackout before I appear.
*  So I come in and I can still see people to the very last minute on their phones and I'm
*  like, wow.
*  It's going from one stimulation to a real stimulation with almost no gap.
*  There's not even a second, a buffer between this stimulation to what I'm doing.
*  And it always bothers me because I want to clean their palate.
*  I want to reset their palate and it bothers me that they're on their phone.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like going from the Super Bowl to the NBA championships or from the ballet to a
*  rock concert.
*  It's like, yeah, I actually have a theory, which is that for those that are willing to
*  introduce gaps in stimulation, sleep, we'll talk more about sleep, rest, walks where we're
*  not looking at our phones or just kind of, not necessarily bored, but that those gaps
*  we know, we know with certainty are when the brain both processes information, stabilizes
*  information that we've learned and comes up with new ideas.
*  It's almost like nowadays, if you want to get really good at some craft, just introduce
*  more gaps in between intense focus and learning around that thing and exposure to that thing.
*  I couldn't be more certain about this.
*  It's true.
*  And again, Juan, again, Tamariz talks about the power of pauses.
*  One of the things we try to do is that people will embed a memory.
*  So it's not just that you encode the information and you want them to store it.
*  You also want to store it long term and to be able to recall what they've seen.
*  Now if you move from one action to the other, it's just not going to work.
*  So there's a thing that Juan does where he's holding a card and he says, can you see the
*  reflection in my glasses?
*  And everyone's like, what is he doing?
*  Look, do you see reflection?
*  And meanwhile, he's holding a playing card to point towards the glasses.
*  And then at some point he places the card on the table and accidentally he knocks a
*  glass filled with water everywhere and people, they start cleaning it.
*  And it's like a huge interruption to what just happened.
*  And then he says, does anybody know what card this is?
*  And most of the times nobody knows.
*  He goes, you never saw this card?
*  And they go, no, you never showed it to us.
*  Oh, I never showed it to you.
*  And there was one event where he did where he replayed the video to them.
*  He says, look, I'm holding it for 15 seconds in front of you in a very awkward way.
*  And they don't remember it.
*  Because something dramatic happened immediately afterwards.
*  There's no moment for them to isolate the two events.
*  And the other event was way more impactful and therefore more memorable that it erased
*  the small memory, the small event.
*  There's a big event and a smaller event and that took over.
*  That's why maybe people crashing to they have an accident, whatever.
*  They don't remember the 10 or five seconds before.
*  It kind of erases it.
*  So we often, when we do magic, we do want to give them a moment to really relax and
*  to digest what they've just seen so they can store it very well.
*  If it's something you want them to store, but if it's something you want them to forget,
*  then creating a dramatic moment adjacent to it and with no gaps is the way to go.
*  We clutter it.
*  We clutter their mind with information when we don't want to store it.
*  We will slow down and feature it and give it enough time to breathe and live when we
*  want them to record it.
*  So the speed, the emphasis, the pauses, all of those things are manipulated in how they
*  remember things.
*  Can I share with you a little bit of neuroscience knowledge?
*  This is relevant both to what you just said and to learning of any kind.
*  There's a phenomenon called gap effects, which are very well demonstrated in neuroscience
*  and psychology of learning.
*  But before I explain those, it's really important to know that when we learn, we are exposed
*  to something and then the actual rewiring of connections in the brain occurs typically
*  during sleep or rest periods away from the learning.
*  There's the stimulus, just like exercise.
*  You don't get better VO2 max and muscle strength, et cetera.
*  During the exercise, there's an adaptation that occurs later.
*  With learning of cognitive material or information of any kind, even if it's very emotionally
*  impactful experience or information, the rewiring of connections occurs later, typically in
*  sleep or sometime later.
*  Now during sleep, the replay of the memory occurs, but at a rate about 20 or 30 times
*  faster and for some reason, nobody knows why in reverse.
*  So a string of numbers, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven in sleep is played 30 times
*  faster and seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.
*  Nobody's knows why.
*  This is the way the brain encodes information about space, about information of any kind.
*  Now gap effects are the very well demonstrated effect of, let's say you're teaching me how
*  to shuffle cards or sequence of numbers or scales on a piano.
*  I'm practicing, I'm practicing, I'm practicing, but somebody figured out that if every once
*  in a while there's a gap introduced where I cannot perform the rehearsal, I do nothing,
*  the brain does the same thing.
*  The hippocampus center in the brain required for memory and encoding of new memories plays
*  that same sequence at 20 to 30 times faster in reverse.
*  So this way.
*  So what this means is that when we introduce gaps, the brain is still processing the information,
*  but much faster and the introduction of the gap somehow allows whatever we just learned
*  to be encoded far more than if we don't introduce a gap, which is exactly what you just said,
*  but with a bunch of nerdy neuroscience speak to it.
*  But this has been shown for music, for math, for conceptual knowledge, et cetera.
*  And what it says to me is that if we want to learn things, controlling the cadence and
*  the availability of gaps and the adjacency, like how densely cluttered or spaced out things
*  are is key.
*  And I'll just share briefly and forgive me because I'm going long here, but the way I
*  remember the video of you with Penn and Teller and the green and white sweater and a few
*  other.
*  You took a nap right after.
*  No, what I do is I watch something or read something and I sometimes highlight and take
*  notes, but then what I do is I close my eyes.
*  Sometimes I take a walk and I just think about what I just saw.
*  Now I have a problem and I was recently referred to as neuro-atypical, which I'm starting to
*  wonder if that's true, but I'll get assessed and we'll see.
*  That oftentimes irrelevant details are what get encoded to memory as opposed to the core
*  feature, but we'll see.
*  I like to think the core components are what I remember, but often details that seem irrelevant
*  get encoded.
*  Like I can remember details of things that are kind of maybe trivial to most.
*  So these gap effects are a real neurobiological phenomenon.
*  There's no question about it.
*  And I suppose I should pause to let that sink in.
*  I know and people should take a nap right after this.
*  Go sleep and think about this conversation.
*  I think it's so interesting because so that explains something about encoding of information,
*  but causing people to forget something is equally important.
*  So oftentimes when you do tricks or when other magicians and mentalists do tricks, I notice
*  that you'll get people to count with you.
*  Okay, let's all right.
*  Let's just count the cards.
*  Count them with me.
*  It'll be one, two, three.
*  Is there something about the counting itself or the cadence of the counting that is valuable?
*  Yes.
*  We try to create tension.
*  You know, it's a drum roll.
*  Think of it as a drum roll all the way to the punch line.
*  And you're trying to create this tension.
*  Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.
*  And then it happens, right?
*  And on the relaxation, the moment right after that when you relax, that's the moment to
*  do the things you don't want them to encode.
*  Those are the most vulnerable.
*  In other words, when you go to a magic show, do not laugh, do not relax, remain tense and
*  you'll be good.
*  But the moment you relax, you're off guard.
*  You're not scrutinizing.
*  You're relaxing.
*  So we do play a lot and Sladini was a master of that, the idea of tension and relaxation.
*  So those are just one of the tools that we would use in order to do what we need to do
*  at the right spot.
*  Look, here's an interesting example.
*  You've heard the term misdirection.
*  I think every person in the world have heard and understands the idea of misdirection.
*  A magician is misdirecting you.
*  And yet, that information does not help you in the real world.
*  Right?
*  You know the concept.
*  You know it exists.
*  You know a magician will make you look at the wrong place at the wrong time and you
*  would, or maybe the right place at the right time, and you would still follow.
*  In other words, knowing the principle, knowing that he's doing it, it's still effective.
*  And that is amazing.
*  So to me, that is the reason I don't mind to enrich people's knowledge about magic
*  and to give a little bit of information behind a curtain.
*  The things that magicians say, oh, we're going to, you know, there's a beautiful saying that
*  I just love and I don't know who's responsible for this beautiful quote, but I love it.
*  I quote it all the time.
*  People think that magicians are guarding the secrets from the audience, but it's the other
*  way around.
*  We are guarding the audience from the secrets.
*  So because we know that once you know how it's done, you won't enjoy it.
*  But I believe also that there's a level of knowledge that you can know about magic that
*  next time you see a magician, you will enjoy it more.
*  Because you understand that to do one card trick could take months and months of work.
*  And we think about every word and every move and how we interact and how we, you know,
*  hook you into wanting to be fooled, create the desire for you to see magic.
*  And it's such an intricate process.
*  So maybe, you know, revealing a little bit about magic is not a bad thing.
*  So you understand the complexity of this art, which unfortunately is invisible art.
*  Because a pianist, sure, you can see how skillful I am.
*  But if you come to me after shows, oh, you're so fast with your hands.
*  That's an insult.
*  I want you to say, but you never touched anything.
*  So it's a bit of a conflict here.
*  It's like the show that I saw that you did in New York right off Washington Square Park.
*  You didn't touch any of the cards or materials.
*  The audience did it all for you, which are the inner circle.
*  You had people actually maneuvering the cards and doing things.
*  They weren't collaborating with you.
*  In fact, it made it far less likely that you ought to be able to do what you were doing,
*  which is remarkable.
*  I think that, you know, as you're describing this, I can't help but feel that the understanding
*  of mechanism or how it's done just a little bit is a little bit of what I've tried to
*  do with the podcast, where I think people obviously want to know what to do for their
*  health.
*  But if they understand a little bit of the mechanism behind it, maybe a lot of the mechanism
*  in some cases, then I think it enriches their understanding and gives them flexibility when
*  things are perhaps not optimal.
*  Sort of like someone learning a recipe versus understanding why you add a little bit of
*  baking soda so that when there isn't any baking soda, maybe there's an alternative or you
*  make an adjustment someplace else.
*  That's what a real cook can do as opposed to somebody just following a recipe.
*  I think that with magic, this takes us back to the first question.
*  I think with magic, it's so exciting to me that the magician, the mentalist themselves
*  might not get it right.
*  Like if I know you're going to get it right, it's exciting because if I bring someone else
*  along that's never seen it before.
*  But what I want to know is that, you know, the trapeze artists could fall.
*  Exactly.
*  I don't want them to fall, but the idea that they could fall is what makes it really exciting.
*  Absolutely.
*  And we fake it a lot.
*  There's a lot of times where I will intentionally create a scenario where it seems like it's
*  not going right.
*  You know, I'm in trouble and I need to get out of it and you go, oh, he's okay.
*  He's good, good, but this one, no.
*  And then you realize, oh, it was a part of the illusion.
*  And this is like every-
*  Even the trouble was an illusion.
*  I don't trust anything.
*  Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt there.
*  You paused for me to remember.
*  Because I want you to digest it.
*  This is like, this is built into every script of every romantic comedy and every action
*  movie.
*  Like everything's, you know, there's a challenge, then there's moving forward and then things
*  are about to go well and then, oh my goodness, they're on the wrong trains.
*  It's going to be a disaster.
*  And then that's the tension build and then there's resolution of some sort.
*  And then sometimes there's a twist at the end where the resolution isn't there and that's
*  how you get a sequel, right?
*  It's kind of the same thing.
*  I wonder and I hope that someday neuroscience will understand the kind of what the core
*  algorithms in the brain are for a story.
*  A story that involves a question and a hypothesis, some characters and some trajectory, a potential
*  error and then some resolution and then maybe it opens up the possibility of mystery again.
*  As you describe a magic trick or a mentalist act, it seems to follow that sequence.
*  You introduce the people, the cards, the props, et cetera.
*  And then there's a story and here's what's interesting.
*  I see this in comedy also.
*  One of the things that's exciting is when we think we know what's going to happen next
*  and it's either that we are very surprised, there's a violation of the expectation.
*  But even more interesting sometimes is when we're like, no, no, no, no, no.
*  Where we think that something's going to happen and you're actually taking us towards
*  that unbelievable possibility.
*  This is something I find amazing that sometimes even when we expect something or especially
*  when we expect something, if it's an outrageous outcome, there's no way that's when we are
*  most excited.
*  Because we're involved.
*  We're part of the drama.
*  So I love what you said about the idea of a recipe, Mike, following verbatim in a passive
*  way.
*  I don't know how it works, but eventually think this would lead me to a cake somehow
*  as opposed to understand what the chemistry is and why this happens and why this and that.
*  I think that you become more invested and you are part of the act.
*  So it's almost like when I am obsessed also with painting, something that I just do often.
*  And I remember I can easily recall the experience I had when I went to a museum and watched
*  some art before I painted.
*  And the way I view it today as a painter, as someone who's touched pigments, mixed them,
*  put them on a canvas or paper.
*  And all of a sudden I look at it a little differently.
*  And I think it changes the interaction that I have with the painting.
*  I understand the language.
*  I understand the struggle.
*  I understand the challenges.
*  I understand all of that.
*  And it's the same with anything.
*  When you read one of my favorite reads of all time to this day, it is Van Gogh's letters.
*  I remember I saw Van Gogh before.
*  I saw it after.
*  And the story, and that's why I think we can talk about AI for a second, but the story
*  of the letters with the paintings make them complete different images.
*  When I see now the sunflowers or the chairs or the landscapes, and I have some context
*  to go by, they become a part of a much bigger story.
*  And to me that enhances the experience.
*  A few friends, me and a couple of my friends, went to a museum at the Met.
*  And there was a beautiful wooden sphere, half opened like that.
*  And the detail was like you need a microscope to see and to appreciate the delicate carving
*  of the wood.
*  And we all looked at it in awe.
*  It was like, it's amazing.
*  And I said to them, you know, you look at it and you see the year, it's from the 1800s.
*  And they go, wow, the technology they had in 1800s to do that, and the patience and
*  the time, all of it is part of the artwork.
*  What if I told you, hey, we fooled you, this was 3D printed 20 minutes ago.
*  It took about five minutes.
*  And we can make a million of them right now.
*  It's the exact same object.
*  It looks as impressive, but the story is different.
*  And I think that is, again, part of the experience we have.
*  A recipe, when you understand it, the experience you have is different.
*  So I do believe that knowledge really can enhance an experience, change it completely.
*  So that's something I'm big on.
*  seem to be the kind of bento box that arranges information best, in my opinion.
*  You know, for those that don't know, bento box, right?
*  Like a box with a little different compartments and you have different things.
*  And you know, the brain can, okay, let's just acknowledge some first principles, ground
*  truths.
*  We can only perceive a certain number of things at any one time, but we're sensing tons of
*  information.
*  So the brain is a selective filter and a prediction machine.
*  And it does a bunch of other things to keep us alive, but that's basically it.
*  All my neuroscience colleagues are probably like, wait, wait, wait, but what about this?
*  Okay, but that's pretty much it.
*  Keep us alive, predict things and perceive certain things that we can sense, not others.
*  Things outside our sensory apparatus, like infrared vision and sensing, you know, certain
*  forms of heat and electromagnetic energy.
*  Some yes, some no.
*  Depends on what animal you are.
*  Okay, so stories and the sequencing of things seems to be one way in which we best learn
*  information from the time we are very little, we are read stories and our lives play out
*  like stories.
*  So I think that the idea that additional information about context, this is from the 1800s, not
*  just the box that it's encapsulated in, but it gives you a sense this is important.
*  It tells you this was harder to do back then, hard, presumably.
*  And as you said, it brings to mind all these ideas about what went into that, like the
*  pyramids.
*  They're very, very interesting, but especially interesting given when they were built.
*  And what that meant for certain people and not for others.
*  So I think that, so there's that, which I think is so key because it extends way past
*  magic is really about how the brain works and learns information and perceives the world
*  in moments and what we remember, what we don't remember.
*  And then there's another thing that I'd like to touch into and maybe we touch into this
*  first, which is that you mentioned that you paint.
*  So I've come to learn that many people who are virtuosos in their craft as you are have
*  hobbies or practices or things that they do that are sort of adjacent to craft.
*  I think Joni Mitchell, the singer, often talked about painting as a way to get into a mindset
*  of singing, even though that wasn't the specific intention.
*  It just kind of led there a little bit like a sprinter might have, I don't know, some
*  dynamic stretching that they do that's sort of like semi-related, but not the main thing.
*  Or maybe they would listen to music and kind of bounce around to the music.
*  Maybe that's a better example.
*  So it's not directly in line with the practice, but it puts the brain circuits that are required
*  for that practice into a certain mode.
*  For you, maybe it's painting.
*  For me, it's drawing.
*  How often do you paint?
*  What do you paint?
*  And do you paint with the intention of anyone ever seeing your paintings?
*  Yes, I'm not sure.
*  I post them in my show.
*  It was an opportunity for me to make a portrait of all of my heroes.
*  So it was a mini exhibition as people walked into the theater to see all those portraits
*  of the people that affected me, influenced me and so forth.
*  Magicians?
*  I would say 90, most of them.
*  Avner was there too.
*  He's not a magician per se.
*  He's also a magician.
*  But yeah, mainly magicians.
*  Houdini was a, Melini, Tommy Wonder, Chan Canasta, David Blaine, people that really are part
*  of who I am today.
*  So to me, that's an aspect of its own.
*  Why do I paint these people?
*  It's because it's an opportunity for me to meditate with these people that I adore and
*  owe so much to.
*  But why do I paint?
*  First of all, it's intuitive.
*  It was not a cerebral decision.
*  I think I need something to supplement my life.
*  I need painting.
*  I always love to work with my hands.
*  I always love to draw.
*  I love imagery.
*  I love design.
*  And I always gravitated towards wanting to paint.
*  And by the way, most of the things I do, they're not like, I don't look at them through a scientific
*  point of view.
*  I do them intuitively and then later I understand in a more scientific way why, or I ask scientific
*  questions, why am I doing those things?
*  And I think for art is important.
*  Start with intuition, start with what makes sense to you or feels right, and then start
*  asking questions.
*  The whys and hows and what does it mean?
*  Painting in itself, there's lots of science.
*  If you mix blue with yellow, every time you're going to get green, that's science.
*  But when you paint, I think you need to forget about the science.
*  It needs to live in the back of your mind and you need to let your, I don't know what,
*  your spirit, your mojo take over and paint with you.
*  But I started to learn so much about magic from painting.
*  And I'll tell you why.
*  You need a bird eye every now and then.
*  You need to detach yourself from something that you do so much of and you build all these
*  biases.
*  Right?
*  When I approach a trick or I work on a trick, I come with a similar approach.
*  It almost becomes formulaic.
*  And formula is poison for art.
*  When you approach something with a predetermined, you know, preconceived notion of doing something,
*  you might repeat yourself so much that it's boring.
*  And you're not allowing yourself to grow and to maybe find things that you never knew existed
*  in you or outside of you.
*  So painting, in a weird way, when I read biographies of, let's say, Lucian Freud, who
*  I really love, and he's talking about art, at some point I feel like I'm reading a magic
*  book.
*  It's so applicable to magic.
*  He's talking about intention.
*  He's talking about, you know, I'm going to misquote him for sure.
*  He says, every time I approach a canvas, I approach it as if it's the first painting
*  I've ever painted.
*  In this instance, to take it even further, the painting that was ever painted.
*  Because he wants to approach it with the attitude of a student, with the naivete, with the virginity
*  of first time.
*  So you don't repeat the same shtick, oh, you do this, I've done this before, I can do this
*  again.
*  You kind of want to divorce yourself from all these things you know and start the search
*  again from as close as possible to this first time.
*  Because there's something beautiful about that.
*  There's a technique that painters use.
*  Andrew Wyeth did it a lot.
*  He will paint the painting.
*  He would look at it and say, something is wrong about it.
*  And I don't know what.
*  Something is, there's something about this painting that just does not work.
*  Then he will take the painting and look at it with a mirror.
*  So he looks at the reflection of the painting.
*  So he flips the image, very much like the way we think at night.
*  And when he looks at the reflection, he goes, ah, the nose is wrong.
*  He couldn't see it.
*  When he looked at it, he couldn't see that the wrong was off or distorted.
*  But when he saw the reflection, he could.
*  Because he was able to cancel his biases.
*  He saw almost a cousin painting of the one he just made, which is a beautiful thing.
*  But this analogy also, I think, acts for me with magic.
*  It's a way for me to look at magic from a mirror, to look at it differently, from a
*  different angle.
*  Because art, I find that the arts are very much connected.
*  There's so much similarities.
*  And when I lecture to magicians about magic, I quote art books more than I quote magic
*  books.
*  I quote Cervantes from Don Quixote about magic.
*  Someone wrote a book in the 1600s, and he talks about what we like to call the two impossible
*  theory, not the two perfect theory, the two impossible theory.
*  And he talks about that perfection in writing is restraining exaggeration.
*  And it's a whole paragraph about that art needs to be believable.
*  There has to be truth in it to be enjoyed.
*  So it's so much true for magic.
*  I can't just, even when we do something that's impossible, I still want the ground to be
*  plausible.
*  Maybe this could happen.
*  Therefore I need to restrain exaggeration.
*  I need to restrain the impossibility.
*  And that again, this is a novel from the 1600s, Don Quixote, my favorite book of all time,
*  teaching us about magic.
*  And Lucine Freud is teaching me about magic, and Andrew Wyeth, and van Gogh, and all these
*  people.
*  So I think that's why I love this diversity of, you know, I love photography very much.
*  I always have a camera with me, film photography, I love.
*  And composition.
*  No one uses that word usually with adjacent to magic.
*  They never talk about, oh, it's a composition.
*  But if you understand a composition, and you apply it to magic, you have a whole new
*  way of looking at how to create a piece of magic.
*  Just by using that word, that term, that painters and photographers use.
*  So that's to me just an amazing reason, a good reason to paint.
*  I love that you're touching into some of the core modulars, the ground truths of art and
*  of magic and how they overlap.
*  Because what we're really talking about here are ways in which the brain works, stories
*  and this restraining exaggeration.
*  I'll just share two things.
*  I'll try and keep it brief.
*  One is that, again, Rick Rubin, incredibly virtuoso and at the level of creativity and
*  bringing out people's best in terms of music, other domains too, but mostly music.
*  Often says that the art has to have some recognizable feature, like this artist that
*  people have perhaps heard before, but then something new.
*  But you can't completely depart from what was done before.
*  There has to be some recognition.
*  You also talked about wiping away, using a completely new canvas.
*  This example you gave, when Rick came to our studio here, he looked around and he goes,
*  oh, I like this place.
*  He's very into physical spaces and the walls here are black.
*  There's some other stuff too.
*  He said, because both Rick and I came up through punk rock music.
*  He's like, yeah, I think a smaller place, black walls, cool.
*  His studio is mostly white.
*  Then he said, but I'd get rid of all the art and the plants.
*  I said, why?
*  He said, because it's distracting.
*  He doesn't have art or awards on his walls.
*  It's all blank so that every new project is a completely new project.
*  That's interesting.
*  There's no previous stimuli entering the picture.
*  It's a new project.
*  You don't want pictures of awards that you won for that album or anything.
*  I go, what do you do with all that stuff?
*  He's like, just get rid of it.
*  Me too, by the way.
*  I totally understand that.
*  Very interesting.
*  So clean slate.
*  The other thing that just is so striking to me is this idea that there has to be something
*  that is a truth, a mathematical or a physical truth present in art.
*  One of the best ways that one can understand how the brain creates perceptions is that
*  the brain creates abstractions of what's out in the outside world.
*  Light, sound, touch, smell, taste come in.
*  That's all translated to electrical and chemical signals.
*  Then the brain reconstructs an image.
*  By the way, the lens of the eye, you'll find this interesting as a photographer, inverts
*  and reverses the image so that when it lands in the brain, the neural retina first stage
*  of visual processing, I'm looking at you, you're right side up, but you're actually
*  landing on the perception in my brain is that you're upside down and flipped.
*  I am.
*  Now you got me.
*  You had me for a second.
*  I am too.
*  Then the brain reconstructs an upright image.
*  It's really wild.
*  The brain is constantly making abstractions about what's out there.
*  If I were to say, take a photograph of you and show you a picture of your face, you'd
*  say, yeah, that's me.
*  But if I said, aha, but I'm an abstract artist and to me, you look like, and I basically
*  do a bunch of squiggles and I show you, it doesn't look anything like your face, you'd
*  say, yeah, I don't see it.
*  However, if I somehow have the artistic genius, which I don't, to create an image of you where
*  the eyes are distorted, their position, or maybe the shading, something is different
*  in a way that lets you see and other people see your face in a way that is similar enough
*  to us, the wind that we recognize you, but different enough that it looks interesting.
*  We're effectively creating the kind of abstraction that the brain creates, like some level of
*  interest in an emotion or in a something, right?
*  A reflection in your eye could be, who knows, right?
*  And so the brain is an abstraction machine.
*  It doesn't actually know what's out there.
*  It's taking best guesses.
*  And so I think when we see great art, it's able to capture enough of the real physical
*  truth of that thing, but to touch into some of the ways in which the brain abstracts.
*  I'll give one more example, Rothko's, which are simply, to some people who don't like
*  them, I love Rothko's, are simply color on canvas.
*  But Rothko, whether or not he intended it or not, did something absolutely spectacular
*  with his art, which was he eliminated the white space and the canvas, and in doing so,
*  was able to allow things to come forward in color space, as we call in visual neuroscience.
*  Certain colors are not visible unless they are adjacent to other colors.
*  And when you eliminate all the white space, the canvas, and you take away the frame, then
*  seen before and color transitions that you can't see pop.
*  And that's the brilliance of a Rothko.
*  It's not that it's two colors and a square and a rectangle, and this is why they're worth
*  millions and millions of dollars.
*  They're so spectacular because they capture a physical truth about color space that's
*  inaccessible in a framed painting or a painting that includes some visibility of the canvas.
*  So Rothko shows us color space, the math of how the brain produces color contrast and
*  hue and wavelength intensity, and color is also intimately tied to value in the brain
*  in a very interesting way.
*  And we're not looking at it thinking all that, but we feel something that's like, if we appreciate
*  Rothko's, like, hmm, that's interesting.
*  That captivates me.
*  Does that make sense?
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Do we know that Rothko did it through that lens of understanding?
*  Probably not.
*  Did he do the science you just described, or did he just intuitively felt this is a
*  great composition, these are great color scheme, and I will do that?
*  What do we know?
*  It's most likely the latter.
*  I have a colleague, Bevel Conway, who's at the National Institutes of Health, who's far
*  more versed in this stuff than I am, so he might correct me.
*  I'd love to get him on the podcast sometime.
*  But it's very likely that Rothko felt something upon seeing colors in a restricted kind of
*  tunnel of vision and then realized that if this could be brought to scale, because Rothko's
*  tend to be pretty large, then something special was happening.
*  Sort of like Chuck Close took tiny little images of faces, and now he had a visual issue
*  with faces, Professor Agnusia, et cetera, so people can look that up, failure to recognize
*  faces as faces.
*  They just look like objects and realize that he could create composites of these things
*  as a big face, and it's a very different experience to look at a face that's made up of tiny fragments
*  of many, many faces.
*  Now, here's where it gets interesting, because there are many, many artists that sit out
*  in front of museums like the Met and sell paintings that are very inexpensive, that
*  are very accurate renditions of things.
*  Picture of Taylor Swift, picture of Bob Marley, not interesting.
*  That's cool they can do it, or the real, the kind of curbside trickery, take a painting,
*  paint in front of people, what's he or she doing, and then flip it over, it's the person.
*  It's cool in the moment, because you're like, wow, they can paint upside down, but actually
*  it's not interesting at all, because what they've created is basically a decent photograph-ish
*  image just upside down.
*  So they might as well hang upside down while they do it.
*  It's not interesting.
*  It's not great art.
*  So what I think what we're converging on is that great art takes us through a trajectory
*  that involves the, I believe now after this discussion, that takes us through the arc
*  of excellent storytelling.
*  It involves a surprise, recognition of truth, a return to mystery, all these components
*  that you described for magic are present in art and presumably are present in a great
*  song or play as well.
*  You know, I love everything you said, and I often contemplate about why I respond to
*  a certain painting, but the painting outside the mat of the guy I don't.
*  And I never, I was never able to come up with a sufficient answer, but this is as close
*  as I got.
*  And I often ask, why do I like this, but not this?
*  Why do I like that, and I don't like this?
*  I think that I, making a judgment about the motives of the painter, and do I believe him?
*  Is it honest?
*  Is it a true honest expression that extends out of him on a canvas?
*  And a lot of times, and that's the closest I got, I go and I see these patterns and dripping
*  the paint and the splatter and this and that, and it's super, like a lot of people, wow,
*  this is cool, and I'm the snob who goes, I think it's shit.
*  And the reason is, when I see it, I think, I think I see the motive.
*  He says, I'm going to do something cool.
*  I'm going to do something that is eye candy, and I'm going to use every trick in the book
*  to make it happen.
*  As opposed to somebody like Lucien, who paints with his guts, I believe every brush stroke.
*  I believe it's an honest painting that comes from here, and there's no motive to try to
*  wow you or to tell you, look, I'm the best, I'm so great.
*  So that's as close as I got to understanding why I respond to a Lucien Freud, but not to
*  that street artist who does this, you know, sparkles with his, I don't know, toothpaste.
*  I don't know.
*  I, you know, took everything I had, all the top-down inhibition to not go, yes, yes.
*  I think that the critical distinction is that the street artist is doing it for the audience,
*  for people, and for the sale.
*  They're doing it to make a living.
*  And audience pleaser.
*  Right.
*  Whereas the other artists, the sort of, let's call them the greats, are doing it for themselves.
*  It's something in them that needs to get out.
*  And it's honest.
*  Right.
*  There's so many examples that just leap to mind.
*  I'll use one from a completely different domain.
*  I grew up skateboarding.
*  I was not good enough to make it a career, but I have great appreciation for it.
*  There was a guy in the 90s, he's still around.
*  Sadly, he suffered an injury.
*  I had him paralyzed for a while, but now he's walking, cycling, and skateboarding again.
*  His name is John Cardiel.
*  John Cardiel is just a legend in the landscape of skateboarding.
*  I knew him back when, still know him a bit.
*  And the way he would do things was just so spectacular.
*  Just the energy in it.
*  It wasn't because it was so big and so far and all of that.
*  Yes, but there was something in the energy of it.
*  And I'll never forget, there's a documentary about him.
*  I'll put a link to it in the show note captions, where someone's describing a conversation
*  they had with him where he does something spectacular.
*  And then he shows up, he sort of goes up to his friend and his friend said, yeah, at that
*  moment, John turned to him and he goes, that one was for me.
*  And I just, I think of that now, like John, like cards, as they call him, just it always
*  looked like everyone was delight, just thrilled by what he does.
*  Right?
*  He's a true virtuoso.
*  But it's the sense that he's not doing it for your entertainment.
*  He's doing it for him.
*  It's the expression of something inside.
*  Rick talks about great art as your own offering to God.
*  This is not about your audience.
*  This is you and your thing, whatever is inside you, and it's your offering to God.
*  And I think it's such a key thing.
*  It's the exact opposite of someone doing something to please the audience.
*  And of course, one delights in audiences being pleased, but that can't be how you approach
*  your magic.
*  It must be because it just feels so good.
*  The truth is, the show I create Inner Circle, it was created because I wanted to do that
*  show.
*  I mean, if you tell me somebody's going to come and watch an hour and a half of somebody
*  doing a bunch of card tricks, it sounds boring.
*  But I think every art form is an excuse to tell something bigger.
*  Van Gogh recorded his sensations when he looked at the sunflowers and record his emotions
*  on a canvas.
*  Every brushstroke, the speed in which he placed every brushstroke and the colors he chose
*  to put, every decision he made was a recording of his sensations, his state of being at that
*  moment when he painted it.
*  So who cares about sunflowers?
*  We've seen a lot of bouquets of flowers and roses and this.
*  Matisse has this famous quote.
*  He says that the hardest thing to paint is a rose because one has to first forget about
*  all the roses he painted before, were painted before.
*  And that's, it's so true because to me, a still life is something that students do in
*  art schools.
*  Here's a bouquet of flowers painted.
*  So why are we looking at Van Gogh and saying, wow, the sunflowers, what a beautiful piece
*  of, it's because the sunflowers are just an excuse for him to record something of him.
*  He recorded him himself on the canvas.
*  And that's what we're seeing.
*  We're seeing the personality, the excitement, the obsessiveness that he had.
*  And I think that's, that's one of us.
*  To me, I mean, I always start with, I want to do this show because I think it's beautiful
*  because I think it has something to say.
*  I hope people like it.
*  I love people too.
*  And to me, the people are also part of the brushstrokes.
*  I make a lot of room in my show for people to flourish, to become a part of the show.
*  That's part of the expression that I'm trying to create.
*  It's not just about me.
*  It's about them too.
*  But that's an artistic choice in itself.
*  Where do you draw, I don't want to say inspiration, but the components for a show.
*  So I can think of, you can look historically and see what people have done, learned from
*  masters, teachers, from your own experiences.
*  Like if you, let's say you were to travel to Australia or South America, would you bring
*  back components of your travels to the show you create?
*  I don't know.
*  Or what's your process for figuring out or sensing into what you want to do?
*  And I feel like discussions like this are very important for people to hear because
*  not everyone wants to be a magician or mentalist or scientist or podcaster.
*  But what we're getting down to here are the core components of creative expression.
*  So where do you draw on the, what do you bring?
*  Is it your daily experience?
*  Does it come to you in the form of a bodily sensation?
*  Is it in your dreams?
*  Is it in your discussions?
*  Do you try and resurrect cool things from the past?
*  Where do you draw from?
*  It's all of it.
*  It's really all of it.
*  I'm a sponge of everything around me.
*  I interact with art, with books, with information, with friends, conversations.
*  Everything is a source of inspiration.
*  Everything is.
*  And it goes through my filter.
*  Like I'm always amazed at the fact that, you know, 20 students can paint the exact same
*  thing.
*  The exact same thing.
*  Please, this is a flower painted and you'll have 20 completely different paintings.
*  Is because everybody, I think, filters this information through their sensory, whatever
*  it is.
*  And I think that's what we, at least that's what I think I'm doing.
*  I'm constantly consuming not just art, everything.
*  A flower, this, a conversation with a friend.
*  Social media?
*  Maybe, you know what?
*  Yes, yes.
*  I think everything affects me.
*  Me sitting with you right now will affect me.
*  Will change me.
*  Will become a part of the mosaic of experiences I have and it will affect me.
*  Like this conversation right now is changing me.
*  Maybe I'm poetic about it, but I really think that way.
*  I think that, you know, if I had any success, I owe it to all of the people that surround
*  me.
*  You know, terrific painter Laura Alexander, who's unbelievable.
*  Her contribution to me is immense.
*  I mean, and maybe you can draw direct lines, maybe you can't.
*  But I feel like every person that was part of my life is the reason, the outcome that
*  I produce is because of those people.
*  So I don't know if I don't look for, I don't search for inspiration.
*  I think what I do at least, I really want to let things sink in.
*  And I want to consume.
*  I'm curious.
*  I always want to know more.
*  To listen to more, to see more.
*  Like, for example, if I go to a museum and I see a painting, I like to dwell on why do
*  I like it?
*  Why am I responding to this?
*  Why is this triggering me?
*  What is this revealing about me?
*  I don't think there's one way that I say, oh, this is the process.
*  This happens, I do this, then a trick is born.
*  Sometimes it's the Tommy Wander story, right?
*  I see someone who's doing a trick and the explanation to the trick is way prettier.
*  And I go, wow, it's amazing that the things behind the curtain are more interesting than
*  things in front of the curtain.
*  That to me, it planted a seed and five years later, there was a piece.
*  So yeah, I think inspiration is become a sponge.
*  You know, you need to consume.
*  This I learned from my friend Jamie in Switzerland.
*  He says to do good art, you have to consume art, create art, get critiqued.
*  Just do those three things.
*  Consume art, create art, and get critiqued.
*  Also when you consume art, it reveals something about you.
*  So at first when I started painting, I loved everything.
*  Surrealism, pointillism, give me hyperrealism, and slowly it narrowed down.
*  Because through observing art, I started to learn about what triggers me.
*  The art revealed, taught me what am I responding to, what pushes those buttons, right?
*  And I think that's a valuable, important step in becoming an artist.
*  Consume art and let it teach you something about you.
*  Then create art and then critique it by yourself and maybe people you trust.
*  I think again, you do those three things, you're pretty good.
*  I was trying to understand that in your magic and mentalist work, you're a storyteller.
*  To some extent, to some extent.
*  The characters can involve cards or numbers or information and you cast people in the
*  audience often into those stories.
*  Depending on what they give you, you might assign them a different role.
*  You do know what the conclusion of the story could be, it maybe ought to be.
*  Sometimes there's some element of surprise even for you.
*  But that you're working with a certain palette of paints and they're predictable enough that
*  you can get where you want to go.
*  But as you said before, that the improvisation of it is part of the delight for you.
*  Absolutely.
*  And because people are resonating with your emotions, there's this empathic attunement
*  that you create that people also feel like they're part of the experience.
*  It's so very different to watch something that you do on YouTube versus to be in a small
*  setting versus a larger setting.
*  All of these are spectacular and we'll provide links to these.
*  If you get the opportunity to see Aasi live, you absolutely should do it.
*  It will clearly fall into the far extreme of amazing experiences that you'll have, I
*  guarantee it.
*  I think in discussing what art is and people thinking about learning, I think often we
*  wonder if you're a sponge, you're taking in everything, but do you constrain your days
*  in a way that you're hanging out at the Met, you're not looking at the stuff on the sidewalk
*  outside the Met as much.
*  So you have a taste, you have a sense of taste, what you like and you're drawing from different
*  things.
*  I delight in animals of all kinds and so much of what I do and so much of what I think about
*  in terms of how the human animal works is based on some overlap with the core modules
*  that exist in other animals.
*  And I won't take us down that path, but I just delight in animals.
*  That's why I follow so many raccoon accounts on Instagram.
*  So I'm trying to figure out when you walk us through a day, you are a night owl.
*  We talked about this before.
*  So what time do you go to sleep at night?
*  I mean, typically 4 a.m.
*  4 a.m. is when you go to sleep.
*  And it's not just because you're a performing artist on stage, you've always been this way.
*  Yeah.
*  And a lot of magicians are.
*  And my mom is the same way.
*  My brother, maybe he's a little changed now, but he's also, if he follows his nature, he
*  will fall asleep around four and I wake up around noon, 2 p.m.
*  Do you wear an eye mask or curtains?
*  Yes, a little bit of light and I'm through.
*  Okay.
*  So then you wake up.
*  What do you do?
*  I was about to call it your morning routine, but your afternoon, your hour afternoon, your
*  morning, your morning.
*  What is your typical thing?
*  Do you pay attention to your dreams?
*  Do you recall your dreams?
*  Is there information there?
*  I don't know.
*  I do know that a lot of my resolution, I resolve a lot of tricks or magic in general.
*  It's problem solving.
*  And a lot of times I have a problem and I can't solve it.
*  And as you said, it happens a lot.
*  I sleep, I see everything reversed, and then I come up with a solution.
*  In the morning, it's a clear as day to me.
*  That's what needs to be done.
*  Do you write it down or you just do it?
*  Immediately I put to practice.
*  I literally just, I'll grab, if it's a deck of cards, I would say, okay, I need to do
*  this and I will burn it into a muscle memory.
*  But definitely, nighttime is where most of the thinking happens.
*  I sleep well.
*  I think I sleep pretty well.
*  I try, I mean, I try to start very relaxed.
*  I want the first few hours of my day to be pretty relaxed.
*  It's usually a ritual.
*  I have a coffee machine where you need to grind the coffee, you need to do everything.
*  And I love the ritual of making the first cup of coffee.
*  That's the first thing I do.
*  I try to avoid answering emails or things that are urgent or that.
*  I don't want to start my day with this energy.
*  Are you on social media early in the day?
*  No, no, no.
*  I consume social media to a degree and I think it has a place.
*  I mean, there's some beautiful things I found on social media that shows I want to see friends
*  do beautiful work and they post it and it's wonderful paintings.
*  There's lots of things.
*  Social media is not a black and white thing for me that, oh, it's just bad.
*  I think it's a platform and you can curate it in such a way that is beneficial, interesting
*  and could give you valuable information.
*  It's the obsessiveness, it's the intensity that's a little, and the fact that there are
*  no filters or there's an algorithm deciding for you what you should see.
*  That's a little scary.
*  But no, I start the day with those things and slowly I go for a walk or I love walking.
*  My thinking, I think better when I walk.
*  What's the logic behind that?
*  Yeah, well, I'm delighting this.
*  First of all, the way you describe your morning routine is very similar to Rick Rubin's morning
*  routine.
*  He wants to capture some of the elements from sleep, ease into the day gradually, walk,
*  get sunlight and allow whatever processing occurred in sleep and in the liminal states
*  around the morning and the clarity that comes with the early day to crystallize into ideas
*  and not deal with email and kind of operational things.
*  It's a set of mind.
*  If I start now taking care of emails in this and I need to send that in the package, then
*  that dictates the day for me.
*  What's tactical.
*  What's interesting is it's tactical.
*  It's not creative.
*  In fact, by definition, it's not creative because it's being defined by what other people
*  put on there.
*  There's an investor, I forget his name, great investor, hedge fund guy, young kid.
*  I can't remember, so forgive me.
*  But this quote is not mine.
*  He said that email is basically a public post to do list.
*  People are telling you where to drive your attention and behavior.
*  Your process is very similar to Rick's.
*  I like to write and I have most of my clarity in the morning as well, although sometimes
*  too many tactical things enter my framework.
*  I'm working on that.
*  I think that what you describe is the life of an artist and a creative, capturing the
*  unique components of what was put together in your brain based on your unique experiences.
*  It's from you and for you and ultimately people benefit because they delight and are astonished
*  by the end result.
*  What you describe sounds to me like an amazing and a perfect day for a creative.
*  I think it's so important for people to hear.
*  What you describe also runs countercurrent to what most people do during their days,
*  which is to immediately allow the context and the tactics of their actions and thinking
*  to be driven by some external force that is not from them.
*  It's from someone else's mind.
*  It's incredibly, there's a strong gravitational pull.
*  What's in the news?
*  What are people saying?
*  What's in my text?
*  What do people want from me?
*  What do people think of me, et cetera?
*  That is absolutely poisonous for creative work.
*  It's pollution.
*  It puts you in a panic mode.
*  By the way, we have so much stuff to do that we'll never catch up with anything.
*  Let's make peace with that.
*  You'll never catch up with what you need to do because it's exhausting.
*  So I understand that the first few hours I can devote to me, to feeling good, relaxed.
*  And slowly I will introduce, okay, what do I want to do right now?
*  What's the first thing I want to tackle?
*  In urgency, I was practicing the Rubik's Cube.
*  So I had a Rubik's Cube right next to me on my side.
*  And the first thing I wanted to do by choice is to do and start solving a Rubik's Cube
*  because I had to get good at it for a routine of mine.
*  So I would like to start today with, as you said, my own decisions, things I want to do
*  first.
*  This will make me happy.
*  Then I'm going to do it.
*  Or I have a deck of cards next to me, right next to me.
*  And there's a move I'm trying to get right.
*  And the first thing I want to do is try it in the morning.
*  That's another reason I love cards so much.
*  It's tactile.
*  Even though in my new show, which we can talk about, I decided there will be no more cards.
*  It's just, you know, it's a tribute to the human mind.
*  It's called Incredibly Human.
*  And it's about the things that are possible and yet they're on the verge of impossible.
*  So a form of rendition of it was when I memorized the entire audience.
*  I know everybody by name.
*  And it's just a skill.
*  I memorized 120 people every night.
*  Do you use a mnemonic approach where you, you know, like Andrew sounds like or reminds
*  you of some other things or are you doing a paired association?
*  Sure.
*  Sure.
*  There's a, there was, he just died at 97, something like that.
*  Old man, but he was sharp to his last day.
*  Harry Lorraine was a memory guy.
*  He performed as a magician, but also taught people how to remember things.
*  Wrote a lot of books.
*  So I, and he was known for that.
*  He was on the Carson show.
*  He memorized the entire audience and it was really cool.
*  It was his signature piece of his and I wanted to do it in my show.
*  So we called him and said, can we get permission to use that piece?
*  And he says, sure.
*  So can we meet with you and you teach me, you know, those little details, the minutiae?
*  And I came with a notebook and a pen.
*  I'm ready to take notes.
*  How do you remember 120 people every night?
*  120 people, those names.
*  So I'm, okay, so what's the work on it?
*  And he goes, you just remember them.
*  You're saying first and last names or first names?
*  First and last.
*  First and last names.
*  Yeah, you can do first.
*  He did first and last.
*  Yeah.
*  So he says, you just remember them.
*  Yeah, but tell me the techniques.
*  I thought it was a joke.
*  I wrote nothing that day, nothing.
*  And I was so scared of it.
*  And I tried to remember people and I couldn't and it was so daunting.
*  And I realized that in order to remember a lot of people's names, the first thing you
*  need to conquer is fear.
*  It's fear.
*  I was afraid that I won't be able to do it.
*  And one night I did a small venue with like 30 people showed up.
*  I said, okay, that's manageable.
*  I can memorize 30 people.
*  So I did it.
*  And you don't know that you know their names until you do it.
*  All I do is I shake their hands.
*  Oh, thank you so much.
*  Please take your seat.
*  I was the usher.
*  Sit down.
*  Thank you.
*  Now the show starts.
*  And this is a test for me.
*  Do I remember their names?
*  I don't know.
*  And I go, Susan, blah, blah, blah, blah.
*  And I was able to do all their names.
*  Do you still remember any of their names?
*  I'll tell you a story about that.
*  Remind me though.
*  I will.
*  I'll come back to that.
*  So it felt like I had superpowers.
*  It was as amazing to me, I think, as it was maybe to them.
*  And then I started doing it in that venue with about 60 people.
*  So I remember I have everybody sit down.
*  And there's a point in the show where I take two coins, large coins, and I glue them with
*  tape on my head.
*  So I'm blindfolded.
*  And I saw two Rubik's cubes at the same time, blindfolded.
*  And I forgot, talking about memory, I forgot to have somebody just have a stopwatch to
*  time me how long it takes me to do it.
*  I just forgot.
*  And I go, guys, I'm so sorry, I forgot.
*  Does anybody here has a watch or an app that he can measure to take time?
*  And one guy goes, yeah, I can do it.
*  And I recognized his voice.
*  And I did not know I could do it.
*  I go, Robert?
*  And he goes, yes.
*  So I did not just remember how they look.
*  I remember how they sound.
*  And you didn't know that you remembered how they sound.
*  It was just part of your-
*  It was a surprise to me.
*  And then, and it's crazy, you're sitting next to Susan, right?
*  And Stephanie.
*  And I describe how they look like, almost to a T. And it amazes me how much we do remember.
*  And that's crazy because the voice, like, your voice, my voice, people's voices are
*  very distinct.
*  And now I know it.
*  That I can hear somebody peripheral, you know, and I know.
*  So that's about memory.
*  How do we get to these memories?
*  So to your question, you asked me if you use the mnemonics or stuff.
*  The truth is, we need to care.
*  If you care about someone's name, like, let's assume you see somebody in a coffee shop and
*  the one thing you really want is to talk to this person because you're attracted to them.
*  I don't know.
*  And you say, hi, nice to meet you.
*  I'm Asi.
*  What's your name?
*  The moment they say their name, you will never forget it because you care.
*  You want.
*  At times we say, hey, what's your name?
*  We don't mean it.
*  We don't care about the answer.
*  And that's a big part of why we don't remember it.
*  But if I say, you need to meet this guy, this guy, you should know him.
*  You will make an effort.
*  So the one thing I did the most was repeat their name.
*  What's your name?
*  Andrew.
*  Oh, Andrew, nice to meet you.
*  I repeated a few times as I talked to them or we have a little conversation.
*  And I also realized that the more you interact with them, the more you remember it.
*  So in the show, I always, I faked it.
*  I struggled on the last two people.
*  I said, I don't know your names.
*  Remain standing.
*  I'll get back to you.
*  And it was Genevieve.
*  I remember the story.
*  Genevieve say, you know, I don't know her name yet.
*  So I say, I don't remember your name, but you told me you just came from Africa.
*  You were on vacation for two weeks.
*  And I start recalling so much information about her.
*  And Genevieve, I'll never forget your name.
*  And she sits down.
*  It's amazing.
*  But the more they tell you about themselves, the more you retain and the more you remember
*  because, as I said, it's a story.
*  And now Genevieve is just not, it's not just a random person with the name Genevieve.
*  It's somebody who's been to that place and this place.
*  And she's, you know, you can connect it to a story or to something you can visualize.
*  Right.
*  Every now and then, you know, Stove, Steve, and, you know, I would make those mnemonics
*  or try to find a feature, almost like the way a caricaturist does, you know,
*  exaggerate a feature and attach it to the name somehow.
*  Like Anthony maybe has lots of ants all over him, you know, stuff like that.
*  But the truth is, I only did it with those I struggled.
*  It was a backup plan.
*  But most of the people, I hear the name, I cared, I wanted, and I had confidence that
*  I could do it.
*  And I did it.
*  The brain definitely remembers information that has an emotional salience to it.
*  So caring about something, some set of information, name or otherwise, definitely will help encode
*  to memory.
*  The other is to put things into motifs of song.
*  It is no coincidence that children learn songs to learn the alphabet, A, B, C, D, E, E, E.
*  The inflections, the motifs within that song of the alphabet is what allows us to remember
*  that our entire lives, as opposed to A, B, C, D, E, F, G, A.
*  If you think about the number pi out past 3.14, out to some number of, you know, some
*  people can remember it out very far.
*  You set it to a song with some repeating motifs, like the alphabet song or happy birthday song.
*  That's how people remember very, very far.
*  Because the brain creates these modules.
*  It doesn't take bits of information and just throw it in there.
*  It creates libraries of information where just as in the library, certain books are
*  grouped with other books and more disparate topics are positioned further away in the
*  library from one another.
*  For those of you that are younger than me, you can look up what a library is.
*  Just kidding.
*  But this is how the brain works.
*  It's amazing that you did that.
*  It also just really highlights that when we do this, we are remembering far more than
*  we think we remember.
*  Some people are more visual.
*  Some people more auditory.
*  But it's all coming in there provided that people have access to those senses.
*  It's just spectacular.
*  I have to return to something because I took us away from it, which was you said, is there
*  something about walking that allows for creative thought?
*  I'm of the mind now based on my observation of extremely creative individuals and talking
*  to them as well as some understanding of the neuroscience of creativity, which by the way,
*  there isn't a lot, but it's sort of happening more and more, that there are sort of two
*  polarized states.
*  One is being very, very still with the mind active.
*  This is true of rapid eye movement sleep.
*  We're paralyzed.
*  The mind is very, very active.
*  It's a state in which memories are encoded, especially emotional memories.
*  Many people, his name seems to keep coming up, but Rick Rubin, Karl Deisseroth, Einstein
*  and others reported having practices where they would deliberately sit or lie down to
*  be very still and deliberately make their mind very active, even thinking in complete
*  sentences as a way to come up with ideas, a deliberate practice.
*  The other is to be in movement, but to not really try and force your thinking down a
*  particular trajectory.
*  Some people seem to favor one or the other.
*  I come up with a lot of my ideas while jogging or running or walking as you do.
*  There's something about either stilling the body or making the body just active enough
*  that the mind is allowed to take off down novel trajectories.
*  That's very difficult, I think, for a lot of people to sit down with pen and paper and
*  write things out.
*  Anyway, your practice of walking in the morning is one that perhaps people should want to
*  explore.
*  I think that when people hear about having a super memory for names or being able to
*  read people, so much of what you describe is like being able to read people based on
*  their physicality.
*  All these questions come to mind, and so I can't help myself.
*  Do you believe in these kind of notions, like if people are sitting arms crossed that they're
*  more closed and difficult to get to, whereas people who are more forward leaning in their
*  posture, they're more willing to engage?
*  Does that stuff really hold in your laboratory of experiments of magic and mental mentalism?
*  Body language is something that I read much about.
*  I believe this, I'm not an expert when it comes to body language, but I do think that
*  I don't even control it.
*  It's just somebody can signal a closeness to them or an openness to them.
*  But I also found it to be very misleading a lot of times.
*  People do certain things because they're cold or they're shy, and being shy could be misunderstood
*  as or perceived as snobbish and vice versa.
*  So that could be really misleading.
*  What I rely on is interaction.
*  When I interact with people, or if I'm saying it in the slightest possible way, when I challenge
*  them with something very simple and I see how they deal with it, that reveals a lot
*  about them immediately.
*  Because look, we need to make decisions on the spot.
*  Like, even if I just say, can you please open your hand and I give them something, how eager
*  they are to do it, how they do it, can they follow directions?
*  I want also people that will, you know, that are able to do the things I want them to do
*  for a specific routine.
*  And by the way, certain some routines I would use this type of person.
*  This one needs a teenager.
*  This one I want somebody a little older.
*  Every routine I kind of assign a different character.
*  And again, it's trial and error.
*  I tried with a certain person for a long time and now I get it.
*  It's my relationship, and by the way, as I'm aging, that also changes.
*  Like, there's a piece where I used to do it and I always preferred an older woman.
*  You could see there's some, a motherly quality to it because that's kind of the role she
*  was in.
*  But now, as I'm aging, it's not going to work as well.
*  I think you're creating relationships.
*  Like, for example, I'm a guy and if I work with another guy, that's some sort of an energy.
*  If it's a female, it's different.
*  If it's a young, old...
*  My relationship with these people changes and how they feel.
*  Do they feel comfortable with me?
*  Certain things I can do with a certain individual, but not with another.
*  So that's something I constantly think about.
*  I choose my spectators very, very carefully.
*  You mentioned that you take in things from your environment and from many diverse sources,
*  origin, interactions with people, et cetera.
*  You seem like a very positive person.
*  I generally upbeat and enjoy your work.
*  I get that impression very much.
*  But I'm assuming that you also experience anger, frustration, et cetera.
*  Do you separate that from your creative work?
*  Do you try and buffer yourself against that?
*  The reason I ask is that many of the creatives that I know are artists, of which you are,
*  they're very feeling people.
*  It's required for the craft.
*  You need to be permeable to some extent.
*  But of course you want to be semi-permeable.
*  You don't want every emotion or thing that you encounter to yank you all over the place.
*  But magic is this thing of delight and it's this thing of love.
*  And that all sounds wonderful.
*  How do you deal with things that upset you and frustrate you?
*  Do you actively try and push those out from the creative process or do you incorporate
*  them into the creative process?
*  You want the truth or what do you need?
*  I only want the truth.
*  The truth.
*  The truth is I consider myself a perfectionist and I demand so much of myself and also the
*  people working with me.
*  I could dwell on the smallest detail.
*  I look at the poster and I say the font is wrong.
*  That would bother me.
*  The spacing, the kerning between the letters.
*  It's hard for me to let go of the smallest, smallest, smallest details.
*  I drive myself nuts and I have no doubt that I sometimes, hopefully sometimes, drive my
*  crew nuts.
*  Believe me, I can relate.
*  You know, Grant Hackett, chef from Malinia, a dear friend and one of the greatest minds,
*  one of the smartest people I've ever met.
*  He's a chef.
*  He makes food.
*  But you know, he cares about the plate that the food is going to live in.
*  So he has a guy design the plate for the food that's going to be on top of it.
*  What's the smell in the restaurant?
*  What's the temperature?
*  What's the carpet like?
*  What's the color?
*  Everything counts.
*  There's nothing.
*  Like, for example, I know fine restaurants do this a lot, but it's a nice detail.
*  In his restaurant, when you go to Malinia, they know, with you it's going to be easy
*  because you're very recognizable, but they immediately know your name.
*  No matter who it is, the entire crew, every person in the restaurant knows what you look
*  like and what's your name.
*  And they will address you by your name.
*  That's amazing to me.
*  Allegedly, it's got nothing to do with food, and yet it does because everything counts.
*  And that's the life I live.
*  Everything counts.
*  Every detail is important.
*  Nothing is too small.
*  I drive everybody nuts.
*  That's the truth.
*  And I'm included.
*  Yeah, no, it's really important for people to hear because I know for myself, when I
*  see things that irritate me because of the way they're composed or something, I've had
*  to learn over the years to, I always say I don't run other people's businesses.
*  I'm focused on my stuff.
*  I don't get involved in other people's art.
*  But when I see things that I love and that look right, yeah, it's so satisfying.
*  But to be in the world as you are or as I am, perhaps, it can be frustrating.
*  So we need selective filters.
*  So I guess provided that it's aimed at our craft and that people aim at their craft and
*  what they're creating, then it's great.
*  But it's tricky if one is trying to engage with the world at large to not let this stuff
*  kind of bombard the senses.
*  For somebody that loves great food, it must be frustrating to walk down the street in
*  Manhattan.
*  The smells range from delightful to horrible.
*  So we're a peculiar species as humans, but it's the species that have these unique tunings
*  and these preferences and they lean into those preferences and how they create that produce
*  the marvelous work that is your magic and van Gogh's.
*  That's a...
*  You put me in a good category here.
*  Well, thank you.
*  Yeah, we need...
*  Well, you are and we need people like you.
*  So for you, if you're drawing from many things and there's anger about something you see
*  in the world, frustration, are you able to transmute that into your craft or is it a
*  process of, okay, I got to dump that, move that out so that I can focus on beauty, focus
*  on positive inspiration or can anger and frustration play a role?
*  I think there is beauty even in the ugly.
*  I mean, look, you're right.
*  I live in New York.
*  It's my favorite city in the world and it's a love-hate relationship.
*  It's ugly and beautiful at the same time.
*  It's rich and poor.
*  It's sophisticated and simple.
*  It's a city of opposites.
*  You know, these are things I always think about.
*  Like you go and you see like this area that's really run down and the signs are kind of
*  fading and this and you can think, wow, people are not taking care of it.
*  They're not cleaning this.
*  It's ugly.
*  But you know what?
*  When I have my camera on me, that's what I want to take a photo of.
*  It has character and it tells an amazing story.
*  So to me, the ugly, the old, the ring cold, the not so beautiful is very interesting and
*  beautiful.
*  So and again, it's not that I think about it and then I make the choice.
*  I first respond and then maybe I'll think about it.
*  I usually have a camera on me at all times and the rule is very simple.
*  I don't take a photo until something tickles me.
*  Says, take a photo here.
*  And I take a photo.
*  Some are good, some are bad.
*  I don't care.
*  But something in that moment made me want to do this and take a photo.
*  And a lot of times it's not the obvious, pretty clean stuff.
*  It's sometimes the ugly, the violent.
*  Some of the most beautiful photos ever taken are taken at war by Bersan, right?
*  It's us.
*  It's us and we're interesting even when we're ugly and when we're angry.
*  We're still interesting.
*  So to me that's, yeah, I don't know if I make a distinction.
*  That's very helpful, by the way.
*  Were you always sensory and emotionally tuned to the world around you since you were little?
*  Do you feel like you could feel your way through the world?
*  This I like, this I don't like.
*  Like kind of sensing things.
*  It seems to me that you are able to detect things, people, experiences with a lot of texture.
*  It's hard for me to think outside myself.
*  That's the way I think.
*  I don't know any other way.
*  I'm not a therapist, but I'm just reflecting on creatives that I know and you seem to fall
*  into this category of like things affect you or have the potential to affect you.
*  And so your nervous system is tuned to observe and to absorb.
*  Fortunately, you have a selective filter there because it can't be bombarded by life or stuck
*  there.
*  But do you recall being a kid and like you have visual and emotional memories of things
*  that are strong?
*  Yes.
*  I think I'm very sensitive.
*  I think I get, I'm ticklish.
*  You know, it's, I think with my heart as much as I think with my brain.
*  I really think so.
*  I am, you know, I want to think I have thick skin.
*  I don't.
*  I get hurt easily.
*  I have empathy.
*  It happens to me often that I remember walking in New York.
*  I cry easily.
*  And I saw just a person crying.
*  But I could feel their pain.
*  I don't know this person.
*  I start crying.
*  And I think, you know, a big part of why I love being a magician is because I'm a part
*  of a family that I will not replace with any other family.
*  Like my best friends, John Graham, Shimshi, Blaine, Doug McKenzie.
*  These are very important people in my life.
*  And I'm moved by the fact that, you know, I wanted to do a couple of card tricks.
*  I wanted to do magic.
*  But I got something really, really, really, it's a family.
*  I've joined a family.
*  Juan, who I talked and called a million times, I feel like, you know, what a privilege.
*  This master gave me so many gifts, taught me so many things for no other reason than
*  wanting to share something with me.
*  I'm in awe of that.
*  And it reminds me that I now need to do it with other people.
*  So when we did Inner Circle, we grew a family.
*  There's a bunch of kids, you know, Jacob, Danny, Luke.
*  You remember their names.
*  Yes, I do.
*  Charlie, Struth, Ari.
*  There's a bunch.
*  And we became a family.
*  I remember that I got an award from the Magic Castle, which is a flattering thing.
*  And you spoke about awards.
*  I appreciate awards, but I think awards could be very deceiving.
*  So immediately when I got my award, I got Magician of the Year, which is very flattering.
*  I looked at it for exactly 10 minutes.
*  I closed it and I gave it to somebody.
*  I did not want to own it.
*  But here's the story that I'm trying to tell you here is that, so I had to fly from New
*  York to Los Angeles to receive the award.
*  And one of the kids said, can I join you?
*  Sure, but you have to buy your own ticket and, you know, Airbnb, whatever.
*  And then another one.
*  And all of them came with me.
*  All of them to see me get an award.
*  And I remember the award became secondary to the fact that they came to see me get an
*  award.
*  So we went to get coffee and I took them to the Magic Castle for the first time.
*  I made them perform.
*  We went downstairs to the basement.
*  I said, you're performing now.
*  And it was a highlight for them.
*  And that was my award.
*  It's so interesting because once again, it's the story of the experience as opposed to
*  the end product of the experience that is what captures us.
*  And it's clearly how we embed memory and how we come up with concepts of self in our life
*  arc.
*  It's really beautiful.
*  In your case, it's about magic and mentalist work, but it clearly exports to all domains
*  of life.
*  Certain people are getting it, to put it that way.
*  Speaking of the arc of life, tell us what's coming next.
*  What's the next act?
*  What's the next, I don't want to call it a trick because it diminishes from your craft,
*  from your art.
*  What excites you most these days about what's coming next in your professional life?
*  So I'm now just about to debut my next show, which is Incredibly Human.
*  I'm super excited about this show because in a strange way, that show is this conversation
*  we just had.
*  It's about the human mind.
*  It's about what we can do.
*  It's about pushing limits.
*  It's about kind of proving to ourselves of how magnificent we are.
*  So that, it's very different than my first show Inner Circle because this one is in theaters.
*  It's in a thousand some seats, you know, theaters.
*  What I wanted this show to be visual.
*  I want to have a painterly quality to it.
*  So there's lots of things that are just going to paint the stage with lots of things.
*  I don't want to spoil anything, but it is a tribute to the human mind.
*  I'm excited about doing it.
*  We have so far announced six dates and there's two more big things coming up that I cannot
*  talk about that are very exciting, but they're brewing slowly.
*  But for me right now, this show that I'm about to do is the most exciting thing.
*  Figuring out how to make the best version of that show.
*  Fantastic.
*  Well, Asi, I want to say on behalf of myself and everyone listening and watching, you are
*  a truly unique and spectacular individual.
*  Thank you.
*  Both for the work that you do and the way you approach it, but also for what you teach
*  us about ourselves, about the human mind and brain, about what makes us tick.
*  Indeed, what's possible in us.
*  I was just ringing over and over again in my head that what you do is less about showing
*  what's possible in the world.
*  A card can do this or that.
*  It's about what's possible inside of us, both alone and in groups and as it relates to perception
*  and imagination.
*  It's really, truly spectacular.
*  And I say that having, again, seen you do your acts live and seeing some online and
*  I'll certainly come out to the upcoming show and the mystery shows that I'm not allowed
*  to know about.
*  I also would be remiss if I didn't say that this empathy that you have and the fact that
*  you, as you described it, you think with your heart.
*  I don't know much about your life aside from what you've told us here today, but I imagine
*  that can be a challenging experience at times to live life that way, that sensitivity.
*  I just want to say thank you.
*  We are all gifted this magic, true magic that you do because of the way that you think with
*  your heart and your empathy and your openness and willingness to share.
*  While you did not reveal how every trick is done, you made it very clear that to do so
*  would be to erase some of what's possible in us.
*  And so I also place great value on the fact that you've kept some of the mystery or let's
*  say much of the mystery of magic and mentalist work a secret to us so that we can have it
*  revealed to us in real time through your shows and other venues for magic and mentalist work.
*  So on behalf of myself and everyone listening, I just want to extend an enormous debt of
*  gratitude for what you do and for being you.
*  Thank you so much.
*  It means a lot.
*  Thanks.
