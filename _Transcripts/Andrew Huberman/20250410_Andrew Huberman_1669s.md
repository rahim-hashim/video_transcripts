Video Description: In this Huberman Lab Essentials episode, I discuss how to build muscle strength and size (hypertrophy) and cover key training principles to enhance athletic performance and offset age-related muscle decline.

I explain how the nervous system drives muscle movement, the key differences between training for hypertrophy or strength, and resistance training protocols to build muscle for performance and healthy aging. Additionally, I discuss tools for assessing recovery and the role of key nutrients—such as creatine and electrolytes—in supporting muscle development and performance. This episode provides actionable, science-backed strategies to enhance movement, preserve strength with age, and boost energy levels.

# Build Muscle Size, Increase Strength & Improve Recovery | Huberman Lab Essentials
**Andrew Huberman:** [April 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw)
*  Welcome to Huberman Lab Essentials, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=0.0s)]
*  where we revisit past episodes [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=2.44s)]
*  for the most potent and actionable science-based tools [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=4.48s)]
*  for mental health, physical health, and performance. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=7.66s)]
*  I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=11.8s)]
*  and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=14.56s)]
*  This podcast is separate from my teaching [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=17.72s)]
*  and research roles at Stanford. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=19.48s)]
*  It is, however, part of my desire and effort [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=21.28s)]
*  to bring zero cost to consumer information [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  about science and science-related tools [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=25.48s)]
*  to the general public. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=27.6s)]
*  Today, I want to talk about something [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=29.38s)]
*  that is vitally important for not just athletic performance, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=31.14s)]
*  but for your entire life and indeed for your longevity, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=35.1s)]
*  and that's muscle. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=38.86s)]
*  And one of the things that's exquisite and fantastic [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=40.58s)]
*  about the human brain is that it can direct [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=44.06s)]
*  all sorts of different kinds of movement, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=46.64s)]
*  different speeds of movement, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=49.22s)]
*  movement of different durations. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=51.14s)]
*  All of that is governed by the relationship [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=53.620000000000005s)]
*  between the nervous system, neurons, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=57.48s)]
*  and their connections to muscle. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=60.12s)]
*  So today, as always, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=62.8s)]
*  we're going to talk a little bit of mechanism. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=64.12s)]
*  I'm going to explain how neurons control muscle. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=66.56s)]
*  We will touch on some nutritional themes [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=69.67999999999999s)]
*  and how that relates to muscle, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=72.16s)]
*  in particular, a specific amino acid [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=73.32s)]
*  that if it's available in your bloodstream frequently enough [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=75.72s)]
*  and at sufficient levels, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=79.12s)]
*  can help you build and improve the quality of muscle. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=81.03999999999999s)]
*  We are also going to talk about recovery. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=85.5s)]
*  That's when muscle grows, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=88.1s)]
*  that's when muscle gets more flexible. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=89.46s)]
*  None of that actually happens during training, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=91.86s)]
*  it happens after training. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=93.98s)]
*  Most people, when they hear the word muscle, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=95.78s)]
*  they just think about strength. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=97.94s)]
*  But of course, muscles are involved [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=99.7s)]
*  in everything that we do. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=101.34s)]
*  They are involved in speaking, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=103.34s)]
*  they are involved in sitting and standing up, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=104.53999999999999s)]
*  they are involved in lifting objects, including ourselves. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=106.56s)]
*  They are absolutely essential [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=110.42s)]
*  for maintaining how we breathe. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=113.26s)]
*  They're absolutely essential for ambulation, for moving, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=115.54s)]
*  and for skills of any kind. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=119.26s)]
*  So when we think about muscle, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=122.18s)]
*  we don't just want to think about muscle, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=124.46000000000001s)]
*  the meat that is muscle, but what controls that muscle. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=126.66000000000001s)]
*  And no surprise, what controls muscle is the nervous system. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=130.52s)]
*  The nervous system does that [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=135.26s)]
*  through three main nodes of control. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=136.8s)]
*  Basically, we have upper motor neurons in our motor cortex. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=139.54000000000002s)]
*  So those are in our skull, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=142.98s)]
*  and those are involved in deliberate movement. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=144.89999999999998s)]
*  Those upper motor neurons send signals [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=147.01999999999998s)]
*  down to my spinal cord, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=149.01999999999998s)]
*  where there are two categories of neurons. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=150.38s)]
*  One are the lower motor neurons, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=153.1s)]
*  and those lower motor neurons send little wires [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=155.94s)]
*  that we call axons out to our muscles, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=158.94s)]
*  and cause those muscles to contract. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=161.7s)]
*  They do that by dumping chemicals onto the muscle. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=163.44s)]
*  In fact, the chemical is acetylcholine. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=165.7s)]
*  Now, there's another category of neurons [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=168.88s)]
*  in the spinal cord called central pattern generators, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=171.26s)]
*  or CPGs, and those are involved in rhythmic movements. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=173.5s)]
*  Anytime we're walking or doing something [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=177.57999999999998s)]
*  where we don't have to think about it to do it deliberately, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=179.62s)]
*  it's just happening reflexively, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=182.85999999999999s)]
*  that central pattern generators and motor neurons. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=184.48s)]
*  Anytime we're doing something deliberately, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=186.94s)]
*  that the top-down control, as we call it, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=189.1s)]
*  from the upper motor neurons comes in [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=191.66s)]
*  and takes control of that system. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=193.57999999999998s)]
*  So it's really simple. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=195.7s)]
*  You've only got three ingredients. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=196.51999999999998s)]
*  You've got the upper motor neurons, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=197.78s)]
*  the lower motor neurons, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=198.84s)]
*  and for rhythmic movements that are reflexive, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=199.86s)]
*  you've also got the central pattern generators. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=201.98000000000002s)]
*  I'd now like to shift our attention [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=204.38000000000002s)]
*  to how to use specific aspects of muscular contraction [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=205.86s)]
*  to improve muscle hypertrophy, muscle growth, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=210.04000000000002s)]
*  as well as improving muscle strength. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=213.14000000000001s)]
*  There are a lot of reasons to want to get stronger, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=215.98000000000002s)]
*  and I should just mention that it's not always the case [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=218.22000000000003s)]
*  that getting stronger involves muscles getting bigger. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=222.02s)]
*  There are ways for muscles to get stronger [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=224.96s)]
*  without getting bigger. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=227.02s)]
*  However, increasing the size of a muscle [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=228.96s)]
*  almost inevitably increases the strength of that muscle, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=231.92s)]
*  at least to some degree. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=235.07999999999998s)]
*  Reasons why most everyone should want [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=236.85999999999999s)]
*  to get their muscles stronger [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=239.38s)]
*  is that muscles are generally getting progressively weaker [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=240.96s)]
*  across the lifespan. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=244.74s)]
*  So when I say getting stronger, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=246.35999999999999s)]
*  it's not necessarily about being able to move [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=247.57999999999998s)]
*  increasing amounts of weight in the gym, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=250.6s)]
*  but rather to offset some of the normal decline [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=253.51999999999998s)]
*  in strength and posture and the ability to generate [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=257.66s)]
*  a large range of movement safely that occurs as we age. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=261.3s)]
*  So there's an important principle of muscle physiology [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=264.86s)]
*  called the Henneman-size principle. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=267.44s)]
*  And the Henneman-size principle essentially says [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=269.78000000000003s)]
*  that we recruit what are called motor units. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=272.38000000000005s)]
*  Motor units are just the connections between nerve and muscle [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=277.08000000000004s)]
*  from in a pattern that staircases [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=281.5s)]
*  from low threshold to high threshold. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=284.38s)]
*  What this means is when you pick up something that is light, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=287.26s)]
*  you're going to use the minimum amount of nerve [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=291.86s)]
*  to muscle energy in order to move that thing. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=294.34s)]
*  Likewise, when you pick up an object that's heavy, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=297.08s)]
*  you're going to use the minimum amount of nerve [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=300.76s)]
*  to muscle connectivity and energy [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=303.18s)]
*  in order to move that object. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=305.26s)]
*  So it's basically a conservation of energy principle. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=307.8s)]
*  Now, if you continue to exert effort of movement, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=311.82s)]
*  what will happen is you will tend to recruit more [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=316.42s)]
*  and more motor units with time. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=319.22s)]
*  As you recruit more and more of these motor units, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=322.14000000000004s)]
*  these connections between these lower motor neurons [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=325.5s)]
*  and muscle, that's when you start to get changes [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=327.62s)]
*  in the muscle. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=331.26s)]
*  That's when you open the gate for the potential [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=332.40000000000003s)]
*  for the muscles to get stronger and to get larger. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=335.66s)]
*  And so the way this process works [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=338.58000000000004s)]
*  has been badly misunderstood in the kind of online literature [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=341.46000000000004s)]
*  of weight training and bodybuilding [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=345.82s)]
*  and even in sports physiology. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=347.54s)]
*  The Henneman size principle is kind of a foundational [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=349.58s)]
*  principle within muscle physiology. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=353.65999999999997s)]
*  But many people have come to interpret it by saying [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=355.96s)]
*  that the way to recruit high threshold motor units, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=359.65999999999997s)]
*  the ones that are hard to get to, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=363.2s)]
*  is to just use heavy weights. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=364.74s)]
*  And that's actually not the case. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=367.26s)]
*  As we'll talk about, the research supports that weights [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=369.46s)]
*  in a very large range of sort of a percentage [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=372.52s)]
*  of your maximum, anywhere from 30 to 80%. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=377.52s)]
*  So weights that are not very light, but are moderately light [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=381.68s)]
*  too heavy can cause changes in the connections [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=385.64s)]
*  between nerve and muscle that lead to muscle strength [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=389.2s)]
*  and muscle hypertrophy. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=392.28s)]
*  Put differently, heavy weights can help build muscle [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=394.0s)]
*  and strength, but they are not required. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=398.76s)]
*  What one has to do is adhere to a certain number [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=401.36s)]
*  of parameters, just a couple of key variables [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=404.04s)]
*  that I'll spell out for you. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=406.68s)]
*  And if you do that, you can greatly increase [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=407.96000000000004s)]
*  muscle hypertrophy, muscle size, and or muscle strength, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=411.40000000000003s)]
*  if that's what you want to do. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=415.40000000000003s)]
*  And you don't necessarily have to use heavy weights [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=417.28000000000003s)]
*  in order to do that. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=420.16s)]
*  Now, I'm sure the power lifters and the people [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=421.24s)]
*  that like to move heavy weights around will say, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=423.8s)]
*  no, if you want to get strong, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=426.56s)]
*  you absolutely have to live heavy weights. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=427.96000000000004s)]
*  And that might be true if you want to get very strong, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=430.08s)]
*  but for most people who are interested [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=433.09999999999997s)]
*  in supporting their muscular such that they offset [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=435.32s)]
*  any age-related decline in strength [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=438.78s)]
*  or an increasing hypertrophy and strength to some degree, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=441.44s)]
*  there really isn't a need to use the heaviest weights [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=445.65999999999997s)]
*  possible in order to build strength and muscle. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=448.08s)]
*  So there are three major stimuli for changing the way [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=450.03999999999996s)]
*  that muscle works and making muscles stronger, larger, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=453.56s)]
*  or better in some way. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=457.52s)]
*  And those are stress, tension, and damage. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=459.24s)]
*  Those three things don't necessarily all have to be present, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=464.62s)]
*  but stress of some kind has to exist. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=468.08s)]
*  So this is very reminiscent of neuroplasticity in the brain. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=470.44s)]
*  There is a good predictor of how well [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=473.36s)]
*  or how efficient you will be in building the strength [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=477.04s)]
*  and or if you like the size of a given muscle. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=480.16s)]
*  And it has everything to do with those upper motor neurons [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=483.76s)]
*  that are involved in deliberate control of muscle. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=486.38s)]
*  You can actually do this test right now. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=488.8s)]
*  You can just kind of march across your body mentally [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=491.0s)]
*  and see whether or not you can independently contract [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=494.2s)]
*  any or all of your muscles. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=497.96000000000004s)]
*  Because everything about muscle hypertrophy, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=499.96000000000004s)]
*  about stimulating muscle growth [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=503.64s)]
*  is about generating isolated contractions, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=506.32s)]
*  about challenging specific muscles in a very unnatural way. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=509.72s)]
*  Whereas with strength, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=515.76s)]
*  it's about using musculature as a system, moving weights, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=517.08s)]
*  moving resistance, moving the body. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=520.96s)]
*  The specific goal of hypertrophy is to isolate [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=523.96s)]
*  specific nerve to muscle pathways [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=527.62s)]
*  so that you stimulate the chemical [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=529.72s)]
*  and signaling transduction events in muscles [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=531.8000000000001s)]
*  so that those muscles respond by getting larger. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=533.96s)]
*  So there's a critical distinction [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=536.8000000000001s)]
*  in terms of getting stronger [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=538.48s)]
*  versus trying to get muscles to be larger, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=540.24s)]
*  hypertrophy per se. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=543.4000000000001s)]
*  And it has to do with how much you isolate those muscles. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=545.28s)]
*  So you can nest this as a principle for yourself, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=548.98s)]
*  which is if you want to get stronger, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=552.52s)]
*  it's really about moving progressively greater loads [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=554.56s)]
*  or increasing the amount of weight that you move. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=558.3199999999999s)]
*  Whereas if you're specifically interested [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=560.88s)]
*  in generating hypertrophy, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=563.02s)]
*  it's all about trying to generate those really hard, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=565.3399999999999s)]
*  almost painful localized contractions of muscle. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=568.56s)]
*  If ever there was an area of practical science [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=571.74s)]
*  that was very confused, very controversial [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=574.18s)]
*  and almost combative at times, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=577.62s)]
*  it would be this issue of how best to train. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=579.8599999999999s)]
*  I suppose the only thing that's even more barbed wire [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=582.5799999999999s)]
*  of a conversation than that is how best to eat for health. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=585.3s)]
*  Those seem to be the two most common areas of online battle. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=588.38s)]
*  What's very clear now from all the literature [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=593.26s)]
*  is that once you know roughly your one repetition maximum, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=596.42s)]
*  the maximum amount of weight that you can perform [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=602.14s)]
*  an exercise with for one repetition in good form, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=605.7199999999999s)]
*  full range of motion, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=608.9399999999999s)]
*  that it's very clear that moving weights [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=611.14s)]
*  or using bands or using body weight, for instance, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=615.54s)]
*  in the 30 to 80% of one rep maximum, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=620.3399999999999s)]
*  that is going to be the most beneficial range [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=623.9399999999999s)]
*  in terms of muscle hypertrophy and strength. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=626.62s)]
*  So muscle growth and strength. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=628.8399999999999s)]
*  So let's say you're somebody who's been doing [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=630.34s)]
*  some resistance exercise kind of on and off over the years [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=632.24s)]
*  and you decide you want to get serious about that [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=636.74s)]
*  for sake of sport or offsetting age related declines [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=638.5s)]
*  in strength, the range of sets to do [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=641.14s)]
*  in order to improve strength ranges anywhere from two, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=645.22s)]
*  believe it or not, to 20 per week. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=648.82s)]
*  Again, these are sets per week [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=651.1800000000001s)]
*  and they don't necessarily all have to be performed [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=652.7s)]
*  in the same weight training session. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=655.12s)]
*  It appears that five sets per week [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=656.74s)]
*  in this 30% to 80% of the one repetition maximum range [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=659.94s)]
*  is what's required just to maintain your muscle. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=664.32s)]
*  So think about that. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=666.82s)]
*  If you're somebody who's kind of a verse [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=667.74s)]
*  to resistance training, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=669.12s)]
*  you are going to lose muscle size and strength. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=670.42s)]
*  Your metabolism will drop, your posture will get worse. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=673.26s)]
*  Everything in the context of nerve to muscle connectivity [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=676.02s)]
*  will get worse over time [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=679.14s)]
*  unless you are generating five sets [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=681.74s)]
*  or more of this 30% to 80% [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=685.88s)]
*  of your one repetition maximum per week. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=689.02s)]
*  Okay, so what this means is for the typical person [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=691.6999999999999s)]
*  who hasn't done a lot of weight training, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=694.26s)]
*  you need to do at least five sets per muscle group. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=695.68s)]
*  Now that's just to maintain. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=699.4399999999999s)]
*  And then there's this huge range [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=701.3399999999999s)]
*  that goes all the way up to 15 [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=702.98s)]
*  and in some case, 20 sets per week. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=704.3s)]
*  Now, how many sets you perform [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=706.56s)]
*  is going to depend on the intensity [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=708.74s)]
*  of the work that you perform. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=711.1800000000001s)]
*  This is where it gets a little bit controversial [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=712.98s)]
*  but I think nowadays most people agree [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=715.0600000000001s)]
*  that 10% of the sets of a given workout [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=717.92s)]
*  or 10% of workouts overall should be [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=724.1s)]
*  of the high intensity sort [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=727.42s)]
*  where one is actually working to muscular failure. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=729.08s)]
*  But the point being that most of your training, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=731.66s)]
*  most of your sets should be not to failure. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=734.76s)]
*  And the reason for that is it allows you [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=738.9s)]
*  to do more volume of work. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=740.84s)]
*  So we can make this simple, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=743.84s)]
*  perform anywhere from five to 15 sets [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=746.04s)]
*  of resistance exercise per week. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=749.2s)]
*  And that's per muscle. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=752.42s)]
*  And that's in this 30 to 80% [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=754.6s)]
*  of what your one repetition maximum. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=756.92s)]
*  That seems to be the most scientifically supported way [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=758.64s)]
*  of offsetting any decline in muscle strength. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=761.96s)]
*  If you're working in the kind of five set range [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=765.6800000000001s)]
*  and in increasing muscle strength [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=767.6800000000001s)]
*  when you start to get up into the 10 and 15 set range. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=770.48s)]
*  But it's pretty clear that performing this five [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=773.6800000000001s)]
*  to 15 sets per week, whether or not it's in one workout [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=776.2s)]
*  or whether that's divided up across multiple workouts [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=779.22s)]
*  is really what's going to be most beneficial. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=781.52s)]
*  And please do keep in mind Henneman's size principle [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=783.08s)]
*  and the recruitment of motor units. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=786.32s)]
*  And remember the better you are [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=787.62s)]
*  at contracting particular muscles [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=789.24s)]
*  and isolating those muscles, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=790.72s)]
*  the fewer sets likely you need to do [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=792.26s)]
*  in order to get the desired effect. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=794.4200000000001s)]
*  What about people who have been training for a while? [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=796.28s)]
*  If you're somebody who's been doing [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=798.34s)]
*  weight training for a while, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=799.6s)]
*  the data point to the fact that more volume [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=801.8000000000001s)]
*  can be beneficial even for muscles [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=804.86s)]
*  that you are very efficient at contracting. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=806.8000000000001s)]
*  Now the curve on this, the graph on this [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=810.08s)]
*  begins again at about five sets per week [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=813.32s)]
*  for maintaining a given muscle group [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=815.72s)]
*  and extends all the way out to 25 or 30 sets per week. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=817.44s)]
*  However, there are individuals who for whatever reason [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=822.0400000000001s)]
*  can generate so much force. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=826.6s)]
*  They're so good at training muscles [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=828.1800000000001s)]
*  that they can generate so much force [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=830.8000000000001s)]
*  in just four or six or eight sets [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=832.5200000000001s)]
*  that doing this large volume of work [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=835.6400000000001s)]
*  is actually going to be counterproductive. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=837.3800000000001s)]
*  So everyone needs to figure out for themselves, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=839.5600000000001s)]
*  first of all, how often you're willing [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=842.12s)]
*  to do resistance exercise of any kind. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=843.6s)]
*  And then it does appear that somewhere between [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=846.02s)]
*  five and 15 sets per week is going to be [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=848.22s)]
*  what's the thing that's going to work for most people. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=852.3s)]
*  Now this is based on a tremendous amount of work [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=854.5799999999999s)]
*  that was done by Andy Galpin and colleagues, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=856.62s)]
*  Brad Schoenfield and colleagues, Mike Roberts. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=858.42s)]
*  There's a huge group of people out there [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=861.06s)]
*  doing exercise physiology and a small subset of them [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=863.5s)]
*  that are linking them back to real world protocols [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=866.8199999999999s)]
*  that don't just pertain to athletes. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=869.72s)]
*  So that's mainly what I'm focusing on today. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=871.66s)]
*  And surely there will be exceptions. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=873.46s)]
*  Now, if you are going to divide the sets across the week, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=875.66s)]
*  you're not going to do all 10 sets, for instance, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=879.98s)]
*  for a given muscle group in one session, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=882.02s)]
*  then of course it's imperative that the muscles recover [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=884.02s)]
*  in between sessions. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=886.8199999999999s)]
*  You might ask, well, what about the speeds of movements? [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=887.76s)]
*  This is actually turns out to be [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=890.6999999999999s)]
*  a really interesting data set. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=891.78s)]
*  For generating explosiveness and speed, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=894.02s)]
*  it's very clear that learning to generate forces quickly [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=897.42s)]
*  and to move heavy or moderately heavy loads quickly [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=900.9s)]
*  is going to be beneficial because of the way [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=904.76s)]
*  that you train the motor neurons. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=906.56s)]
*  And of course changes in the muscle. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=908.96s)]
*  And so what this would involve is something like 60 to 75% [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=910.88s)]
*  of a one repetition maximum. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=914.8s)]
*  And then in a controlled way, moving that as quickly [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=916.16s)]
*  as one can throughout the entire set [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=919.12s)]
*  and certainly not going to failure. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=921.48s)]
*  Because as you approach failure, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=923.62s)]
*  the inability to move the weight with good form, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=925.12s)]
*  the weight inevitably slows down. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=927.3199999999999s)]
*  So as you're probably starting to realize, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=929.52s)]
*  you need to customize a resistance practice [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=931.04s)]
*  for your particular needs and goals. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=934.8399999999999s)]
*  So we've talked about a few principles. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=936.9s)]
*  The fact that you need to get sufficient volume, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=938.36s)]
*  you need at least five sets to maintain [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=940.28s)]
*  and you probably need about 10 sets per muscle group [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=941.92s)]
*  in order to improve muscle. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=944.04s)]
*  That moving weights of moderate to moderately heavy weight [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=945.86s)]
*  quickly is going to be best for explosiveness. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=949.16s)]
*  That isolating muscles and really contracting muscles hard, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=951.12s)]
*  something that you can test by just [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=954.88s)]
*  when you're outside the training session, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=956.92s)]
*  sooner or later you can cramp the muscle hard, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=958.64s)]
*  will really, will tell you your capacity [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=960.1s)]
*  to improve hypertrophy or to engage strength changes [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=963.66s)]
*  in that muscle. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=967.3000000000001s)]
*  That your ability to contract a muscle hard [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=968.5400000000001s)]
*  is inversely related to the number of sets [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=971.3000000000001s)]
*  that you should do in order to isolate [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=973.6800000000001s)]
*  and stimulate that muscle. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=975.78s)]
*  Now, how long to recover between sets? [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=977.7s)]
*  There's a question for the testosterone protocol. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=979.7s)]
*  Duncan French and colleagues found that it was [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=982.1800000000001s)]
*  about two minutes, keeping that really on the clock, [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=983.78s)]
*  two minutes, not longer. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=986.1s)]
*  For hypertrophy and for strength gains, [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=988.18s)]
*  it does seem that resting anywhere from two minutes [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=990.6999999999999s)]
*  or even three or four or even five or six minutes [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=993.38s)]
*  can be beneficial. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=996.7399999999999s)]
*  So how do we know if we've recovered? [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=997.8199999999999s)]
*  How can we test recovery? [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=999.3199999999999s)]
*  And this is not just recovery from resistance training, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1000.9399999999999s)]
*  this is recovery from running, recovery from swimming. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1003.3s)]
*  Up until now, I've been talking about resistance training [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1006.62s)]
*  more or less in a vacuum. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1008.5799999999999s)]
*  I haven't even touched on the fact that many people [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1010.06s)]
*  are running and they're doing resistance training [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1012.68s)]
*  or they're swimming and they're doing resistance training. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1014.78s)]
*  Well, you can assess systemic recovery, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1017.22s)]
*  meaning your nervous system and your nervous system's [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1020.74s)]
*  ability to generate force, both distributed and isolated, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1023.94s)]
*  through three main tests. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1028.1000000000001s)]
*  And fortunately, these tests are very simple [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1030.44s)]
*  and two of them are essentially zero cost, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1033.42s)]
*  require no equipment. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1036.6000000000001s)]
*  HRV, heart rate variability, has made its way finally [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1039.02s)]
*  into the forefront of exercise physiology [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1043.82s)]
*  and even into the popular discussion. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1046.38s)]
*  I've talked about HRV before, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1048.5400000000002s)]
*  how when we exhale, our heart rate slows down [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1050.46s)]
*  because of the way that our diaphragm is connected [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1052.6000000000001s)]
*  to our heart and to our brain [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1054.3200000000002s)]
*  and the way our brain is connected to our heart. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1055.6200000000001s)]
*  When we inhale, our heart rate speeds up [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1057.3000000000002s)]
*  and that is the basis of heart rate variability. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1059.8200000000002s)]
*  Heart rate variability is good, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1062.42s)]
*  but heart rate variability is difficult [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1065.0400000000002s)]
*  for a lot of people to measure. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1067.0200000000002s)]
*  There are two measures, however, [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1068.3400000000001s)]
*  whether or not you recovered, [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1069.6200000000001s)]
*  that you can use first thing in the morning when you wake up [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1070.7800000000002s)]
*  in order to assess how well recovered you are [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1073.9s)]
*  and therefore whether or not you should train [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1076.6200000000001s)]
*  your whole system at all that day. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1078.5800000000002s)]
*  The first one is grip strength. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1080.9s)]
*  Grip strength, the ability to generate force [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1084.18s)]
*  at the level of squeezing the fist [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1087.3400000000001s)]
*  or squeezing down on something, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1089.1000000000001s)]
*  might seem like kind of a trivial way to assess recovery, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1091.3600000000001s)]
*  but it's not because it relates to your ability [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1094.42s)]
*  to use your upper motor neurons [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1097.02s)]
*  to control your lower motor neurons [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1098.5800000000002s)]
*  and to generate isolated force. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1100.14s)]
*  And so that's really what you're assessing when you do that. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1102.58s)]
*  Some people will use one of these grip tools. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1105.4199999999998s)]
*  If I've been working really hard, not sleeping very well, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1109.3799999999999s)]
*  or I've been training a lot, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1111.9399999999998s)]
*  any one or combination of those things, my grip suffers. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1113.04s)]
*  I can't actually squeeze that thing down as much as I can, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1115.82s)]
*  but on a good day, I can squeeze this thing [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1118.3s)]
*  so that I eliminate the hole in the donut, so to speak. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1119.8999999999999s)]
*  You can also take a floor scale and squeeze the scale [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1122.5s)]
*  and see how much force you can generate. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1125.82s)]
*  I would do that as a baseline to establish [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1127.8999999999999s)]
*  what you can do when you're well rested [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1130.26s)]
*  and then if you do that in the morning, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1132.42s)]
*  you can see whether or not you're able to generate [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1133.64s)]
*  the same amount of force. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1135.5600000000002s)]
*  A lot of this is very subjective with the scale. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1136.8200000000002s)]
*  You're really trying to assess whether or not [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1139.22s)]
*  you can generate the same amount of force. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1140.66s)]
*  If you start seeing a 10% or 20%, [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1142.54s)]
*  certainly reduction in that, that's concerning. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1144.78s)]
*  It means that your nervous system as a whole, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1147.3000000000002s)]
*  it's not necessarily fatigued, [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1150.66s)]
*  it's that the pathways from nerve to muscle [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1152.88s)]
*  are still in the process of rewiring themselves [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1155.94s)]
*  in order to generate force. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1158.6200000000001s)]
*  And you might think, well, I trained one muscle group, [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1160.18s)]
*  one day, why am I having a hard time doing this [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1162.28s)]
*  for a completely different muscle group? [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1164.04s)]
*  Doesn't make any sense. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1165.6399999999999s)]
*  But there's something about the upper motor neuron [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1166.8s)]
*  to lower motor neuron pathway generally [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1168.8999999999999s)]
*  that allows you to use something like grip strength [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1171.48s)]
*  as a kind of a thermometer, if you will, [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1173.84s)]
*  of your ability to recover. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1177.24s)]
*  So look for your ability to generate force in grip [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1178.56s)]
*  when you first wake up. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1181.0s)]
*  It's not going to be as good as it is at 3 p.m. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1182.28s)]
*  after a cup of coffee and a couple meals, [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1184.8s)]
*  but the point isn't performance overall. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1187.18s)]
*  The point is to assess whether or not [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1190.1s)]
*  you're getting better, worse or the same from day to day. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1191.52s)]
*  The other one that's really terrific [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1194.6399999999999s)]
*  is carbon dioxide tolerance. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1196.06s)]
*  So this is a really interesting tool [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1198.04s)]
*  that endurance athletes, strength athletes, [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1199.8s)]
*  I think can all benefit from. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1202.82s)]
*  So here's how you do the carbon dioxide tolerance test. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1204.28s)]
*  You wake up in the morning and what you're going to do [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1206.94s)]
*  is you're going to inhale through your nose [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1209.0s)]
*  as deeply as you can. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1210.96s)]
*  You can do this lying down, sitting, whatever. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1212.12s)]
*  Inhale through your nose and then exhale all the way. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1215.58s)]
*  So that's one. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1220.28s)]
*  You're going to repeat that four times. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1221.16s)]
*  Then you take a fifth inhale as deep as you can [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1223.8200000000002s)]
*  through your nose. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1227.0600000000002s)]
*  Fill your lungs as much as you can. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1227.9s)]
*  And if you can try and expand, [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1229.88s)]
*  make your stomach go out while you do that, [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1232.76s)]
*  that means that your diaphragm is really engaged. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1234.3600000000001s)]
*  So you're inhaling as much as you possibly can. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1236.48s)]
*  Then hit the timer and your goal is to release that air [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1239.5400000000002s)]
*  as slowly as possible through your mouth. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1243.94s)]
*  So it looks like you have a tiny, tiny little straw [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1247.4s)]
*  in your mouth and you're letting it go [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1250.0s)]
*  as slowly as you possibly can. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1254.8s)]
*  Measure what we call the carbon dioxide blow off time [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1257.44s)]
*  or discard rate. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1261.16s)]
*  I know you can all sit with lungs empty [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1264.2s)]
*  after you eliminate all that air, but don't lie to yourself. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1266.16s)]
*  Don't stop the timer when you've been sitting [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1270.36s)]
*  with your lungs empty for a while. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1273.04s)]
*  Stop the timer when you are finally no longer able [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1274.56s)]
*  to exhale any more air. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1278.28s)]
*  Your carbon dioxide discard rate will be somewhere [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1280.5s)]
*  between one second and presumably two minutes. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1284.84s)]
*  Two minutes would be a heroic carbon dioxide discard time. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1289.32s)]
*  30 seconds would be more typical. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1293.3999999999999s)]
*  20 seconds would be fast. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1295.3999999999999s)]
*  If your carbon dioxide discard time is 20 or 25 seconds [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1297.76s)]
*  or less, you are not necessarily recovered [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1303.76s)]
*  from your previous day's activities. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1308.56s)]
*  If your carbon dioxide discard time is somewhere [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1310.92s)]
*  between about 30 seconds and 60 seconds, [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1313.64s)]
*  you are in what we would call kind of the green zone [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1319.0s)]
*  where you are in a position to do more physical work. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1322.56s)]
*  And if your carbon dioxide discard time is somewhere [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1327.8s)]
*  between 65 and 120 seconds, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1330.32s)]
*  well then you have almost certainly recovered [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1334.24s)]
*  your nervous system. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1337.8s)]
*  I'm not talking about the individual muscles, [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1338.9199999999998s)]
*  but your nervous system is prepared to do more work. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1340.36s)]
*  I'm really keen on this tool [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1343.6s)]
*  because everybody has different recovery abilities. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1345.0s)]
*  I realize people have varying levels of stress [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1348.0s)]
*  and demand in their life. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1349.76s)]
*  It's just impossible to prescribe an entire protocol [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1351.08s)]
*  that says, okay, yes, you should train today [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1354.96s)]
*  and this is exactly what you should do. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1356.76s)]
*  No, you shouldn't. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1358.0s)]
*  Use carbon dioxide discard rate [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1358.84s)]
*  because A, it's valuable, it's informative. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1360.76s)]
*  B, it's zero cost. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1363.48s)]
*  And C, it's something that you can track objectively [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1366.72s)]
*  over time and that's really the key. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1369.28s)]
*  So recovery is a complex process. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1371.1999999999998s)]
*  It's got a lot of things, [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1373.24s)]
*  but the CO2 tolerance test should be a valuable tool. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1374.6799999999998s)]
*  Now, another tool for recovery [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1377.84s)]
*  that people are very excited about [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1379.48s)]
*  is the use of cold and the ice bath. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1381.1999999999998s)]
*  And this is important. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1383.24s)]
*  Yes, it will reduce inflammation. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1385.28s)]
*  Yes, it will reduce the amount [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1387.2s)]
*  of delayed onset muscle soreness, [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1389.0800000000002s)]
*  but it does seem to interfere [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1391.16s)]
*  with some of the things like mTOR pathways, [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1393.0800000000002s)]
*  the mammalian target erapamycin pathway [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1395.16s)]
*  and other pathways related to inflammation [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1397.28s)]
*  that promote muscle repair and muscle growth. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1400.56s)]
*  Remember, stress, tension and damage are the stimulus [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1403.96s)]
*  for nerve to muscle connections to change [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1407.28s)]
*  and for muscles to get bigger, stronger and better. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1409.28s)]
*  And so if you're getting into the ice bath [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1411.68s)]
*  after doing resistance training, [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1413.92s)]
*  you are likely short-circuiting the improvements [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1415.68s)]
*  that you're trying to create. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1418.3600000000001s)]
*  The other thing are non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1419.88s)]
*  You know their trade names. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1422.5600000000002s)]
*  These are painkillers that many people take. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1423.8s)]
*  Those, as I've mentioned in a previous episode, [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1425.88s)]
*  seem to prevent a lot of the gains, [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1427.72s)]
*  the improvements in endurance, strength and size [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1430.04s)]
*  that people are specifically using exercise for. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1433.0s)]
*  So be cautious about your use [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1436.3200000000002s)]
*  of non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1438.0s)]
*  especially within the four hours preceding [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1440.6000000000001s)]
*  or the four hours following exercise. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1443.16s)]
*  Let's talk about some of the things [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1445.88s)]
*  that seem to work across the board to improve strength, [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1447.24s)]
*  improve hypertrophy and improve nerve to muscle [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1451.52s)]
*  communication and performance. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1455.1200000000001s)]
*  The first thing that's absolutely key [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1456.72s)]
*  for nerve to muscle communication [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1458.68s)]
*  and physical performance of any kind, [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1460.6000000000001s)]
*  might not sound that exciting to you, [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1463.16s)]
*  but it is very exciting and that's salt. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1464.64s)]
*  Nerves, nerve cells, neurons, communicate with each other [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1468.52s)]
*  and communicate with muscle by electricity. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1472.56s)]
*  But that electricity is generated by particular ions [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1475.84s)]
*  moving into and out of the neuron [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1479.1599999999999s)]
*  and the rushing in of a particular ion, sodium, salt, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1481.1599999999999s)]
*  is what allows nerve cells to fire. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1486.3999999999999s)]
*  If you don't have enough salt in your system, [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1488.8799999999999s)]
*  your neurons and your brain [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1491.8799999999999s)]
*  and your nerve to muscle communication will be terrible. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1493.28s)]
*  If you have sufficient salt, it will be excellent. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1496.6399999999999s)]
*  How much salt will depend on how much water you're drinking, [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1499.72s)]
*  how much caffeine you're drinking [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1502.32s)]
*  and how much food you're ingesting. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1503.6399999999999s)]
*  So, and whether or not you're taking any diuretics, [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1505.8799999999999s)]
*  how hot it is, et cetera, how much you're sweating. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1507.98s)]
*  So you want to make sure that you have enough salt, [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1510.28s)]
*  potassium and magnesium in your system [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1512.04s)]
*  if you want to perform well. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1514.1599999999999s)]
*  The other thing that's been shown over and over again, [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1515.9399999999998s)]
*  numerous well-controlled studies [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1519.08s)]
*  to improve muscle performance is creatine. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1521.24s)]
*  How much creatine? [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1524.48s)]
*  Well, I asked the experts and they tell me that [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1525.4399999999998s)]
*  for somebody who's about 180 pounds, [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1529.0s)]
*  five grams a day should be sufficient or so. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1532.04s)]
*  Creatine seems to have a performance enhancing effect. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1535.36s)]
*  There are 66 studies, 66, [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1538.48s)]
*  showing that power output is greatly increased, [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1541.3s)]
*  anywhere from 12 to 20%. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1544.8s)]
*  And this is sprinting and running and jumping [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1548.12s)]
*  as well as weightlifting by creatine. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1550.04s)]
*  The ability to hydrate your body is improved by creatine [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1552.58s)]
*  because of the way that it brings more water [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1557.02s)]
*  into cells of various kinds. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1560.04s)]
*  It reduces fatigue. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1562.32s)]
*  When it comes to supporting muscle, [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1563.76s)]
*  it does seem that ingesting 700 to 3000 milligrams [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1567.12s)]
*  of the essential amino acid leucine [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1571.86s)]
*  with each meal is important. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1574.12s)]
*  Now that does not necessarily mean from supplements. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1575.44s)]
*  In fact, most people recommend that you get your protein, [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1578.6399999999999s)]
*  you get your amino acids, [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1583.3999999999999s)]
*  including your essential amino acids [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1584.86s)]
*  and your leucine from whole foods. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1586.62s)]
*  High quality proteins are high density proteins. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1588.4s)]
*  What do you mean by that? [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1592.0s)]
*  Well, it is true that a lot of sources of protein [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1592.8400000000001s)]
*  are found in things like beans and nuts [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1595.98s)]
*  and things like that, [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1598.8400000000001s)]
*  that all the essential amino acids can be found there, [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1599.68s)]
*  but per unit calorie, if it's in your practice, [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1602.5600000000002s)]
*  if it's in your ethics to ingest animal proteins, [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1607.24s)]
*  it's true that for instance, 200 calories of steak [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1609.88s)]
*  or chicken or fish or eggs will have a higher density [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1613.96s)]
*  of essential amino acids than the equivalent amount [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1617.64s)]
*  of calories from nuts or plants. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1620.0400000000002s)]
*  So I'm not for the vegans and vegetarians, [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1622.66s)]
*  I'm certainly not saying there's no way [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1624.44s)]
*  that you can support muscle growth, you absolutely can. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1626.64s)]
*  I encourage you to think about this protein density issue [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1629.64s)]
*  and whether or not you're getting sufficient [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1633.64s)]
*  essential amino acids, especially leucine. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1636.1200000000001s)]
*  But I think the simple takeaway from the literature [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1639.5800000000002s)]
*  that I was able to extract, eating two to four times a day, [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1641.96s)]
*  making sure you're getting sufficient amino acids, [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1644.76s)]
*  in a way that's compatible with your ethics [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1648.3999999999999s)]
*  and with your nutritional regimen [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1649.8999999999999s)]
*  is going to support muscle repair, muscle growth, [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1651.44s)]
*  strength improvements, et cetera, just fine. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1655.24s)]
*  Last but not least, I want to thank you [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1658.04s)]
*  for your time and attention today. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1659.76s)]
*  And as always, thank you for your interest in science. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1661.24s)]
*  ["Science on a Roll"] [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgaoLdS82vw&t=1664.12s)]
