Video Description: In this episode I explain how your vagus nerve—an extensive neural pathway linking your brain and body in both directions—powerfully regulates your mood, digestion, alertness and even certain food cravings, and I explain how you can activate certain vagus nerve pathways to improve your heart rate variability (HRV), a key marker of health and longevity. I also explain how to control vagal pathways to enhance your focus and alertness to improve learning and neuroplasticity. And I explain how your vagus nerve controls levels of serotonin in both your gut and brain, impacting your mood and emotional resilience and how to keep that pathway robust.

# Control Your Vagus Nerve to Improve Mood, Alertness & Neuroplasticity
**Andrew Huberman:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A)
*  Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=0.0s)]
*  where we discuss science [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2.36s)]
*  and science-based tools for everyday life. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  I'm Andrew Huberman, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5.96s)]
*  and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=10.36s)]
*  at Stanford School of Medicine. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=13.700000000000001s)]
*  Today we're discussing the vagus nerve. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=15.6s)]
*  The vagus nerve, or what neuroanatomists call [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=18.32s)]
*  cranial nerve 10, is an extremely interesting nerve [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=20.7s)]
*  because when we hear the word nerve, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=24.32s)]
*  we often think of a small connection [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=26.560000000000002s)]
*  between one thing and another, the wires of the nerve, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=29.64s)]
*  which of course we call axons. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=32.32s)]
*  If you didn't know that, now you know, they're called axons. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=34.24s)]
*  But actually the cranial nerve is an extensive pathway. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=36.94s)]
*  It's a whole set of connections [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=40.52s)]
*  that link the brain and body. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  In fact, in many respects, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=44.02s)]
*  it looks kind of like its own nervous system [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=46.32s)]
*  within the traditional nervous system [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  of the brain and the spinal cord, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=51.08s)]
*  the connections between spinal cord and muscle. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  The vagus nerve is so vast, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=55.519999999999996s)]
*  it spreads out through so much of the body. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=57.44s)]
*  And as you'll learn today, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=60.04s)]
*  it's connected to so many interesting different brain areas [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=61.879999999999995s)]
*  and has so many interesting different functions [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=64.88s)]
*  that it deserves, well, an entire episode of this podcast. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=67.75999999999999s)]
*  The other great thing about the vagus nerve [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=71.8s)]
*  is it is highly actionable, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=73.47999999999999s)]
*  meaning what you will learn today, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=75.44s)]
*  if you already know something about the vagus nerve [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=77.92s)]
*  is going to change what you know [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=80.0s)]
*  and believe about the vagus nerve. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=81.74s)]
*  What you hear today will also, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=83.6s)]
*  if you don't know or you're not familiar [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=85.36s)]
*  with the vagus nerve, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=87.4s)]
*  is going to educate you on the latest about the vagus nerve. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=88.62s)]
*  We've learned a lot about the vagus nerve [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=91.36s)]
*  and ways to control the vagus nerve in the last few years. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=93.24s)]
*  And finally, and perhaps most importantly, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=96.36s)]
*  the information that you're going to learn today [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=98.78s)]
*  includes actionable tools that will, for instance, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=100.44s)]
*  allow you to make yourself more alert when you want to [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=103.62s)]
*  without the use of pharmacology. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=106.88s)]
*  It will allow you to calm yourself down quickly [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=108.78s)]
*  when you want to, on demand, and quickly [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=111.44s)]
*  without the use of pharmacology or devices. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=114.3s)]
*  And it will also allow you to alter your mood [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=117.42s)]
*  for the better and indeed to improve your ability to learn. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=120.7s)]
*  The vagus nerve is that important. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=124.53999999999999s)]
*  It's involved in that many different things. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=126.34s)]
*  And the pathways of the vagus nerve, as I mentioned, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=128.34s)]
*  have been charted in more detail in recent years. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=130.82s)]
*  And the ways that we can get into the vagus nerve [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=133.7s)]
*  and stimulate its actions in specific ways [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=136.2s)]
*  to achieve those endpoints of improved mood, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=138.86s)]
*  deeper relaxation, fast relaxation, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=141.48s)]
*  elevated levels of alertness, and on and on, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=144.07999999999998s)]
*  are now very well understood. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=146.82s)]
*  So as you can probably tell, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=149.51999999999998s)]
*  I'm extremely excited about today's episode [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=150.73999999999998s)]
*  because the vagus nerve is just one of the most [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=152.76s)]
*  fascinating aspects to our nervous system. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=154.83999999999997s)]
*  You have one, I have one. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=157.23999999999998s)]
*  So let's figure out how they work [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=159.17999999999998s)]
*  and how to put it to work for the better. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=160.76s)]
*  Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=163.33999999999997s)]
*  is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=165.83999999999997s)]
*  It is, however, part of my desire and effort [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=168.45999999999998s)]
*  to bring zero cost to consumer information about science [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=170.6s)]
*  and science related tools to the general public. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=173.22s)]
*  In keeping with that theme, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=175.76s)]
*  today's episode does include sponsors. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=177.16s)]
*  Our first sponsor is Element. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=179.78s)]
*  Element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=181.79999999999998s)]
*  and nothing you don't. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=184.38s)]
*  That means the electrolytes, sodium, magnesium, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=185.6s)]
*  and potassium in the correct amounts, but no sugar. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=187.9s)]
*  Proper hydration is critical [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=190.57999999999998s)]
*  for optimal brain and body function. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=191.88s)]
*  Even a slight degree of dehydration [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=194.28s)]
*  can diminish cognitive and physical performance. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=195.92s)]
*  It's also important that you get adequate electrolytes. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=198.64s)]
*  The electrolytes, sodium, magnesium, and potassium [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=200.95999999999998s)]
*  are vital for functioning of all the cells in your body, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=203.83999999999997s)]
*  especially your neurons or your nerve cells. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=206.39999999999998s)]
*  Drinking Element dissolved in water makes it very easy [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=208.95999999999998s)]
*  to ensure that you're getting adequate hydration [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=211.23999999999998s)]
*  and adequate electrolytes. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=213.44s)]
*  To make sure that I'm getting proper amounts of hydration [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=215.06s)]
*  and electrolytes, I dissolve one packet of Element [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=217.2s)]
*  in about 16 to 32 ounces of water [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=219.95999999999998s)]
*  when I first wake up in the morning. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=221.95999999999998s)]
*  And I drink that basically first thing in the morning. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=223.35999999999999s)]
*  I'll also drink Element dissolved in water [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=226.0s)]
*  during any kind of physical exercise that I'm doing, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=227.68s)]
*  especially on hot days when I'm sweating a lot [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=230.1s)]
*  and losing water and electrolytes. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=232.12s)]
*  Element has a bunch of great tasting flavors. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=234.24s)]
*  I love the raspberry, I love the citrus flavor. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=236.64000000000001s)]
*  Right now, Element has a limited edition lemonade flavor [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=238.8s)]
*  that is absolutely delicious. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=241.8s)]
*  I hate to say that I love one more than all the others, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=243.4s)]
*  but this lemonade flavor is right up there [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=245.9s)]
*  with my favorite other one, which is raspberry or watermelon. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=247.74s)]
*  Again, I can't pick just one flavor, I love them all. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=250.68s)]
*  If you'd like to try Element, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=253.46s)]

*  improvements in acne, reduced pain and inflammation, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=295.56s)]
*  even mitochondrial function and improving vision itself. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=298.76s)]
*  What sets Juve lights apart [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=302.0s)]
*  and why they're my preferred red light therapy device [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=303.32s)]
*  is that they use clinically proven wavelengths, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=305.92s)]
*  meaning specific wavelengths of red light [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=307.94s)]
*  and near infrared light in combination [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=310.2s)]
*  to trigger the optimal cellar adaptations. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=312.4s)]
*  Personally, I use the Juve whole body panel [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=315.17999999999995s)]
*  about three to four times a week [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=317.34s)]
*  and I use the Juve handheld light [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=318.88s)]
*  both at home and when I travel. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=320.76s)]
*  If you'd like to try Juve, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=322.91999999999996s)]
*  you can go to Juve spelled J-O-O-V-V.com slash Huberman. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=324.03999999999996s)]
*  Juve is offering an exclusive discount [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=328.85999999999996s)]
*  to all Huberman Lab listeners [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=330.71999999999997s)]
*  with up to $400 off Juve products. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=332.4s)]
*  Again, that's Juve spelled J-O-O-V-V.com slash Huberman [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=335.0s)]
*  to get up to $400 off. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=339.5s)]
*  Okay, let's get familiar with the vagus nerve. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=341.56s)]
*  The vagus nerve is cranial nerve 10. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=344.3s)]
*  The vagus nerve is very different [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=347.08s)]
*  than the other cranial nerves [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=348.72s)]
*  because whereas it does have connections [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=349.88s)]
*  with areas on the face, head and neck [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=352.0s)]
*  and deep to those areas too, so throat, et cetera, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=355.56s)]
*  it also has connections where I should say [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=358.28s)]
*  it receives and provides connections [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=360.56s)]
*  to areas within the body. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=363.84000000000003s)]
*  In fact, it has connections with the head area, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=365.8s)]
*  the neck area, the chest area, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=368.06s)]
*  the abdomen and even a bit lower into the lower intestines. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=371.1s)]
*  So the vagus nerve is super extensive [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=375.12s)]
*  in terms of its outputs and its inputs. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=378.1s)]
*  And I'll explain what I mean by outputs and inputs [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=381.28000000000003s)]
*  in just a moment. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=383.22s)]
*  But what's very useful to understand [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=384.38s)]
*  and visualize in your mind a bit, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=386.22s)]
*  anytime we're talking about the vagus nerve [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=387.74s)]
*  is we're talking about a nerve [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=389.78000000000003s)]
*  of many, many different pathways [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=391.48s)]
*  that both receives and provides information [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=393.86s)]
*  from essentially all areas of the body [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=397.20000000000005s)]
*  down to the base of your pelvis. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=399.3s)]
*  And that stands in stark contrast [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=401.1s)]
*  from the other cranial nerves [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=403.1s)]
*  which tend to receive information [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=404.48s)]
*  from restricted areas of the body, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=406.84000000000003s)]
*  most typically the head and neck area [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=408.8s)]
*  and that tend to provide connections [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=412.22s)]
*  to the head and neck area. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=415.06s)]
*  The word vagus actually translates more or less to vagabond [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=416.98s)]
*  which means wandering. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=420.5s)]
*  So early neuroanatomists saw that this nerve, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=421.90000000000003s)]
*  cranial nerve 10, had connections to large areas [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=424.22s)]
*  of the body and head and neck [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=427.78s)]
*  and received inputs from lots of areas of the body [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=429.38s)]
*  and decided to call it essentially the vagabond nerve [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=432.41999999999996s)]
*  or the vagus nerve. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=435.02s)]
*  Now, even though the word vagabond [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=436.58s)]
*  means essentially wandering [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=438.28s)]
*  and the word wandering kind of suggests random, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=439.9s)]
*  there is nothing random about the wiring of the vagus nerve. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=442.65999999999997s)]
*  The vagus nerve is incredibly precise [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=446.21999999999997s)]
*  in terms of where it receives information from [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=449.09999999999997s)]
*  and where it provides information to. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=451.97999999999996s)]
*  Now I want to be very clear what I mean about information. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=454.53999999999996s)]
*  If you're a biologist, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=457.98s)]
*  you'll probably understand some of this. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=459.14000000000004s)]
*  If you're not, and I have to assume most of you are not, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=460.90000000000003s)]
*  it's still very important that you understand [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=464.18s)]
*  and it's very easy to understand that your nervous system, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=466.42s)]
*  your brain, spinal cord, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=469.28000000000003s)]
*  and of course your nervous system [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=471.22s)]
*  includes all these cranial nerves, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=472.24s)]
*  including the vagus nerve, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=473.42s)]
*  are carrying different types of information [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=475.04s)]
*  along different pathways, different neurons [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=477.02000000000004s)]
*  or different nerve cells within the vagus nerve, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=479.02000000000004s)]
*  for instance, are receiving or giving [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=481.32000000000005s)]
*  different types of information for different purposes. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=484.5s)]
*  For instance, there is sensory information [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=487.53999999999996s)]
*  carried by neurons, nerve cells in your nervous system. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=490.91999999999996s)]
*  Sensory information is the kind of information [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=494.14s)]
*  that for instance, converts light into electrical signals [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=496.38s)]
*  at the level of your eyes. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=501.02s)]
*  Then your eyes are providing information to the brain [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=502.52s)]
*  about what's out in the visual world. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=504.78s)]
*  That's sensory information. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=506.38s)]
*  The same could be said for sound waves. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=508.78s)]
*  That's sensory information [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=511.59999999999997s)]
*  that your auditory system converts to [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=512.94s)]
*  basically your understanding of speech and sound [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=515.34s)]
*  and music, et cetera. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=517.36s)]
*  Other neurons control motor functions, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=519.0200000000001s)]
*  literally the movement of your limbs [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=521.34s)]
*  by controlling contraction of your muscles [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=523.44s)]
*  or the movement of your lips [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=525.58s)]
*  or the closing or opening of your airways, for instance. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=527.1600000000001s)]
*  So motor information, of course, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=531.5s)]
*  can be seen on the surface of the body. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=535.0400000000001s)]
*  I'm moving my hands now, I'm moving my mouth. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=536.5200000000001s)]
*  You don't even need to see me do that [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=538.22s)]
*  to know that I'm doing that. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=539.4200000000001s)]
*  But within our body, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=541.22s)]
*  we have organs that also need motor control. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=542.86s)]
*  For instance, our gut. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=546.12s)]
*  Our gut is not just a passive tube through which food moves. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=548.5400000000001s)]
*  The gut is contracting and relaxing. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=551.94s)]
*  It's moving food through from one end to the other, okay? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=554.12s)]
*  We have our pancreas, we have our liver, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=557.9s)]
*  we have our spleen. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=560.6600000000001s)]
*  And you might think, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=561.7s)]
*  oh, well, those are sort of vegetative organs. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=562.5400000000001s)]
*  They just kind of sit there. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=564.02s)]
*  Maybe the cells do stuff, but they don't move much. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=565.26s)]
*  But actually your spleen even has a contractile ability. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=567.48s)]
*  So it can contract to release red blood cells [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=571.1s)]
*  or immune cells into circulation and so on and so forth. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=573.14s)]
*  Different organs, including your muscles, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=577.22s)]
*  but other organs as well, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=579.26s)]
*  need instructions as to when they should move, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=581.02s)]
*  when they should contract, when they should relax. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=584.4200000000001s)]
*  So we have sensory information that's carried by [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=586.7s)]
*  essentially one set of neurons in our nervous system. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=589.14s)]
*  So carrying light information or sound information. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=592.26s)]
*  Whereas you'll see in a few minutes, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=595.22s)]
*  chemical information about the acidity of the gut, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=596.34s)]
*  for instance. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=599.38s)]
*  And we have neurons that are considered motor neurons. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=601.76s)]
*  They control the contraction of muscles [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=604.48s)]
*  or the contraction of these different organs [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=606.16s)]
*  or the encouragement for different aspects [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=608.0s)]
*  of the digestive tract to contract or relax, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=611.28s)]
*  to move food along. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=613.46s)]
*  Okay, so we've got sensory neurons [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=614.8s)]
*  and we have motor neurons. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=616.5s)]
*  And then there are a lot of other neurons as well [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=617.72s)]
*  that we call modulatory neurons. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=619.6s)]
*  They kind of adjust the balance [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=621.4s)]
*  between the sensory information and motor information. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=623.0s)]
*  We aren't going to talk so much today [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=625.36s)]
*  about modulatory neurons, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=626.64s)]
*  but they are an important third category [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=628.4s)]
*  of neuron in the nervous system. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=630.4s)]
*  Now, why am I telling you all this stuff [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=632.3199999999999s)]
*  about sensory and motor? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=633.6s)]
*  Because the vagus nerve is also unique [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=634.68s)]
*  in that it is both a sensory pathway and a motor pathway. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=637.52s)]
*  And this is something that most discussions [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=642.24s)]
*  about the vagus nerve, in fact, I would say 99% [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=644.56s)]
*  of discussions about the vagus nerve that you see online [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=648.36s)]
*  or when you hear about, forgive me, in your yoga classes. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=651.3199999999999s)]
*  By the way, I'm going to touch on how yoga [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=654.1s)]
*  and ancient yogic practices actually managed [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=656.4s)]
*  to tease apart some very important functions [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=659.16s)]
*  of the vagus nerve without knowing any [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=661.16s)]
*  of the underlying mechanisms. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=662.56s)]
*  But it is the case that most of the time, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=664.1999999999999s)]
*  when you hear about the vagus nerve out there [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=666.0s)]
*  in the general world or in the media, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=667.9s)]
*  it's about the vagus nerve being a calming pathway [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=670.4s)]
*  that's involved in transmitting information [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=673.52s)]
*  about the sensory milieu of the body. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=675.78s)]
*  So, you know, heart rate, acidity of the gut, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=678.12s)]
*  you know, how comfortable we are in our body to our brain. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=682.02s)]
*  And people will say you want to activate the vagus nerve [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=684.84s)]
*  because you want to calm down. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=687.44s)]
*  Well, that is true, but that is just one small fraction [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=689.8000000000001s)]
*  of the functions of the vagus nerve. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=693.48s)]
*  Why? [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=695.24s)]
*  Because the vagus nerve includes both sensory [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=696.0600000000001s)]
*  and motor neurons within it. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=698.58s)]
*  And while it is true that a ton of sensory information [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=700.9200000000001s)]
*  is coursing up from the organs of the body into the brain [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=704.4s)]
*  through what we call the vagus nerve, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=707.76s)]
*  there's also motor information coming [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=710.1s)]
*  from the brain to the body. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=712.2s)]
*  So if we are going to have an accurate, meaningful, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=714.72s)]
*  actionable conversation about the vagus nerve, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=717.3000000000001s)]
*  it's very important that you know [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=719.76s)]
*  that the vagus nerve contains sensory neurons [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=721.0400000000001s)]
*  as well as motor neurons. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=723.82s)]
*  And I want to be clear that I'm not just telling you [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=725.64s)]
*  about sensory versus motor neurons in the vagus nerve [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=727.24s)]
*  to just overload you with nomenclature. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=730.0400000000001s)]
*  Turns out that if you want to access the calming aspects [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=732.36s)]
*  of vagus nerve activation [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=735.6s)]
*  versus the energizing effects of vagus nerve activation [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=738.14s)]
*  versus the immune enhancing effects [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=742.46s)]
*  of vagus nerve activation versus the ways [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=744.6600000000001s)]
*  that you can improve learning using vagus nerve activation, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=747.38s)]
*  you need to know whether or not you're trying to activate [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=751.0600000000001s)]
*  a sensory pathway or a motor pathway [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=753.74s)]
*  within this vast set of connections [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=756.7800000000001s)]
*  that we call the vagus nerve. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=758.5s)]
*  Okay, so I want to just briefly describe [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=760.4200000000001s)]
*  the sensory pathways within the vagus nerve. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=762.22s)]
*  And by the way, if you're a yoga teacher, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=765.1800000000001s)]
*  if you are a therapist, if you are a teacher, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=767.76s)]
*  if you are a human being on earth, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=770.5s)]
*  this information is going to be very useful to you [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=773.02s)]
*  because this is the information [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=775.06s)]
*  that will allow you to understand why it is [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=776.86s)]
*  that when your body is in a certain comfortable [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=779.62s)]
*  or uncomfortable state, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=782.12s)]
*  it has a particular effect on your mind and your brain [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=783.98s)]
*  to feel, well, in general, comfortable or uncomfortable. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=787.66s)]
*  Your vagus nerve includes very interesting [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=791.84s)]
*  and kind of unusually shaped neurons. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=793.82s)]
*  Okay, the neurons of the vagus nerve [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=796.46s)]
*  are not like the ones that you see in the typical picture [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=798.58s)]
*  if you were to look up neuron online. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=801.26s)]
*  If you were to look up neuron online, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=803.0s)]
*  what you would find is you'd see a picture [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=804.6800000000001s)]
*  of what's called a cell body where the nucleus, the DNA is. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=806.5400000000001s)]
*  You'd see what are called dendrites, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=809.76s)]
*  which typically are the area where neurons receive input. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=811.14s)]
*  And then you'd see the wire-like extension [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=814.1s)]
*  that we call the axon out to the area [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=816.22s)]
*  that that neuron communicates with. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=818.94s)]
*  And then you might see a little picture [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=820.58s)]
*  of some little blobs or what we call vesicles [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=821.82s)]
*  being released at the end of that axon. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=824.6s)]
*  That is not at all what vagal nerve neurons look like. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=826.68s)]
*  Some of them do, but the vast majority, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=831.28s)]
*  about 85% of the neurons in the vagus nerve [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=833.3399999999999s)]
*  have a cell body with that DNA, with the nucleus in it, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=837.16s)]
*  sitting in an area kind of near your neck [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=840.54s)]
*  and back of your head, sort of what we call the brainstem. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=843.88s)]
*  And it's called the nodos ganglion. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=847.52s)]
*  Now, the nodos ganglion is a collection [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=850.0799999999999s)]
*  of cell bodies of neurons. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=852.0999999999999s)]
*  So you can think of it kind of like a cluster of grapes. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=853.78s)]
*  And they do indeed have an axon extending from them, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=856.6999999999999s)]
*  a wire that goes out to the body, okay? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=859.68s)]
*  That wire looks for all the world, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=863.6s)]
*  like the axons on any other neurons. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=865.5799999999999s)]
*  And that little axon can be very short [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=867.98s)]
*  if it terminates, as we say, in an area of the neck. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=869.8s)]
*  It can be slightly longer if it terminates [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=873.36s)]
*  in the chest area, and even longer [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=875.02s)]
*  if it goes to what we call our viscera, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=877.12s)]
*  our lungs, our pancreas, our liver, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=879.48s)]
*  down to any number of different organs [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=883.32s)]
*  within our major abdominal body compartment, okay? [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=885.7600000000001s)]
*  You also see an axon, a little wire [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=889.2600000000001s)]
*  from a vagal sensory neuron out to the spleen. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=891.74s)]
*  Now, what I just described, a cell body [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=895.6s)]
*  with an axon extending from it [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=898.2600000000001s)]
*  out to the organs of the body, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=900.1400000000001s)]
*  different organs of the body tend to be innervated [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=901.94s)]
*  by different neurons, not always, but in general. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=904.22s)]
*  But here's what's different about these vagal neurons. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=908.94s)]
*  These vagal neurons have another axon [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=912.22s)]
*  that goes from the cell body. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=915.36s)]
*  So they're what we call a bipolar neuron. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=916.6800000000001s)]
*  They have another axon that extends up into the brainstem [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=918.36s)]
*  and terminates in generally one of three different, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=922.62s)]
*  what we call brainstem nuclei, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=925.36s)]
*  which are just areas of the brainstem. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=927.08s)]
*  So this is very important to embed in your mind, right? [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=929.0400000000001s)]
*  Because in reality, embedded in your head and neck [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=931.5600000000001s)]
*  or in your brain and neck are these neurons, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=935.1s)]
*  which are kind of like a cluster of grapes [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=937.5600000000001s)]
*  that have, each one is going to have two branches, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=939.1600000000001s)]
*  one that goes out to a particular organ of the body [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=941.88s)]
*  and another branch that goes up into your brainstem. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=945.38s)]
*  Now, this visual understanding, [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=948.7s)]
*  which hopefully is starting to take place in your mind, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=950.62s)]
*  is extremely important to understand [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=953.3s)]
*  how 85% of the vagus nerve works. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=955.54s)]
*  85% of the vagus nerve works by having these neurons [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=958.14s)]
*  that have axons in, say, the spleen or around the lungs [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=961.7s)]
*  or that innervate the heart [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=966.0s)]
*  or that innervate any number of different organs [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=967.82s)]
*  in your body. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=969.88s)]
*  And they collect sensory information [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=971.64s)]
*  about what's going on in each and every one of those organs. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=974.98s)]
*  That information goes up the axon. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=979.02s)]
*  Remember, there's a cell body is in the nodos ganglion, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=981.56s)]
*  and then it goes further up, [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=983.98s)]
*  past the cell body into the brainstem. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=985.76s)]
*  Okay, so when people talk about the vagus nerve, [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=988.42s)]
*  cranial nerve 10, as being a sensory pathway, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=990.54s)]
*  it is mostly a sensory pathway. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=994.36s)]
*  It's collecting information through these axons. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=996.46s)]
*  Why is that weird? [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=999.22s)]
*  Well, it's not weird, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1000.48s)]
*  but it's different than the way we normally talk about neurons [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1001.6600000000001s)]
*  where the axon is the output end, right? [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1003.94s)]
*  Where it's dumping stuff onto the next neuron [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1005.9200000000001s)]
*  to make things happen. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1007.72s)]
*  The neurons in the nodos ganglion of the vagus nerve, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1009.52s)]
*  I know that's a lot of language, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1012.28s)]
*  but these neurons that send an axon branch [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1013.32s)]
*  out to the organs of the body [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1016.72s)]
*  are collecting information about what's happening, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1018.4s)]
*  what sensory information is occurring out at those organs. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1021.3000000000001s)]
*  And that information goes up those wires, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1026.06s)]
*  past the cell body and into the brainstem, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1028.48s)]
*  and then that's communicated to the brain. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1031.14s)]
*  So basically we can think of 85% of the vagus nerve, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1034.42s)]
*  this huge super highway from the body to the brain [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1038.38s)]
*  as being sensory. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1041.76s)]
*  And when we talk about sensory, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1043.42s)]
*  it's important that you understand [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1045.28s)]
*  that two types of sensory information [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1046.54s)]
*  are coming in through these wires, through these axons, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1048.52s)]
*  and that are delivered to the brain. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1051.98s)]
*  And in response to that sensory information, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1053.92s)]
*  as you'll soon learn, your brain will change, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1056.1s)]
*  its levels of alertness. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1058.22s)]
*  Sometimes it gets more alert, sometimes it gets calmer. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1059.26s)]
*  Sometimes it primes you to learn better. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1062.0s)]
*  Sometimes it will turn on a fever. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1064.42s)]
*  It will literally heat up your entire body [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1067.1000000000001s)]
*  based on what those axons are sensing out in the periphery, [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1069.04s)]
*  the periphery of course, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1075.0s)]
*  being the organs and tissues of your body [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1075.8600000000001s)]
*  outside your brain and spinal cord. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1077.8s)]
*  So I realize that's a bit of neuroanatomy [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1079.92s)]
*  for those of you that aren't familiar with neuroanatomy, [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1081.64s)]
*  it might seem like an overwhelming amount of neuroanatomy, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1083.44s)]
*  but it's extremely important to have that idea [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1086.24s)]
*  in your mind of sensory information flowing up [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1088.12s)]
*  into the brain from your organs, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1090.78s)]
*  because anatomically speaking and functionally speaking, [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1093.5s)]
*  it runs exactly opposite to how we typically see neurons [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1096.7399999999998s)]
*  when they're drawn in diagrams for us, [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1100.62s)]
*  and how we talk about neurons as just putting stuff out [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1102.2399999999998s)]
*  at the level of the axon at the end of those wires, [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1104.6399999999999s)]
*  information's coming up those wires [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1107.3s)]
*  in the case of the vagus. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1109.2399999999998s)]
*  Okay, so whereas for the visual system [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1110.58s)]
*  or the auditory system or for the smell system [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1113.06s)]
*  or the taste system, [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1116.24s)]
*  typically we have one type of sensory information coming in. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1118.08s)]
*  So for instance, in the visual system, [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1121.28s)]
*  light photons of energy are converted [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1123.3s)]
*  into electrical signals that the rest [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1125.94s)]
*  of the visual system unpacks to give you visual perceptions, [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1127.6s)]
*  to control your circadian rhythms, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1131.22s)]
*  or in the case of the auditory system, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1132.98s)]
*  you have sound waves, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1134.28s)]
*  which are transduced by this beautiful mechanism [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1135.68s)]
*  of your inner ear that then gets converted [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1138.92s)]
*  into your understanding of speech or music, et cetera. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1141.68s)]
*  In the case of the vagus nerve, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1144.84s)]
*  the sensory information coming from your organs, [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1146.9599999999998s)]
*  from your lungs, from your gut. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1150.24s)]
*  And by the way, your gut, when I say that, [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1152.28s)]
*  I don't just mean your stomach, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1154.08s)]
*  I also mean the large and small intestine [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1155.6599999999999s)]
*  and all the stuff above your stomach as well. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1157.28s)]
*  The sensory information that's coming from the body [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1159.86s)]
*  includes both chemical information [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1162.9599999999998s)]
*  and mechanical information. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1165.9599999999998s)]
*  Now, the mechanical information [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1168.1399999999999s)]
*  is pretty straightforward to understand. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1169.3999999999999s)]
*  If your gut is full of food or air or water [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1171.24s)]
*  and it's very distended, you can feel that. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1174.12s)]
*  The reason you can feel that is because [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1176.8999999999999s)]
*  you have mechanoreceptors that sense stretch [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1178.3799999999999s)]
*  in the lining of the gut and send that information [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1182.3999999999999s)]
*  by way of those axons up to and past the nodos ganglion. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1186.12s)]
*  There's some processing of that information, [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1190.6s)]
*  the nodos ganglion, but then it goes up [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1192.12s)]
*  and into your brainstem, okay? [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1194.12s)]
*  Now, also within the gut, you have chemical information. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1196.56s)]
*  There's information about, for instance, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1200.2399999999998s)]
*  and we'll talk more about this later, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1201.9399999999998s)]
*  how much serotonin is in the gut. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1203.56s)]
*  You may have heard that 90% of the serotonin in your body [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1205.8s)]
*  is manufactured in the gut, [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1208.8799999999999s)]
*  and indeed it's manufactured in your gut. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1210.76s)]
*  It plays an important role in gut motility and gut health. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1212.6399999999999s)]
*  The serotonin in your gut is distinct [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1217.3999999999999s)]
*  from the serotonin released in your brain. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1219.44s)]
*  Later, we'll talk about how the levels of serotonin [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1221.3999999999999s)]
*  in your gut are conveyed to the brain [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1223.56s)]
*  by way of, you guessed it, the vagus nerve, [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1226.48s)]
*  and your brain in turn makes different levels [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1229.12s)]
*  of serotonin to impact your mood. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1232.16s)]
*  Super interesting, super important pathway [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1234.4s)]
*  has relevance for depression [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1236.5600000000002s)]
*  and just for everyday mood and wellbeing. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1237.8000000000002s)]
*  We'll talk about it. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1239.5600000000002s)]
*  It's a highly actionable pathway, super cool. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1240.4s)]
*  So you have mechanical information [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1243.8200000000002s)]
*  and you have chemical information coming from, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1245.28s)]
*  for instance, your gut up through the sensory [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1248.0400000000002s)]
*  in the technical nomenclature, it's called afference. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1251.0400000000002s)]
*  Afference is a technical language. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1253.92s)]
*  Feel free to ignore this, [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1255.52s)]
*  but for those of you that want to know, [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1256.44s)]
*  you aficionados already know this, [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1257.5600000000002s)]
*  the afference are the inputs to a structure. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1259.42s)]
*  Efference are the inputs from a structure. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1262.26s)]
*  But what we've got in the case of the gut [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1264.94s)]
*  is mechanical and chemical information being sensed [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1267.42s)]
*  by different neurons with different receptors [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1271.0600000000002s)]
*  that pay attention to different things, [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1273.22s)]
*  meaning those receptors are activated [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1275.3000000000002s)]
*  by either mechanical stretch or by the presence [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1277.5600000000002s)]
*  or absence of particular chemicals in the gut, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1279.88s)]
*  how acidic the gut is, and that information goes up, [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1282.52s)]
*  processed a bit in the no-dose ganglion, [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1285.44s)]
*  and then relayed up to the brainstem. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1286.9s)]
*  And we'll talk in a moment about what happens [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1288.78s)]
*  to that information after it lands in the brainstem. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1290.34s)]
*  Now, chemical and mechanical information [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1293.78s)]
*  is also being conveyed from other structures in the body. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1296.18s)]
*  You can probably imagine what some of these are, [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1299.3799999999999s)]
*  and we don't have to go through each and every one, [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1301.26s)]
*  but as one additional example to the gut, [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1302.8999999999999s)]
*  I'll just use, for instance, the lungs. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1304.74s)]
*  When your lungs expand and contract as you breathe, [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1306.5s)]
*  that information is relayed up through [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1311.6s)]
*  and past the no-dose ganglion and up into the brainstem. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1315.18s)]
*  And as you can imagine, your lungs, [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1318.58s)]
*  because you're inhaling oxygen [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1320.08s)]
*  and you're also offloading carbon dioxide, [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1321.78s)]
*  your lungs are expanding and contracting. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1324.06s)]
*  Your lungs are also communicating mechanical [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1326.94s)]
*  and chemical oxygen-carbon dioxide ratio information [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1329.74s)]
*  up to the brain. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1333.1399999999999s)]
*  Now, if we wanted to, we could explore and discuss [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1334.1s)]
*  every single organ of your body that gets axon input [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1335.84s)]
*  from the vagus nerve and therefore can carry sensory [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1338.98s)]
*  information up the vagus. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1341.58s)]
*  And again, there's going to be information [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1343.42s)]
*  about the chemical environment [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1344.92s)]
*  and the mechanical status of each of those organs [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1347.26s)]
*  carried up to your brainstem. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1350.22s)]
*  We're not going to do that now for sake of time, [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1351.66s)]
*  but it's very important that you now take a step back [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1353.94s)]
*  and you realize, hmm, I understand [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1356.52s)]
*  what sensory information is. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1358.58s)]
*  I understand that it's different than motor information. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1360.1s)]
*  It's carried by different neurons in the nervous system. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1362.34s)]
*  The vagus nerve has both sensory and motor neurons. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1364.36s)]
*  The sensory neurons are collecting information [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1368.42s)]
*  from all these bodily organs. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1370.68s)]
*  And by the way, those bodily organs don't just stop [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1372.0s)]
*  at the level of the lungs. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1374.22s)]
*  It includes the heart, it includes some stuff [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1375.24s)]
*  that's happening in the neck, [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1377.38s)]
*  some of the muscles that are controlling [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1379.44s)]
*  the constriction of the airways. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1381.04s)]
*  We'll get into this a little bit more in a few minutes, [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1382.54s)]
*  but you now also know that when we talk about collecting [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1384.64s)]
*  sensory information from the body and sending it [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1388.1200000000001s)]
*  to the brain by these vagal pathways, [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1390.28s)]
*  that the types of sensory information include [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1393.38s)]
*  both chemical and mechanical information. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1395.56s)]
*  And the reason that's important is not just academic [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1398.76s)]
*  and intellectual, it's not just to fill the airspace [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1401.2s)]
*  with nomenclature. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1403.38s)]
*  It's because if you're going to think about ways [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1404.7600000000002s)]
*  to change the activity of the vagus system, [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1407.8200000000002s)]
*  the ways to, for instance, calm down, [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1411.0s)]
*  or the ways to improve your immune system function, [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1413.64s)]
*  or to improve your mood in the short and long term, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1416.1000000000001s)]
*  you need to ask yourself, [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1419.0400000000002s)]
*  am I going to do that through a mechanical change, [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1420.18s)]
*  or am I going to do that by making a change [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1423.8000000000002s)]
*  to the chemical milieu of a given organ or set of organs? [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1426.1000000000001s)]
*  So to drive the point I just made home, [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1429.3400000000001s)]
*  let's take an example that we see a lot out there, [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1431.42s)]
*  which is that if you want to increase the activity [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1433.9s)]
*  of your vagus nerve, you want to calm down. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1436.8600000000001s)]
*  Why am I saying calm down? [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1439.3400000000001s)]
*  I neglected to say earlier that, by the way, [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1440.72s)]
*  every medical student and pre-med student should know, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1442.76s)]
*  which is that cranial nerve 10, the vagus nerve, [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1445.3400000000001s)]
*  is classified as a parasympathetic nerve. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1447.42s)]
*  Parasympathetic refers to one branch [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1450.3400000000001s)]
*  of the so-called autonomic nervous system. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1452.8400000000001s)]
*  The autonomic nervous system controls your levels [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1454.8600000000001s)]
*  of alertness and your levels of calm. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1456.8600000000001s)]
*  It has two major branches. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1458.76s)]
*  One branch is called the sympathetic nervous system. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1460.18s)]
*  It has nothing to do with emotional sympathy. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1462.5800000000002s)]
*  The sympathetic nervous system is generally responsible [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1464.5800000000002s)]
*  for increasing our levels of alertness, [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1468.22s)]
*  everything from being alert like I am now, [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1470.5800000000002s)]
*  all the way up to full-blown panic attack, [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1473.46s)]
*  which fortunately I'm not right now. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1475.3400000000001s)]
*  The parasympathetic nervous system is often referred to [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1477.66s)]
*  as the rest and digest system. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1480.38s)]
*  And indeed it has roles in rest and digestion, [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1482.42s)]
*  but it controls a lot more than just that. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1485.5s)]
*  The parasympathetic branch [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1487.6200000000001s)]
*  of the autonomic nervous system controls, [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1488.84s)]
*  for instance, digestion. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1490.9599999999998s)]
*  It controls our ability to fall asleep at night. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1493.52s)]
*  If the parasympathetic nervous system is overly activated, [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1496.1399999999999s)]
*  it can make us sleepy when we don't want to be sleepy. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1499.3999999999999s)]
*  It can make us pass out when we don't want to pass out. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1501.8799999999999s)]
*  It can be responsible for putting people [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1504.8s)]
*  into a state of coma. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1506.8s)]
*  So it's not good to think about the sympathetic nervous [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1508.22s)]
*  system simply as fight or flight, [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1510.02s)]
*  how it's often referred to, [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1511.9199999999998s)]
*  because it's also responsible for generating healthy, [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1513.08s)]
*  wakeful, non-anxious, non-stressed levels of alertness, [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1516.36s)]
*  as well as stressed out panic states. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1519.08s)]
*  And the parasympathetic nervous system is responsible [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1522.24s)]
*  for putting us into a calm and relaxed state [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1524.3799999999999s)]
*  or a deep sleep state or a coma state, [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1527.1599999999999s)]
*  if it were to be hyper-activated. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1531.32s)]
*  The autonomic nervous system is a seesaw [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1533.28s)]
*  where the levels of alertness and calm [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1535.28s)]
*  that we experience at any one moment [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1537.78s)]
*  reflect the relative balance of sympathetic nervous system [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1539.3799999999999s)]
*  and parasympathetic nervous system activity. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1542.24s)]
*  They're serving a push-pull with one another. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1544.44s)]
*  Increase the parasympathetic nervous system activity [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1546.46s)]
*  a little bit, you get a bit calmer. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1548.76s)]
*  Increase the sympathetic nervous system activity [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1550.2s)]
*  a little bit, you get a bit more alert, [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1552.0800000000002s)]
*  but they're always both active. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1553.64s)]
*  The vagus nerve is classified as a parasympathetic nerve. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1555.96s)]
*  However, it's a bit of a misnomer, [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1560.18s)]
*  because as you'll soon realize, [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1563.3600000000001s)]
*  there are pathways within the vagus nerve [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1565.02s)]
*  that were you to activate these pathways [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1567.3600000000001s)]
*  within the vagus nerve, [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1569.64s)]
*  you would become more alert, not less alert. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1570.8200000000002s)]
*  This is one of the things that I'm hoping to dispel [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1574.38s)]
*  through the course of this episode, [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1576.38s)]
*  which is this very common myth out there. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1578.1000000000001s)]
*  It's almost pervasive that when you activate the vagus nerve, [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1580.2800000000002s)]
*  you're going to calm down. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1584.14s)]
*  It is simply not true. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1585.3400000000001s)]
*  Okay, there are instances where that is true. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1587.6200000000001s)]
*  There are instances where the opposite is true, [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1590.0200000000002s)]
*  depending on which branch of the vagus nerve [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1592.14s)]
*  you happen to activate or suppress. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1595.0200000000002s)]
*  One example, however, [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1597.5s)]
*  where activating a particular branch of the vagus nerve [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1598.94s)]
*  does indeed lead to more relaxation [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1601.74s)]
*  is the branch of the vagus nerve that, again, is sensory. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1605.14s)]
*  So it's taking information about mechanical phenomenon, [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1608.94s)]
*  in this case, pressure or touch, [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1611.7s)]
*  and it's sending that information [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1614.94s)]
*  down into the brainstem areas [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1616.8600000000001s)]
*  that are going to interpret that information. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1619.22s)]
*  This branch of the vagus nerve [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1622.0800000000002s)]
*  that is carrying sensory information [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1623.94s)]
*  doesn't come from the viscera or the neck, [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1625.6200000000001s)]
*  it comes from the head. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1628.18s)]
*  And it's the branch of the vagus nerve [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1629.26s)]
*  that essentially goes behind the ear [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1631.22s)]
*  and in some of the deeper components of the ear. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1634.46s)]
*  Remember they tell you, [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1637.1000000000001s)]
*  don't put anything into your ear [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1637.94s)]
*  that's smaller than your elbow? [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1638.76s)]
*  Well, I'm breaking that rule right now, [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1642.3s)]
*  and I'm putting my index finger into my ear [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1644.06s)]
*  and kind of rubbing in a circular way [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1646.34s)]
*  that kind of the area right outside the whole of the ear. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1647.94s)]
*  There's a branch of the vagus nerve there. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1651.34s)]
*  There's also, as I mentioned, [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1653.06s)]
*  a branch of the vagus nerve behind the ear. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1654.06s)]
*  And were you to rub behind the ear just gently [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1655.82s)]
*  or with a little bit of pressure, [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1658.68s)]
*  indeed you're going to activate [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1660.66s)]
*  that branch of the vagus nerve. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1661.8200000000002s)]
*  That branch of the vagus nerve is carrying sensory information [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1663.6200000000001s)]
*  so that mechanical pressure is being conveyed [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1666.0600000000002s)]
*  into the brainstem. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1668.22s)]
*  And indeed that pathway satisfies all the criteria [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1669.38s)]
*  of being a parasympathetic or calming inducing pathway. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1673.02s)]
*  Now you can find all over the internet [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1676.92s)]
*  that rubbing behind the ears is really going to calm us down [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1678.46s)]
*  and really bring our level of overall autonomic arousal [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1681.8400000000001s)]
*  way, way down. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1684.8600000000001s)]
*  In reality, it doesn't bring our overall level [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1686.18s)]
*  of autonomic arousal way, way down. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1688.3000000000002s)]
*  It brings our level of autonomic arousal down a bit, [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1690.48s)]
*  depending on how active our sympathetic nervous system [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1693.56s)]
*  happens to be. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1697.6s)]
*  Why do I tell you this? [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1698.82s)]
*  Well, I'm not trying to rain on any parties out there, [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1699.66s)]
*  but the truth is if you're super stressed, [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1702.44s)]
*  if you're in a panic attack, [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1705.42s)]
*  rubbing behind your ears might help a little bit, [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1706.9s)]
*  but it's not going to suddenly bring you into a state of calm. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1709.08s)]
*  Soon we're going to talk about things [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1711.8s)]
*  that can bring you into a state of calm very fast. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1713.04s)]
*  And I will explain exactly how they work [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1715.42s)]
*  and why they work so quickly and why they are so robust. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1717.1200000000001s)]
*  I don't want to be disparaging of the area behind the ear [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1720.4s)]
*  or the area within their ear. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1722.7800000000002s)]
*  Some people really like their ears rubbed. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1723.8600000000001s)]
*  I certainly like the area behind my ears rubbed [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1725.5600000000002s)]
*  like I'm doing now or the areas within my ears [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1727.38s)]
*  gently rubbed. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1729.2s)]
*  Who doesn't like that? [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1730.0400000000002s)]
*  And indeed it's calming, [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1731.0s)]
*  but it's one minor branch of the vagus nerve [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1732.5400000000002s)]
*  carrying sensory information. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1735.92s)]
*  It's not going to suddenly shift [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1737.6200000000001s)]
*  your autonomic nervous system. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1739.16s)]
*  It's not going to suddenly tilt that seesaw [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1740.3400000000001s)]
*  into parasympathetic dominance, as it were. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1742.0800000000002s)]
*  To do that, you need to leverage some of the other [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1745.24s)]
*  more robust branches of the vagus nerve. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1747.82s)]
*  And I'll teach you how to do that in just a moment here. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1750.5s)]
*  The point is that the vagus nerve does carry [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1752.82s)]
*  sort of classic parasympathetic information. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1756.4199999999998s)]
*  If you're asked on an exam, students, med students, [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1759.06s)]
*  I don't want to be responsible for you getting this wrong. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1762.1399999999999s)]
*  I'd love to be responsible for you getting it right. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1763.98s)]
*  I teach neuroanatomy to medical students. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1765.62s)]
*  If you are asked, is cranial nerve 10, the vagus nerve, [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1767.48s)]
*  parasympathetic or sympathetic? [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1772.4199999999998s)]
*  You should answer parasympathetic. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1773.84s)]
*  If you're asked if it's sensory or motor, [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1775.9399999999998s)]
*  you should say it's mixed, it's both. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1777.68s)]
*  So it's mixed parasympathetic. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1779.5600000000002s)]
*  However, for everybody out there, med student or not, [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1780.96s)]
*  just understand that when you activate certain branches [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1784.0s)]
*  of the vagus nerve, you're either going to get [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1786.3600000000001s)]
*  an elevation in alertness, [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1788.1200000000001s)]
*  that is an increase in sympathetic nervous system activity, [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1789.8400000000001s)]
*  or a decrease in alertness, [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1792.04s)]
*  that is an elevation in parasympathetic activity, [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1794.18s)]
*  depending on which branch you activate [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1796.88s)]
*  and the context matters. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1798.64s)]
*  So if you want to relax, you can rub behind your ears, [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1800.98s)]
*  you can rub inside your ears. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1803.96s)]
*  If you have permission, you can do that to the person [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1805.64s)]
*  next to you, if they like it. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1807.4s)]
*  But it's not the case that activating any branch [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1810.3200000000002s)]
*  of the vagus nerve is going to calm us down. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1814.24s)]
*  That's simply not the case. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1816.3200000000002s)]
*  And in a moment, I'll tell you why. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1817.92s)]
*  I'd like to take a quick break [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1819.88s)]
*  and acknowledge our sponsor, AG1. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1821.0800000000002s)]
*  AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1823.8400000000001s)]

*  for almost three decades and in health and fitness [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1831.48s)]

*  physical health and performance. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1837.66s)]
*  I discovered AG1 back in 2012, [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1839.66s)]
*  long before I ever had a podcast [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1842.22s)]
*  and I've been taking it every day since. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1844.14s)]
*  I find it improves all aspects of my health, [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1846.26s)]
*  my energy, my focus, [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1848.16s)]
*  and I simply feel much better when I take it. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1849.54s)]
*  AG1 uses the highest quality ingredients [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1852.26s)]
*  in the right combinations [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1854.46s)]

*  without increasing the cost. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1857.78s)]
*  In fact, AG1 just launched their latest formula upgrade. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1859.6200000000001s)]
*  This next gen formula is based on exciting new research [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1862.9s)]
*  on the effects of probiotics on the gut microbiome. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1865.54s)]

*  Today's episode is also brought to us by Roca. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1916.5800000000002s)]
*  I'm excited to share that Roca and I recently teamed up [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1919.2s)]
*  to create a new pair of red lens glasses. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1921.54s)]
*  These red lens glasses are meant to be worn in the evening [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1924.5s)]
*  after the sun goes down. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1926.92s)]
*  They filter out short wavelength light [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1928.5s)]
*  that comes from screens and from LED lights, [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1930.18s)]
*  which are the most common indoor lighting nowadays. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1932.42s)]
*  I want to emphasize Roca red lens glasses [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1935.06s)]
*  are not traditional blue blockers. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1937.08s)]
*  They do filter out blue light, [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1939.24s)]
*  but they filter out a lot more than just blue light. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1940.6599999999999s)]
*  In fact, they filter out the full range [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1942.82s)]
*  of short wavelength light [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1944.72s)]
*  that suppresses the hormone melatonin. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1946.06s)]
*  By the way, you want melatonin high in the evening [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1947.98s)]
*  and at night, makes it easy to fall and stay asleep. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1950.24s)]
*  And the short wavelengths trigger increases in cortisol. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1952.92s)]
*  Increases in cortisol are great [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1956.84s)]
*  in the early part of the day, [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1958.4s)]
*  but you do not want increases in cortisol [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1959.6s)]
*  in the evening and at night. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1961.68s)]
*  These Roca red lens glasses ensure normal, [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1962.94s)]
*  healthy increases in melatonin [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1965.34s)]
*  and that your cortisol levels stay low, [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1967.08s)]
*  which is again, what you want in the evening and at night. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1969.28s)]
*  In doing so, these Roca red lens glasses [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1972.46s)]
*  really help you calm down [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1974.56s)]
*  and improve your transition to sleep. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1975.82s)]
*  Roca red lens glasses also look great. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1978.0s)]
*  They have a ton of different frames to select from [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1980.0s)]
*  and you can wear them out to dinner or concerts [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1981.96s)]
*  and you can still see things. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1984.28s)]
*  I don't recommend you wear them while driving [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1985.28s)]
*  just for safety purposes, [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1986.88s)]
*  but if you're out to dinner, you're at a concert, [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1988.42s)]
*  you're at a friend's house, or you're just at home, [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1990.12s)]
*  pop those Roca red lens glasses on [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1992.12s)]
*  and you'll really notice the difference [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1993.76s)]
*  in terms of your levels of calm [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1995.04s)]
*  and all the sleep stuff I mentioned earlier. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1996.68s)]
*  So it really is possible to support your biology, [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=1998.92s)]
*  be scientific about it [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2001.3s)]
*  and remain social at the same time, if you like. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2002.8s)]
*  If you'd like to try Roca, go to roca.com. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2005.86s)]
*  That's R-O-K-A.com and enter the code Huberman [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2008.68s)]
*  to save 20% off your first order. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2012.1200000000001s)]
*  Again, that's roca.com [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2014.3600000000001s)]
*  and enter the code Huberman at checkout. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2015.96s)]
*  Okay, so we've talked about all the sensory information [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2018.3600000000001s)]
*  coming in from behind the ear, [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2021.3s)]
*  from deep in the ear, from the body, [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2022.8s)]
*  coursing up past no-dose ganglion into the brainstem. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2025.8600000000001s)]
*  I told you earlier, and it's still true now, [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2030.24s)]
*  that 85% of the vagus nerve pathways are sensory in nature, [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2032.2s)]
*  carrying chemical and mechanical information. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2038.0s)]
*  So what about this other 15% of the vagus nerve [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2039.88s)]
*  that is not carrying sensory information from the body, [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2043.16s)]
*  from the head into these brainstem nuclei? [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2046.88s)]
*  By the way, when I say brainstem nuclei, [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2050.12s)]
*  I don't mean nuclei in the context of one neuron. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2052.4s)]
*  This can be a little bit confusing, [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2055.84s)]
*  but when we hear about the nucleus of a neuron, [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2057.04s)]
*  we mean the area that generally contains the DNA [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2059.76s)]
*  and we're distinguishing it from the axon [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2063.18s)]
*  and the other parts. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2065.54s)]
*  When we hear about a nucleus in the brain, [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2066.4s)]
*  these neuroanatomists should have been more creative, [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2068.96s)]
*  but when we're hearing about a nucleus in the brain, [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2070.58s)]
*  it means a collection of different neurons, [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2073.26s)]
*  so a big group of neurons. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2075.2000000000003s)]
*  So when I say brainstem nuclei, I mean a lot of neurons, [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2077.1800000000003s)]
*  thousands of neurons in little clumps there [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2079.88s)]
*  that we call nuclei. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2082.28s)]
*  So the vagus nerve includes different nuclei, [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2084.04s)]
*  different collections of neurons, [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2087.44s)]
*  and these neurons have what we call efferents, [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2090.2000000000003s)]
*  outputs to, as you might've guessed, the body, [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2092.56s)]
*  back to the various organs of the body. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2097.68s)]
*  They also have connections to things [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2099.9s)]
*  within the head and face area, [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2101.84s)]
*  but for the time being, I'm mostly going to talk about [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2104.56s)]
*  the motor outputs of the vagus nerve [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2107.32s)]
*  that come from these brainstem nuclei. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2109.68s)]
*  So these motor outputs are not themselves [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2111.86s)]
*  paying attention to mechanical or chemical information. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2114.96s)]
*  They are going to control the organs of the body. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2118.2599999999998s)]
*  This is extremely important if you want to be able [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2121.84s)]
*  to understand and leverage your vagus nerve [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2124.5s)]
*  for health and wellbeing, mental health, [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2126.7200000000003s)]
*  physical health, performance, [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2128.2400000000002s)]
*  and even for accelerated learning. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2129.82s)]
*  I guess that would fall under performance, [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2132.1200000000003s)]
*  or for recovery from different diseases. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2133.76s)]
*  There are really nice papers starting to emerge [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2135.5s)]
*  that if you can selectively activate these motor pathways, [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2137.6000000000004s)]
*  you can accelerate and increase the recovery from stroke. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2140.7200000000003s)]
*  So this is of serious significance, [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2144.84s)]
*  but for those of us that fortunately don't have strokes, [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2147.52s)]
*  it's still of serious significance, [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2150.04s)]
*  and in fact, right now, [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2151.68s)]
*  I'm going to tell you about an actionable tool [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2152.52s)]
*  whereby you can leverage one of these motor pathways [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2154.34s)]
*  to a very specific endpoint anytime you want. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2157.12s)]
*  So let's talk about how you can leverage [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2160.14s)]
*  these motor pathways of the vagus [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2161.72s)]
*  in order to what's called autoregulate. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2163.64s)]
*  Autoregulation is not just a fancy word for calming down. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2166.04s)]
*  We are going to talk about calming down, [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2169.9s)]
*  but autoregulation is the way in which your vagus nerve [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2172.02s)]
*  makes sure that that seesaw of sympathetic nervous system [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2174.62s)]
*  to parasympathetic nervous system balance [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2178.38s)]
*  doesn't get tilted too far [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2180.72s)]
*  to the side of sympathetic nervous system activation, [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2183.12s)]
*  that your levels of alertness, your heart rate, [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2186.24s)]
*  your breathing rate, et cetera, don't get too high. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2188.5s)]
*  And the reason it's called autoregulation [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2191.7999999999997s)]
*  and not just calming down is that autoregulation [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2193.7999999999997s)]
*  is something that's always happening in the background [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2196.2s)]
*  as you're going about your daily activities. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2198.7999999999997s)]
*  In fact, it's also happening while you sleep. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2200.56s)]
*  In fact, now we're going to talk about things [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2203.62s)]
*  that you can do deliberately to indeed calm down, [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2205.1s)]
*  but to also increase the amount of autoregulation [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2208.86s)]
*  that occurs during your entire day [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2211.42s)]
*  when you're not focusing on doing these particular protocols, [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2213.36s)]
*  as well as during sleep, [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2216.1s)]
*  and that will result in elevated what's called HRV [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2217.46s)]
*  or heart rate variability. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2220.9s)]
*  Now I realize that's a tall order, [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2222.82s)]
*  but what we're going to do [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2224.7000000000003s)]
*  is we're going to step through this [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2225.54s)]
*  first by focusing on the protocol. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2227.2200000000003s)]
*  And then now that you're familiar with all the business [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2229.28s)]
*  about sensory and motor and parasympathetic, [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2231.34s)]
*  now that you have all that science and nomenclature in mind, [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2234.38s)]
*  it will all make perfect sense. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2236.78s)]
*  As I described this protocol for autoregulation [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2238.56s)]
*  and improving HRV and all the protocols that follow. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2240.94s)]
*  Okay, so embedded in your brain [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2244.22s)]
*  and in your vagal nerve pathways and in your body, [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2246.24s)]
*  you have an incredible neural circuit. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2249.7999999999997s)]
*  This neural circuit is one that you are born with, [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2252.44s)]
*  and it's one that you will have your entire life. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2254.74s)]
*  This is also a pathway that you'll want to keep tuned up. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2257.58s)]
*  That is that you'll want to make sure is activated [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2260.0s)]
*  on a pretty frequent basis, [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2262.72s)]
*  super easy to do as you'll soon see, [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2264.16s)]
*  so that the pathway does not deteriorate. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2266.24s)]
*  This is a pathway that originates in an area of your brain [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2269.7999999999997s)]
*  called the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2272.7599999999998s)]
*  Now the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2275.08s)]
*  and by the way, it's the left dorsolateral [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2277.4799999999996s)]
*  prefrontal cortex in particular, [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2279.3999999999996s)]
*  sort of on the left upper part of the front of your skull. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2281.16s)]
*  If you were to go deep to that area, [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2285.8599999999997s)]
*  you would be on the left dorsal, top, lateral, side, [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2287.7999999999997s)]
*  prefrontal cortex, kind of toward the front, [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2292.62s)]
*  right behind your forehead. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2294.66s)]
*  Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex sits deep to that area. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2295.8399999999997s)]
*  The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex has outputs [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2299.72s)]
*  to a couple of other brain areas called the cingulate, [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2301.8999999999996s)]
*  called the insula. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2304.3199999999997s)]
*  You don't have to worry about those names [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2305.3799999999997s)]
*  unless you're really interested in them. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2306.52s)]
*  Those areas have communication [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2308.12s)]
*  with one of the brainstem nuclei, [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2310.58s)]
*  one of those brainstem areas that gets input [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2313.2s)]
*  from the sensory pathways from the body, [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2315.6s)]
*  from the head of the vagus, [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2319.44s)]
*  and that also contains neurons [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2322.3199999999997s)]
*  that have motor output to particular areas of your body. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2324.76s)]
*  And that brain area, and you're gonna love this, [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2328.2400000000002s)]
*  is called nucleus ambiguous. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2330.4s)]
*  I kid you not, it's called nucleus ambiguous. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2333.0600000000004s)]
*  Nucleus ambiguous contains some neurons [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2336.0600000000004s)]
*  that project down to what's called [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2339.42s)]
*  the sinoatrial node of the heart. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2341.6400000000003s)]
*  And those neurons are responsible [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2344.6400000000003s)]
*  for deceleration of heart rate. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2346.36s)]
*  And it turns out that you can selectively activate [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2349.6800000000003s)]
*  those neurons in no small part [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2351.6800000000003s)]
*  because they receive input, albeit several synapses away, [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2353.6s)]
*  from the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2357.0s)]
*  because the prefrontal cortex is involved [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2359.96s)]
*  in deliberate action, in planning and execution of action. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2362.2s)]
*  It doesn't do it alone, it does it through communication [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2366.2s)]
*  with some other brain structures, [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2368.04s)]
*  but if you, for instance, decide [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2369.64s)]
*  that you're going to activate this deceleration pathway, [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2371.58s)]
*  you can do it. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2374.2599999999998s)]
*  The beautiful thing is these neurons [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2375.48s)]
*  that also control deceleration of heart rate [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2376.98s)]
*  are active in the background. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2379.6s)]
*  They're under autonomic control, [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2380.7999999999997s)]
*  but you can take control of them. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2382.32s)]
*  When does that happen? [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2384.0s)]
*  Well, for instance, in sleep, [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2385.04s)]
*  if your heart rate starts to increase, [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2387.1200000000003s)]
*  these decelerating neurons, [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2389.56s)]
*  which are neurons of the vagus nerve, [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2390.8s)]
*  they're motor output neurons, they release acetylcholine, [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2392.36s)]
*  and they act on the sinoatrial node, [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2394.96s)]
*  which is a node within the heart that controls heart rate [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2396.92s)]
*  to slow your heart rate down. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2399.92s)]
*  This is the way in which your heart rate never gets too high. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2402.56s)]
*  The seesaw that is the autonomic nervous system, [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2405.6000000000004s)]
*  it's kind of weighted to the sympathetic nervous system side. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2408.48s)]
*  A simple example of this is if you have to stay awake, [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2411.28s)]
*  you can probably do it. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2415.2400000000002s)]
*  At some point, you'll fall asleep, [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2416.1600000000003s)]
*  but if you really want to fall asleep, [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2417.78s)]
*  it's harder to make yourself fall asleep. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2419.7200000000003s)]
*  The sympathetic nervous system is one [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2422.2400000000002s)]
*  that we can more easily leverage [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2423.96s)]
*  in order to push through things, deadlines, [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2425.5s)]
*  stay up to take care of a sick relative, [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2427.92s)]
*  push ourselves to migrate out from a dangerous place [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2430.48s)]
*  or away from a famine, [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2433.6400000000003s)]
*  another example of a dangerous place, I guess. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2434.88s)]
*  The idea here is that the sympathetic nervous system [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2436.9s)]
*  has kind of a bias towards activity. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2439.72s)]
*  And in fact, your heart rate is driven [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2441.8799999999997s)]
*  by the sympathetic nervous system, [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2444.6s)]
*  and that heart rate would continue to accelerate [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2446.08s)]
*  unless there was this deceleration pathway [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2448.6s)]
*  that every once in a while would pump the brake [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2451.12s)]
*  on heart rate. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2453.3799999999997s)]
*  And that's what this vagal pathway from nucleus ambiguous [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2454.2799999999997s)]
*  down to the sinoatrial node is doing. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2457.68s)]
*  And by the way, this deceleration of heart rate [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2460.08s)]
*  that goes from the vagus motor pathway [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2463.14s)]
*  to the sinoatrial node is the basis [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2465.56s)]
*  of what's called HRV or heart rate variability. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2468.4s)]
*  We hear a lot nowadays about heart rate variability. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2471.4s)]
*  For those of you that have heard of it, [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2473.96s)]
*  and for those of you that haven't, [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2475.2400000000002s)]
*  having a higher HRV or heart rate variability [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2476.62s)]
*  is a good thing, right? [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2479.88s)]
*  Normally, if you hear something like heart rate variability [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2481.64s)]
*  sounds like a bad thing, [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2483.48s)]
*  turns out it's a great thing. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2484.4s)]
*  Heart rate variability is essentially the distance [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2485.7200000000003s)]
*  or the time rather between beats of the heart. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2489.12s)]
*  So you might think that it's great [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2491.84s)]
*  to have a really consistent heart rate, boom, boom. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2493.12s)]
*  Or actually in reality, it's more like, boom, boom, [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2496.38s)]
*  and I'm missing some of the beats within the waveform, [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2499.46s)]
*  but you get the idea. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2502.1s)]
*  But actually it's well known to be correlated [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2503.1800000000003s)]
*  with a number of positive health outcomes, [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2505.52s)]
*  including things related to brain and body and longevity [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2508.2000000000003s)]
*  and performance to have high heart rate variability. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2511.76s)]
*  Heart rate variability is going to lead [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2514.7000000000003s)]
*  to a pattern of heartbeats that is more like, [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2517.34s)]
*  boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2519.5s)]
*  Now you might say that's arrhythmia, ah, [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2525.46s)]
*  but there are cases of arrhythmia that are good [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2528.62s)]
*  and there are cases of arrhythmia that are bad. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2531.1s)]
*  Higher HRV in general is a good thing. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2533.46s)]
*  You want it during sleep [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2537.02s)]
*  and you want it during wakeful states. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2538.44s)]
*  In sleep, heart rate variability comes about [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2540.46s)]
*  because this vagal pathway from nucleus ambiguous, [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2543.22s)]
*  so the cell bodies, the nuclei, [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2545.9s)]
*  literally the DNA within those nuclei of those neurons [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2548.38s)]
*  reside in nucleus ambiguous [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2550.66s)]
*  and they project to the sinoatrial node [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2552.22s)]
*  and every once in a while they'll just pump the brake [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2554.26s)]
*  on heart rate and slow heart rate down [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2556.7000000000003s)]
*  and then they'll come off that break, [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2558.6800000000003s)]
*  slow down, come off heart rate. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2560.1800000000003s)]
*  And here's the really beautiful part [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2562.26s)]
*  and the way that you get actionable leverage [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2563.78s)]
*  over the system. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2565.6600000000003s)]
*  The control by the vagus nerve of the sinoatrial node [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2567.42s)]
*  and heart rate is coordinated with your breathing. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2570.7000000000003s)]
*  Now, as I tell you this, it'll make perfect sense, [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2575.1800000000003s)]
*  but I just want you to step back for a minute, second [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2577.86s)]
*  and realize that these systems of the body [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2579.7400000000002s)]
*  are so elegantly coordinated. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2582.14s)]
*  And here's how it works [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2584.4s)]
*  with respect to heart rate and breathing. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2585.2999999999997s)]
*  When you inhale air, of course your lungs expand. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2587.2999999999997s)]
*  You have a muscle that sits below your lungs [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2590.98s)]
*  called the diaphragm. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2593.46s)]
*  As you inhale air, of course that diaphragm moves down. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2594.66s)]
*  Now, as your diaphragm moves down and your lungs expand, [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2598.7s)]
*  your heart literally has a bit more space [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2602.3599999999997s)]
*  in the thoracic cavity to expand. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2604.62s)]
*  Okay, it's not gonna swell massively, [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2607.98s)]
*  but it's going to expand. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2609.74s)]
*  Now, as a consequence of that expansion, [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2611.66s)]
*  the blood that's moving through your heart [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2613.5s)]
*  is going to move a little bit more slowly per unit volume. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2615.8199999999997s)]
*  That is sensed by a particular group of neurons [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2619.54s)]
*  in your heart. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2621.8999999999996s)]
*  And that sends a signal to your sympathetic nervous system [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2623.18s)]
*  to speed your heart rate up. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2626.0s)]
*  Put differently, inhaling speeds your heart rate up. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2628.64s)]
*  Now, the converse is also true. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2633.2999999999997s)]
*  When you exhale, your lungs deflate, [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2635.18s)]
*  your diaphragm moves up. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2637.2999999999997s)]
*  And as a consequence, [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2638.98s)]
*  there's slightly less space for the heart. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2639.94s)]
*  So the heart shrinks a little bit, [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2642.14s)]
*  not a ton, but it shrinks a little bit. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2644.94s)]
*  And it's enough such that whatever blood is in the heart [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2647.14s)]
*  moves through more quickly per unit volume. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2651.1s)]
*  That faster movement is sensed by neurons within the heart, [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2654.02s)]
*  sends a signal to the brain, [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2657.3s)]
*  and the brain activates those neurons [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2658.9s)]
*  within nucleus ambiguous, [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2661.02s)]
*  and very quickly sends a signal to the sinoatrial node [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2662.42s)]
*  to slow your heart rate down. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2666.02s)]
*  Put differently, exhales slow your heart rate down, [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2668.96s)]
*  and they do so by way of vagal control [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2671.92s)]
*  over the sinoatrial node. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2674.2799999999997s)]
*  This is the deceleration pathway over heart rate. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2675.88s)]
*  So as I mentioned, [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2679.56s)]
*  this is happening all the time during sleep. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2680.4s)]
*  You don't have to be consciously aware for this to happen. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2682.08s)]
*  It's a fortunate consequence of nature [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2684.84s)]
*  that the neurons within your brainstem [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2686.96s)]
*  that control breathing, [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2688.72s)]
*  and the neurons within your brainstem [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2689.72s)]
*  that control heart rate, [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2691.08s)]
*  and the other neurons within the heart itself [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2692.32s)]
*  that control heart rate, the pacemaker cells, [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2694.32s)]
*  all can function without you having to think about it. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2696.54s)]
*  That's a wonderful thing for obvious reasons. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2698.7599999999998s)]
*  It's also the case that because we have this input [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2701.08s)]
*  from the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2704.18s)]
*  down through a couple of other structures, [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2706.62s)]
*  like the cingulate and the insula, [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2708.1s)]
*  and that converge on nucleus ambiguous, [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2709.58s)]
*  if you decide to slow your heart rate down, you can do it. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2712.18s)]
*  And you do so by doing a deliberate exhale [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2715.94s)]
*  and or by increasing the intensity [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2719.62s)]
*  or the duration of your exhale. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2722.82s)]
*  So you can do that right now. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2724.94s)]
*  If you want to slow your heart rate down, [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2726.54s)]
*  that is if you want to increase [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2728.66s)]
*  parasympathetic nervous system activity, [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2730.2200000000003s)]
*  and you want to calm down fast, [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2731.98s)]
*  you can literally just, [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2733.7200000000003s)]
*  exhale, slow your heart rate down, [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2737.84s)]
*  and exhales, tilt that seesaw [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2739.78s)]
*  that is the autonomic nervous system [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2742.06s)]
*  more toward the parasympathetic side. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2744.02s)]
*  Now I've talked before on this podcast [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2746.62s)]
*  and all over social media [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2748.2200000000003s)]
*  about the so-called physiological sigh, [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2749.58s)]
*  a naturally occurring form of breathing [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2751.62s)]
*  that occurs in sleep and that we can deliberately do [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2753.54s)]
*  anytime we want to calm down fast. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2755.62s)]
*  And the physiological sigh consists of, [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2757.54s)]
*  as many of you know, two inhales through the nose, [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2759.48s)]
*  followed by a long to lungs empty exhale through the mouth. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2762.66s)]
*  Typically the first inhale is longer, [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2766.66s)]
*  again, it's done through the nose. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2768.7799999999997s)]
*  The second inhale is shorter, [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2769.8s)]
*  kind of a sharp inhale to make sure you maximally inflate [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2771.14s)]
*  all the little sacks within your lungs. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2773.94s)]
*  And then the exhale is a long, slow exhale [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2775.54s)]
*  that dumps all your air. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2779.14s)]
*  I'll just demonstrate the physiological sigh for you [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2781.46s)]
*  for those of you that haven't seen it. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2783.46s)]
*  You again, big inhale through the nose, [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2785.2200000000003s)]
*  second sharp inhale through the nose [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2787.98s)]
*  to make sure you maximally inflate the lungs [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2789.54s)]
*  and then long exhale to lungs empty, it goes like this. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2791.26s)]
*  Okay, lungs are empty. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2811.02s)]
*  That is indeed the fastest way [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2813.18s)]
*  to activate the parasympathetic nervous system [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2815.2999999999997s)]
*  and to tilt that seesaw from levels [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2817.54s)]
*  of high sympathetic nervous system activation [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2819.98s)]
*  to lower levels of sympathetic nervous system activation. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2822.8599999999997s)]
*  In fact, I immediately feel calmer. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2825.46s)]
*  Maybe you can even hear it in my voice. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2827.18s)]
*  So when you do a physiological effect, [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2828.8999999999996s)]
*  you're getting both a chemical signal into the brain, [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2830.4199999999996s)]
*  that is the adjustment of that carbon dioxide oxygen ratio. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2833.3799999999997s)]
*  It's mainly due to the offloading of carbon dioxide. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2836.7s)]
*  That lower level of carbon dioxide is registered [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2840.6s)]
*  by the brain very quickly and leads to an increase in calm. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2842.8s)]
*  The deceleration of heart rate driven by the exhale [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2846.1600000000003s)]
*  is also registered by the brain very quickly, [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2849.32s)]
*  leads to an increase in calm. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2851.36s)]
*  When you just emphasize an exhale, [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2853.2000000000003s)]
*  meaning you extend it or you make it more intense [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2855.48s)]
*  and you don't do the two inhales first, [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2858.0s)]
*  that is you don't do the physiological sigh, [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2860.1600000000003s)]
*  well, you get the mechanical signal, [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2862.52s)]
*  but you don't get the chemical signal, [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2864.36s)]
*  at least not to the same degree you do [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2866.0800000000004s)]
*  with the physiological sigh. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2867.44s)]
*  Put simply, if you want to calm down fast, [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2869.1000000000004s)]
*  ideally you do the physiological sigh. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2871.84s)]
*  However, it turns out that one of the best ways [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2874.6800000000003s)]
*  to improve your HRV, both in sleep and in wakeful states, [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2876.48s)]
*  which takes a very minimum of effort [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2880.52s)]
*  and is rarely if ever discussed, [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2882.7200000000003s)]
*  is simply throughout the day, I would say 10, 15, [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2884.8s)]
*  maybe even 20 times per day, [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2887.96s)]
*  anytime it occurs to you to just deliberately [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2889.8s)]
*  extend your exhale, that is to pump the brake [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2892.4s)]
*  on your heart rate through the vagus nerve pathway [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2894.6400000000003s)]
*  that I've been describing, just, [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2896.94s)]
*  just exhale, slow your heart rate down [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2898.8399999999997s)]
*  and then get about your normal routine. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2902.3199999999997s)]
*  You can do that essentially anytime you remember to. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2904.12s)]
*  This is literally going to increase your HRV. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2906.9s)]
*  You now know the mechanism by which it does that. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2909.68s)]
*  And get this, it will also increase your HRV [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2911.92s)]
*  in sleep at night. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2914.8399999999997s)]
*  And the reason is this pathway that originates [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2916.16s)]
*  with the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2918.8399999999997s)]
*  and goes down to nucleus ambiguous [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2920.96s)]
*  and then to the sinoatrial node of the heart [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2922.52s)]
*  because it's under conscious control [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2924.44s)]
*  and because it's subject to what we call plasticity [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2926.92s)]
*  to strengthening and to weakening. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2930.2000000000003s)]
*  That is, if you use it deliberately, it gets strengthened. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2932.56s)]
*  If you don't use it deliberately, it gets weakened. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2935.6800000000003s)]
*  Well, that's a great thing because it means [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2938.92s)]
*  that if you just simply remember to do some extended exhales [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2940.92s)]
*  throughout the day, you're going to strengthen this pathway [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2944.14s)]
*  such that it operates in the background [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2947.28s)]
*  through auto-regulation [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2949.12s)]
*  without you ever having to think about it. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2950.52s)]
*  Now, of course, that effect wears off over time. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2952.7200000000003s)]
*  If you don't occasionally remember to just do [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2954.9s)]
*  some longer exhales. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2956.86s)]
*  But this is a wonderful protocol in my opinion [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2959.06s)]
*  because it capitalizes on a inborn circuit, right? [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2961.1s)]
*  A circuit that you were born with that is already installed [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2965.06s)]
*  that you can use at any point. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2968.44s)]
*  It doesn't take any learning, [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2969.9s)]
*  but that if you just ping every once in a while [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2971.4s)]
*  with some extended exhales throughout the day, [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2973.46s)]
*  it takes essentially no time. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2975.2400000000002s)]
*  You get the benefit of feeling a little bit calmer, [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2976.7000000000003s)]
*  slowing your heart rate down and your HRV, [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2978.44s)]
*  which is correlated with a host of positive health outcomes [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2980.2200000000003s)]
*  in the short and long-term will increase. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2983.22s)]
*  Two interesting things everyone should be aware of [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2986.22s)]
*  is that as we age, of course, a number of things happen. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2988.22s)]
*  Memory gets slightly to much poorer. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2991.62s)]
*  All right, there are ways to offset that. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2994.1s)]
*  Heart rate variability gets much worse. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2996.4599999999996s)]
*  Now, an interesting finding from Nolan Williams' lab [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=2999.58s)]
*  at Stanford is that if you activate [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3002.4199999999996s)]
*  dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3004.66s)]
*  using what's called transcranial magnetic stimulation, [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3006.8999999999996s)]
*  this is a procedure where you take a stimulator [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3009.4399999999996s)]
*  and you noninvasively place it on the skull outside [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3011.82s)]
*  and just above dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3015.2400000000002s)]
*  and you stimulate through the skull [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3017.6200000000003s)]
*  dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3019.2200000000003s)]
*  you observe, as you would expect, [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3021.6200000000003s)]
*  a deceleration of heart rate, [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3023.86s)]
*  and it's known to be carried through this vagal pathway [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3025.6200000000003s)]
*  to the sinoatrial node. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3028.2200000000003s)]
*  Even after the stimulation is removed, [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3030.92s)]
*  you find that heart rate variability increases [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3033.2200000000003s)]
*  because this pathway has been stimulated [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3036.0800000000004s)]
*  into neuroplasticity, it's strengthened. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3038.3s)]
*  The other way to strengthen this pathway [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3041.54s)]
*  is to do exactly what I just described, [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3043.06s)]
*  to deliberately engage this long exhale mechanism [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3044.62s)]
*  various times throughout the day. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3047.66s)]
*  Now, if you miss a day, is the pathway going to atrophy? [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3049.3s)]
*  No. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3051.5s)]
*  If you do it 50 times a day, [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3052.34s)]
*  is it going to strengthen more [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3053.42s)]
*  than if you do it one time per day? [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3054.5s)]
*  Yes. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3056.02s)]
*  Do we know the exact thresholds of how many times per day [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3056.86s)]
*  you should be doing these deliberate exhales [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3059.0s)]
*  in order to keep this pathway robust? [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3060.6s)]
*  No, unfortunately, we do not. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3062.3s)]
*  However, we do know that in human patients [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3064.5s)]
*  that suffer atrophy of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3067.7799999999997s)]
*  that's associated with normal aging [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3070.7s)]
*  or with accelerated atrophy [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3072.58s)]
*  of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3074.7799999999997s)]
*  or lesions of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3076.18s)]
*  that tend to occur in older people who get strokes [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3078.3799999999997s)]
*  or just associated with the normal aging process, [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3081.68s)]
*  heart rate variability declines with age. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3084.06s)]
*  And it is now thought that heart rate variability [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3087.22s)]
*  declines with age, of course, [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3090.02s)]
*  in part through lower levels of physical activity, [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3091.6s)]
*  because there are, of course, [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3093.7799999999997s)]
*  certain forms of physical activity [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3094.9199999999996s)]
*  like high intensity interval training [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3096.54s)]
*  to keep that heart rate variability elevated over time [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3098.86s)]
*  using exercise. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3101.82s)]
*  But it's also true that if this pathway degenerates, [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3103.2400000000002s)]
*  you see a decrease in heart rate variability. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3106.7000000000003s)]
*  If you keep this pathway engaged [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3108.46s)]
*  by behaviorally deliberately doing these long exhales, [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3110.38s)]
*  or if you take the more robust approach [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3114.1400000000003s)]
*  of transcranial magnetic stimulation, [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3116.06s)]
*  something that most people, unfortunately, [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3117.6400000000003s)]
*  won't have the opportunity to do, [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3119.06s)]
*  although maybe in the future, [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3120.6200000000003s)]
*  there will be commercial devices [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3121.82s)]
*  that will allow us to do this, [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3122.9s)]
*  you can keep heart rate variability higher as you age, [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3124.78s)]
*  which, as I mentioned before, [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3128.7s)]
*  is correlated with a number [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3130.18s)]
*  of different positive health outcomes. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3131.62s)]
*  So these pathways by which we can tap [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3133.54s)]
*  into deliberate activation of this vagal control [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3135.3399999999997s)]
*  over the sinoatrial node are not just incidental. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3138.7s)]
*  They turn out to be central to the aging process. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3141.8199999999997s)]
*  They turn out to be central to countering the aging process. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3144.2999999999997s)]
*  And you now know you have some agency and control over them. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3147.58s)]
*  So earlier, I was talking about how, [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3151.2599999999998s)]
*  despite the fact the vagus nerve is classified [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3153.06s)]
*  as a parasympathetic nerve, [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3155.52s)]
*  that it also can be alerting. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3157.76s)]
*  It can increase levels [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3160.6000000000004s)]
*  of sympathetic nervous system activity. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3162.1600000000003s)]
*  And that runs counter to the concept of parasympathetic, [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3164.4s)]
*  which is always labeled as rest and digest. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3167.42s)]
*  I'm now going to tell you a tool that you can use [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3172.0800000000004s)]
*  when you're feeling less than energized, [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3174.36s)]
*  less than motivated, [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3176.86s)]
*  and when you need to exercise [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3178.28s)]
*  and you don't feel like doing it. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3180.48s)]
*  And when you want to leverage exercise [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3182.1200000000003s)]
*  as a way to improve brain function and plasticity. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3185.12s)]
*  It all involves the vagus nerve [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3189.12s)]
*  and it involves an aspect of the vagus nerve [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3190.88s)]
*  that very few people are aware of. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3192.96s)]
*  But in my opinion, [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3195.0s)]
*  is one of the coolest aspects of the vagus nerve. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3196.48s)]
*  It's at least as cool as vagal control [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3199.12s)]
*  over heart rate variability and auto-regulation. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3201.6s)]
*  And it goes like this. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3204.24s)]
*  There's a beautiful set of findings [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3206.88s)]
*  from a guy named Peter Strick [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3208.48s)]
*  at the University of Pittsburgh, [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3210.3199999999997s)]
*  who used these really cool methods [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3211.8399999999997s)]
*  for tracing connections between the brain and body [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3213.28s)]
*  to ask the question, [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3215.92s)]
*  what areas of the brain are communicating [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3217.28s)]
*  with our adrenal glands? [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3219.76s)]
*  Our adrenal glands are two glands [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3221.6400000000003s)]
*  that sit atop your two different kidneys. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3223.28s)]
*  So one atop each kidney and release, [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3225.38s)]
*  as the name suggests, adrenaline. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3227.88s)]
*  Adrenaline is also called epinephrine. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3230.02s)]
*  Your adrenal glands also release cortisol. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3232.32s)]
*  But for sake of this discussion, [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3234.92s)]
*  let's just think about adrenaline released [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3236.2000000000003s)]
*  from your adrenals. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3238.0400000000004s)]
*  What he found through a bunch of experiments [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3240.0400000000004s)]
*  done in non-human primates, [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3242.38s)]
*  and that seemed to correspond very well [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3244.06s)]
*  to what we observe in humans as well, [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3245.42s)]
*  is that there are three general groups of brain areas. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3247.6800000000003s)]
*  Motor activation areas, [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3251.02s)]
*  so what we call upper motor neurons. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3252.54s)]
*  So these are the neurons in the brain [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3254.42s)]
*  that control the lower motor neurons in the spinal cord [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3255.58s)]
*  that control the muscles of the body, [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3257.6400000000003s)]
*  as well as neurons within our brain [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3259.6600000000003s)]
*  that are involved in cognition and planning, [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3261.62s)]
*  and areas of the brain that are involved in emotion [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3264.2200000000003s)]
*  that can communicate with the adrenals [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3267.0s)]
*  and cause them to release adrenaline. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3269.02s)]
*  Now that's great, but it sort of points to a pathway [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3271.9s)]
*  whereby, okay, you know you should exercise. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3273.88s)]
*  You tell yourself you should exercise. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3277.3s)]
*  You're emotional about it, [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3278.98s)]
*  and your adrenals release adrenaline and you exercise. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3280.46s)]
*  Now that's interesting, [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3284.36s)]
*  but what's perhaps far more interesting [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3285.54s)]
*  is that the data from Strick Lab and other labs as well [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3288.5s)]
*  shows that when we move the large muscles of our body, [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3292.5s)]
*  the adrenals release adrenaline, epinephrine. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3296.86s)]
*  Now epinephrine has an activating [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3300.1s)]
*  sympathetic nervous system stimulatory effect, right? [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3302.8399999999997s)]
*  It tends to make the tissues of the body [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3305.52s)]
*  that are associated with movement [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3307.42s)]
*  and with so-called fight or flight, [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3308.94s)]
*  although again, fight or flight is kind of an extreme example. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3310.8199999999997s)]
*  It tends to activate the organs of the body [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3314.66s)]
*  and make them more likely to be active. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3317.06s)]
*  It increases the probability that movement will occur, [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3319.18s)]
*  overall body movement. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3322.7799999999997s)]
*  So when we move the large muscles of our body, our legs, [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3324.46s)]
*  and in particular our trunk muscles, [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3327.02s)]
*  we release adrenaline, [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3328.66s)]
*  that adrenaline activates the organs of our body [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3330.7s)]
*  and further makes it likely [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3333.3399999999997s)]
*  that we're going to move our musculature more. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3334.8199999999997s)]
*  But get this, [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3337.5s)]
*  adrenaline, epinephrine doesn't cross the blood-brain barrier. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3338.72s)]
*  So how does it increase our level of alertness [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3342.18s)]
*  in our brain, right? [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3344.3799999999997s)]
*  You don't want your body to be super active [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3345.54s)]
*  and your brain to be kind of sleepy. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3347.22s)]
*  That's not good. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3348.8599999999997s)]
*  That's not adaptive. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3349.74s)]
*  Turns out that when the adrenals release adrenaline, [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3351.5s)]
*  it binds to receptors on the vagus nerve itself, [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3355.06s)]
*  those sensory axons that extend into the body. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3358.26s)]
*  There are receptors on those wires, right? [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3361.82s)]
*  Not all the receptors are at one end or the other. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3363.98s)]
*  They're also on those axons. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3365.78s)]
*  The adrenaline binds to the receptors on those axons [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3368.38s)]
*  and the vagus nerve in turn releases glutamate, [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3370.82s)]
*  an excitatory neurotransmitter, [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3375.38s)]
*  in a structure in the brain called [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3377.38s)]
*  the nucleus tractus solitaris. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3378.6600000000003s)]
*  The neurons in what I'm just going to call the NTS [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3381.3s)]
*  for simplicity, [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3383.34s)]
*  in turn activate neurons in a brain structure [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3384.9s)]
*  called the locus coeruleus. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3387.9s)]
*  The locus coeruleus contains neurons [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3390.06s)]
*  that release what's called norepinephrine. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3392.02s)]
*  And the neurons of locus coeruleus send their axons out [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3394.82s)]
*  very extensively across the brain [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3397.78s)]
*  in kind of a sprinkler system-like organization, [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3399.7400000000002s)]
*  such that when you move the large musculature of your body, [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3402.7400000000002s)]
*  you release adrenaline. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3406.32s)]
*  That adrenaline activates the tissues of your body, [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3407.9s)]
*  makes them more likely to move, [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3410.2200000000003s)]
*  also binds to receptors on the vagus. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3411.58s)]
*  The vagus nerve in turn releases glutamate, [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3413.82s)]
*  an excitatory neurotransmitter in the NTS. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3416.06s)]
*  The NTS then passes off that excitatory signal [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3418.58s)]
*  like a bucket brigade off to the locus coeruleus. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3421.84s)]
*  The locus coeruleus dumps a bunch of norepinephrine [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3424.82s)]
*  into the brain and increases your levels of alertness. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3427.58s)]
*  What this means is that the vagus nerve [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3430.7s)]
*  is central to the process of using physical activity [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3433.14s)]
*  to make your brain more alert. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3436.46s)]
*  And we know that activation of locus coeruleus [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3438.58s)]
*  makes the brain areas that are involved in motivation [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3441.24s)]
*  and the propensity to move more, [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3444.54s)]
*  higher in levels of activity. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3447.02s)]
*  In other words, if you're not feeling motivated to exercise [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3449.34s)]
*  or you're not feeling alert enough, [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3452.38s)]
*  movement of the body that includes especially the legs, [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3454.86s)]
*  the large muscles of the legs, [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3457.34s)]
*  so quadriceps, hamstrings, et cetera, [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3458.58s)]
*  as well as the trunk muscles of the body, [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3460.5s)]
*  stimulate this pathway in a kind of dominoing effect [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3462.7799999999997s)]
*  that makes the likelihood and believe it or not, [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3466.46s)]
*  the desire to move much more likely. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3469.7s)]
*  This I've personally found to be an immensely useful [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3473.32s)]
*  piece of information because sure, [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3476.92s)]
*  I knew that sometimes I would go to the gym [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3479.3s)]
*  or I'd head out on a run and I wasn't feeling motivated [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3481.48s)]
*  or I'd sit down to do some work and I'd feel kind of sleepy [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3484.6400000000003s)]
*  despite the fact that I'd slept pretty well the night before [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3487.1200000000003s)]
*  and eating just fine and the room wasn't too warm, et cetera. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3489.0800000000004s)]
*  I feel kind of lethargic and I was like, [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3492.28s)]
*  what's going on here? [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3493.6400000000003s)]
*  And yes, I had the experience of sometimes, [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3495.42s)]
*  doing a bit of a warmup, maybe some light calisthenics, [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3498.88s)]
*  maybe a few warmup sets or jogging for a little while [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3501.32s)]
*  and then finding that my levels of alertness increased. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3503.84s)]
*  But I've also had just as often the experience [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3506.36s)]
*  of not feeling that motivation for physical activity [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3508.6400000000003s)]
*  or for cognitive activity come online, [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3512.86s)]
*  especially if I wasn't extremely interested in that activity [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3515.2000000000003s)]
*  or that thing that I was supposed to learn. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3518.0800000000004s)]
*  It's very easy to be excited when we want to do the activity [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3520.1200000000003s)]
*  or we want to learn the thing that we're supposed to be [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3522.88s)]
*  learning at a given moment or reading at a given moment. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3524.96s)]
*  This pathway is immensely useful to understand [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3527.52s)]
*  because it explains why it is that [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3530.5s)]
*  even when you're not feeling motivated, [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3532.24s)]
*  if you do some activity that, yes, [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3533.86s)]
*  is preceded by a bit of a warmup. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3536.12s)]
*  So maybe, I don't know, you do some light calisthenics [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3537.7s)]
*  or you go on the treadmill for a few minutes walking [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3539.66s)]
*  and maybe a little bit faster, [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3541.46s)]
*  that it can increase your levels of alertness [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3542.88s)]
*  and motivation. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3545.02s)]
*  But it especially explains how if you put in some effort [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3546.2s)]
*  that at the moment feels like a big exertion, [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3551.06s)]
*  your entire body and brain state shifts [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3554.26s)]
*  in a way that levels of motivation and energy [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3557.22s)]
*  to do more physical work or more cognitive work or both [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3559.58s)]
*  increases dramatically. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3563.2999999999997s)]
*  And these are not small effects when they've been measured. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3564.58s)]
*  In fact, for all the talk that's out there [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3566.88s)]
*  in kind of pop psychology and in kind of pop neuroscience [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3569.7s)]
*  about the vagus being a calming pathway, [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3573.72s)]
*  all the neurophysiologists out there, [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3577.66s)]
*  and I know there aren't very many, [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3579.46s)]
*  but I'm friends with a lot of neurophysiologists, [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3580.8199999999997s)]
*  they'll all tell you that if they're doing a surgery [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3583.42s)]
*  or they're doing some sort of brain recording [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3586.46s)]
*  and the animal or person that they're doing [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3588.86s)]
*  the brain recording from is starting to drop into a state [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3590.6400000000003s)]
*  of deep parasympathetic activity, [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3594.06s)]
*  they're falling asleep or they need to be more alert, [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3596.3s)]
*  what do they do? [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3598.6200000000003s)]
*  They stimulate the vagus. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3599.46s)]
*  They stimulate the vagus nerve in order to wake up [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3601.1400000000003s)]
*  the brain. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3603.34s)]
*  In fact, stimulating the vagus has been used [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3604.1800000000003s)]
*  to save people's lives when they are drifting too far down [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3605.92s)]
*  into deeper and deeper planes of anesthesia. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3609.38s)]
*  So stimulating the vagus wakes up the brain. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3612.2200000000003s)]
*  And the way to stimulate the vagus is by way [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3615.1400000000003s)]
*  of these receptors on the vagus nerve itself. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3617.54s)]
*  And the way to do that without an electrical stimulator, [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3619.62s)]
*  because we're not talking about clinical conditions here, [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3622.42s)]
*  in order to increase levels of motivation, [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3624.18s)]
*  alertness and focus for physical activity [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3626.5s)]
*  or cognitive activity and learning, et cetera, [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3628.58s)]
*  or simply to overcome lethargy and brain fog [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3631.06s)]
*  is to do some sort of physical activity [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3633.7s)]
*  that includes the large musculature of your body. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3635.58s)]
*  These could be things like jumping, [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3637.7799999999997s)]
*  these could be things like actual resistance training, [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3639.86s)]
*  this could be running. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3642.58s)]
*  This information really points to the idea [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3644.5s)]
*  of course, after a good warmup, [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3647.3799999999997s)]
*  doing more sprinting type activity, [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3649.58s)]
*  more strength type activity, you know, [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3651.8999999999996s)]
*  six repetitions or less where you're getting close to fail [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3654.22s)]
*  or this sort of thing to wake up the brain and body [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3656.74s)]
*  as opposed to doing long rhythmic activity [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3659.3199999999997s)]
*  that's below the threshold of what would activate [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3662.1s)]
*  a lot of adrenaline from the adrenals. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3664.22s)]
*  So the idea is to get those adrenals to release adrenaline [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3666.1s)]
*  into your system. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3668.74s)]
*  It won't cross the blood brain barrier, [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3669.56s)]
*  but your vagus nerve provides this beautiful link [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3671.06s)]
*  between the body and brain to match levels of excitation [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3673.9s)]
*  from the body to the brain and you can leverage that. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3677.14s)]
*  In addition, there's also the well-described effects [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3680.02s)]
*  and I've done an entire episode about this [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3683.26s)]
*  of how exercise can improve brain plasticity [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3685.6600000000003s)]
*  and the ability to learn. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3688.1800000000003s)]
*  And while there are a host of mechanisms [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3689.58s)]
*  involving long-term changes in things [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3691.46s)]
*  like brain-derived nootrophic factor [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3693.14s)]
*  and increases in lactate, [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3695.62s)]
*  which might open the door to plasticity [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3696.98s)]
*  and so on and so forth, [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3698.62s)]
*  it does seem that one of the major ways [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3700.1s)]
*  that exercise improves our brain function [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3703.54s)]
*  and our ability to learn [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3705.86s)]
*  is simply by increasing our levels of alertness. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3707.58s)]
*  Then I should say the word simply placed in there [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3710.54s)]
*  is probably a bit unfair. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3713.0s)]
*  There is absolutely nothing trivial about using exercise [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3714.54s)]
*  as a way to stimulate a sort of cascade [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3717.52s)]
*  of this neural circuit from the adrenals [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3719.82s)]
*  up the vagus and into locus coeruleus [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3721.34s)]
*  in order to wake up your brain networks [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3723.7s)]
*  that are involved in motivation, focus and learning. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3725.52s)]
*  As we'll talk about in a few minutes, [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3728.72s)]
*  many of us, most of us perhaps, [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3729.94s)]
*  are used to using pharmacology like caffeine [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3732.18s)]
*  or other stimulants in order to try and wake up levels [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3734.62s)]
*  of alertness in the brain. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3736.94s)]
*  And I'm not being disparaging of that. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3737.8199999999997s)]
*  I am an avid consumer of caffeine [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3739.74s)]
*  in the form of Yerba Mate or coffee. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3741.7s)]
*  I'll occasionally take an alpha GPC [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3743.66s)]
*  or an L-tyrosine as well. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3746.22s)]
*  I do all those things. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3747.7799999999997s)]
*  However, in my opinion, [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3748.94s)]
*  it's far more powerful to be able to leverage, [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3750.58s)]
*  that is to activate these levels of alertness [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3752.8599999999997s)]
*  in your brain and body [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3755.16s)]
*  in a way that doesn't require any pharmacology [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3756.3599999999997s)]
*  if you don't have it available to you [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3758.4199999999996s)]
*  or you're trying to avoid pharmacology [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3759.64s)]
*  or you're working out late at night [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3761.22s)]
*  or you want to focus later at night. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3762.2999999999997s)]
*  You don't want to be kept awake by the caffeine [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3764.3599999999997s)]
*  or even if you consume caffeine or other stimulants. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3766.7799999999997s)]
*  Knowing the organization of these neural circuits [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3769.3399999999997s)]
*  from the body to the brain [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3771.4199999999996s)]
*  and how they match levels of alertness [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3772.3399999999997s)]
*  and leveraging them is so straightforward, [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3773.8199999999997s)]
*  but most people don't actually get to the point [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3776.58s)]
*  where they're doing that high intensity work [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3779.06s)]
*  or they're doing the work [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3780.7s)]
*  that involves the large musculature of their body [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3782.2999999999997s)]
*  when they're feeling not motivated. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3783.9199999999996s)]
*  In fact, they usually do the opposite thing. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3785.9199999999996s)]
*  Now, sometimes you need rest days. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3787.54s)]
*  This is true, right? [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3788.9399999999996s)]
*  You need to rest and recover to make progress. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3789.78s)]
*  You don't want to exhaust yourself. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3791.6600000000003s)]
*  You need to get sleep. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3792.82s)]
*  You need to take care of yourself. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3793.6600000000003s)]
*  However, the reason we're talking about this [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3795.2400000000002s)]
*  is it's a beautiful opportunity to A, [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3796.76s)]
*  explain that the vagus nerve is not just about calming down. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3799.6000000000004s)]
*  It's actually actively used to wake up your brain [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3803.1000000000004s)]
*  when your body is active, [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3806.2200000000003s)]
*  when the large musculature of your body is active. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3807.98s)]
*  And B, that like with auto-regulation, [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3810.26s)]
*  this stuff is under conscious control. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3814.6600000000003s)]
*  Yes, if you were to be frightened immediately, [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3817.58s)]
*  this is the same pathway [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3819.98s)]
*  that would be reflexively activated by an intruder [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3821.04s)]
*  or by a big explosion or something of that sort. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3823.42s)]
*  Your body would wake up, release adrenaline, [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3825.7799999999997s)]
*  then that adrenaline would set up along this cascade [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3827.68s)]
*  and your mind would be immediately alert as well. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3830.54s)]
*  There's some parallel mechanisms too, [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3832.38s)]
*  to make sure that your brain [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3834.08s)]
*  and your body are alert immediately. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3835.02s)]
*  But when you start to understand what these pathways are [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3837.2999999999997s)]
*  and that they're very specific and very powerful, [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3840.02s)]
*  potent inroads into activating these circuits, [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3842.7799999999997s)]
*  it does indeed give you a tremendous amount of agency, [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3846.06s)]
*  especially for those of you that might think [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3849.54s)]
*  you're not motivated to exercise [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3851.44s)]
*  or you're always lethargic or you have brain fog. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3852.7999999999997s)]
*  There might be other reasons for that, [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3854.9s)]
*  but for many people, [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3856.84s)]
*  chances are you're not getting past that threshold [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3858.2599999999998s)]
*  whereby these circuits involving the vagus [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3861.04s)]
*  can be activated and now you know how. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3863.1s)]
*  So activate them. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3865.46s)]
*  I'd like to take a quick break [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3866.94s)]
*  and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Function. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3868.18s)]
*  Last year, I became a Function member [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3870.96s)]
*  after searching for the most comprehensive approach [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3872.54s)]
*  to lab testing. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3874.86s)]

*  This snapshot offers you with insights on your heart health, [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3882.7200000000003s)]
*  hormone health, immune functioning, [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3885.26s)]
*  nutrient levels and much more. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3887.3s)]
*  They've also recently added tests for toxins [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3889.38s)]
*  such as BPA exposure from harmful plastics [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3891.42s)]
*  and tests for PFASs or forever chemicals. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3894.06s)]
*  Function not only provides testing [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3896.98s)]
*  of over a hundred biomarkers key [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3898.56s)]
*  to your physical and mental health, [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3900.1s)]
*  but it also analyzes these results [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3901.82s)]
*  and provides insights from top doctors [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3903.66s)]
*  who are expert in the relevant areas. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3905.8199999999997s)]
*  For example, in one of my first tests with Function, [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3907.8999999999996s)]
*  I learned that I had elevated levels of mercury in my blood. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3910.58s)]
*  Function not only helped me detect that, [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3913.7s)]
*  but offered insights into how best [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3915.68s)]
*  to reduce my mercury levels, [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3917.18s)]
*  which included limiting my tuna consumption. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3918.7s)]
*  I'd been eating a lot of tuna [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3921.08s)]
*  while also making an effort to eat more leafy greens [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3922.5s)]
*  and supplementing with NAC and acetylcysteine, [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3924.7s)]
*  both of which can support glutathione production [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3927.06s)]
*  and detoxification. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3929.1s)]
*  And I should say by taking a second Function test, [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3930.54s)]
*  that approach worked. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3933.08s)]
*  Comprehensive blood testing is vitally important. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3934.08s)]
*  There's so many things related to your mental [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3936.56s)]
*  and physical health that can only be detected [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3938.46s)]
*  in a blood test. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3940.98s)]
*  The problem is blood testing has always been very expensive [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3942.12s)]
*  and complicated. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3944.52s)]
*  In contrast, I've been super impressed [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3945.54s)]
*  by Function's simplicity and at the level of cost. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3947.2799999999997s)]
*  It is very affordable. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3950.52s)]
*  As a consequence, I decided to join [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3951.7999999999997s)]
*  their scientific advisory board, [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3953.44s)]
*  and I'm thrilled that they're sponsoring the podcast. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3954.96s)]
*  If you'd like to try Function, [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3957.62s)]
*  you can go to functionhealth.com slash Huberman. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3958.96s)]
*  Function currently has a wait list of over 250,000 people, [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3961.92s)]
*  but they're offering early access [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3965.04s)]
*  to Huberman podcast listeners. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3967.16s)]
*  Again, that's functionhealth.com slash Huberman [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3968.84s)]
*  to get early access to Function. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3972.1s)]
*  I just got done telling you [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3974.2400000000002s)]
*  how you can increase your levels of alertness [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3975.2000000000003s)]
*  by activating this vagal nerve pathway [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3977.12s)]
*  from the body to the brain. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3978.86s)]
*  And that increasing your level of alertness [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3980.28s)]
*  allows for more opportunity to focus and to learn. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3982.84s)]
*  But when we say focus and learn, [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3986.04s)]
*  what we're really talking about is neuroplasticity, [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3987.3s)]
*  this incredible feature of your nervous system [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3989.76s)]
*  to be able to change in response to experience [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3992.42s)]
*  in deliberate ways. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3994.44s)]
*  The plasticity that you have when you are a child [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3995.6800000000003s)]
*  from the time you're born until about age 25, [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=3998.2000000000003s)]
*  typically can occur even in passive experience. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4001.7400000000002s)]
*  That is, you're in class, [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4004.96s)]
*  a teacher's teaching you something, [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4006.6800000000003s)]
*  your brain is changing. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4007.96s)]
*  Maybe you put a bit more effort into something, [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4009.1600000000003s)]
*  you're focused, your brain will change. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4010.86s)]
*  But as we get into adulthood, [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4013.4s)]
*  most of our neural maps in the brain, [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4015.44s)]
*  certainly our sensory maps and our cortex, [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4017.2000000000003s)]
*  our motor maps that allow us to move in particular ways, [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4019.16s)]
*  those have been established. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4023.02s)]
*  You can still change them, [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4024.42s)]
*  but they've mostly been established throughout childhood [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4026.08s)]
*  and into our early 20s. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4028.6s)]
*  And if we want to modify those circuits [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4029.92s)]
*  with neuroplasticity, [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4031.5s)]
*  there are a couple of key requirements. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4032.8799999999997s)]
*  One, you need to be alert. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4034.2s)]
*  You can't get neuroplasticity. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4036.04s)]
*  That is, you can't trigger neuroplasticity [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4037.52s)]
*  unless you're alert. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4039.96s)]
*  You also have to be focused. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4040.8799999999997s)]
*  This is critical and differentiates adult plasticity [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4042.3599999999997s)]
*  in a major way from plasticity when we're young [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4045.08s)]
*  where we can learn by passive exposure. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4047.4s)]
*  Okay. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4049.96s)]
*  When we're young, we can learn by passive exposure [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4050.8s)]
*  or even better by focused exposure. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4052.4s)]
*  But when we are adults, we need alertness [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4055.08s)]
*  and we need focus. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4057.2000000000003s)]
*  Just passively being exposed to music or to a motor pattern [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4058.56s)]
*  is not going to allow us to change our nervous system. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4063.6800000000003s)]
*  That's been shown over and over again. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4065.7200000000003s)]
*  Fortunately, what also has been shown over and over again [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4067.36s)]
*  is that if we are alert and we're focused [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4070.7400000000002s)]
*  and we are determined, [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4072.92s)]
*  especially if we undertake what's called [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4074.0s)]
*  incremental learning where we go after small bits [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4075.52s)]
*  of neuroplasticity repeatedly over time, [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4079.0s)]
*  we can get as much neuroplasticity [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4081.86s)]
*  as one observes in childhood. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4084.0s)]
*  It just takes longer [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4085.84s)]
*  and you have to do it so-called incrementally. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4087.0s)]
*  There's a lot to say about that, [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4090.16s)]
*  but for sake of today's discussion about the vagus nerve, [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4091.7599999999998s)]
*  I just want to tell you that [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4094.56s)]
*  there's a particular pathway in the brain [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4096.2s)]
*  that involves the molecule acetylcholine. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4099.02s)]
*  Acetylcholine is used to contract the muscles. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4101.92s)]
*  It's released from motor neurons in the spinal cord [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4104.8s)]
*  onto muscles to contract the muscles. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4107.2s)]
*  It's also used in the brain [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4109.0s)]
*  and elsewhere in the nervous system [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4110.5s)]
*  and it does a lot of different things. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4111.8s)]
*  It's actually involved in generating [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4113.18s)]
*  the rhythms of the heart. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4114.76s)]
*  But acetylcholine released from a particular nucleus [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4116.320000000001s)]
*  in the brain called nucleus basalis. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4119.68s)]
*  The acetylcholine released from nucleus basalis [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4122.06s)]
*  is what we call permissive for plasticity. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4124.92s)]
*  In other words, [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4127.820000000001s)]
*  if you have acetylcholine released from nucleus basalis [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4128.66s)]
*  into the brain, [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4131.26s)]
*  plasticity is much more likely to occur. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4132.48s)]
*  And in fact, acetylcholine released from nucleus basalis [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4135.48s)]
*  is sort of like a gate, [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4139.2s)]
*  whereby if you release acetylcholine, [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4140.58s)]
*  the opportunity for neuroplasticity and learning [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4142.639999999999s)]
*  is available for some period of time. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4145.339999999999s)]
*  So the question therefore becomes, [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4147.44s)]
*  how do you get acetylcholine released from nucleus basalis? [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4148.879999999999s)]
*  There are these incredible experiments [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4151.62s)]
*  that have been done by Mike Merzenich and colleagues [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4153.04s)]
*  showing that if you stimulate nucleus basalis [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4155.959999999999s)]
*  to release acetylcholine and you expose an animal [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4158.2s)]
*  or a human to a particular sensory stimulus, [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4160.56s)]
*  the brain remaps very fast according to that experience, [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4163.02s)]
*  just enormous amounts of plasticity [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4166.76s)]
*  that you wouldn't observe otherwise. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4168.56s)]
*  There are also fortunately experiments showing [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4170.38s)]
*  that if you pharmacologically increase acetylcholine, [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4172.780000000001s)]
*  that you can enhance the opportunity for neuroplasticity. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4176.18s)]
*  You still need to do the learning. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4179.080000000001s)]
*  You still need to attempt to learn something. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4180.84s)]
*  You still have to make it incremental, [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4182.34s)]
*  but the amount of plasticity is significantly increased [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4184.04s)]
*  when there's acetylcholine released from nucleus basalis. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4187.4s)]
*  So in the absence of deep brain stimulation [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4190.679999999999s)]
*  using an electrode, which most of you fortunately [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4193.48s)]
*  will not experience because it requires drilling down [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4195.96s)]
*  through the skull and placing an electrode in basalis, [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4198.28s)]
*  and assuming that you're not taking anything [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4201.12s)]
*  to increase acetylcholine transmission to learn, [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4203.5199999999995s)]
*  although there are ways to do that. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4205.799999999999s)]
*  I've talked about that before, [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4207.639999999999s)]
*  and I'll talk about that again in a future podcast. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4208.82s)]
*  Some of those ways include supplementing [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4211.0199999999995s)]
*  with things like alpha GPC, [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4213.12s)]
*  which is a precursor to acetylcholine. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4214.48s)]
*  There are some other precursors to acetylcholine [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4217.12s)]
*  or things that stimulate the release of acetylcholine, [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4219.08s)]
*  such as Hooperzine and things like that, [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4221.36s)]
*  that will open the opportunity for enhanced plasticity [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4223.36s)]
*  for a few hours. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4226.04s)]
*  And there is good old nicotine. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4227.38s)]
*  I know the word nicotine brings to mind [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4230.5199999999995s)]
*  things like lung cancer because for many, many years, [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4233.16s)]
*  many, many people and still now, [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4236.16s)]
*  smoked nicotine in the form of cigarettes or vaping, [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4237.68s)]
*  both of which I think are absolutely terrible [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4240.24s)]
*  as is dipping and snuffing, [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4242.0s)]
*  because yes, they increase levels [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4243.84s)]
*  of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor activation, [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4245.84s)]
*  which is just fancy nerd speak [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4248.74s)]
*  for acetylcholine transmission in the brain [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4250.56s)]
*  is enhanced by nicotine. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4252.72s)]
*  But those delivery mechanisms also, of course, [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4254.64s)]
*  can give you cancer in the case of smoking, [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4257.04s)]
*  dipping or snuffing and vaping, [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4259.32s)]
*  despite what you hear out there, [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4261.28s)]
*  is absolutely terrible for your health. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4262.52s)]
*  I don't care what anybody says. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4265.2s)]
*  The evidence is starting to really pile up [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4266.400000000001s)]
*  that vaping is bad for you. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4268.9800000000005s)]
*  Now, is oral form nicotine bad for you? [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4270.18s)]
*  In the form of gum or in the form of a pouch, et cetera. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4273.72s)]
*  I just want to say a couple of things. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4276.64s)]
*  One, it's extremely habit forming. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4278.72s)]
*  Two, it increases blood pressure [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4281.68s)]
*  and it's a vasoconstrictor. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4284.4800000000005s)]
*  These drawbacks about nicotine are real [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4286.12s)]
*  and are critical to consider [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4288.320000000001s)]
*  if you're going to use nicotine as a focusing agent [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4290.0s)]
*  or a so-called nootropic. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4292.38s)]
*  I don't really like that word, [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4293.88s)]
*  but if you're using nicotine as a way [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4295.38s)]
*  to enhance cognition and enhance neuroplasticity, [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4297.8s)]
*  you should know what the potential drawbacks are. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4301.28s)]
*  Most notably the habit forming and addicting properties, [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4303.679999999999s)]
*  which are very robust. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4306.48s)]
*  Now, with that said, [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4308.2s)]
*  there are ways to non-pharmacologically stimulate [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4309.08s)]
*  the nucleus basalis acetylcholine pathway [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4312.16s)]
*  to enhance the window for plasticity. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4314.719999999999s)]
*  And the way to do that is, you guessed it, [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4316.8s)]
*  through the vagus nerve. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4319.28s)]
*  Studies in healthy humans and humans [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4320.96s)]
*  who have had, for instance, stroke, [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4322.88s)]
*  as well as animal studies have shown [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4324.759999999999s)]
*  that if you stimulate the vagus nerve electrically, [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4326.44s)]
*  you increase the level of alertness in the brain. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4329.28s)]
*  And part of the mechanism by which you do that [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4331.719999999999s)]
*  is the one I told you about a few minutes ago, [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4333.7s)]
*  the adrenals, vagus, locus coeruleus, [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4336.12s)]
*  but also there's a separate pathway from the NTS [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4338.24s)]
*  to nucleus basalis that stimulates the release [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4342.0s)]
*  of acetylcholine from nucleus basalis [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4344.54s)]
*  and opens up the opportunity for neuroplasticity. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4346.759999999999s)]
*  This I should mention is not a small effect. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4350.7s)]
*  It is a rapid effect. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4354.099999999999s)]
*  And it's one that has allowed stroke patients, for instance, [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4356.12s)]
*  to improve their motor capabilities very quickly [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4359.12s)]
*  as compared to when the vagus nerve is not stimulated [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4361.64s)]
*  or when acetylcholine transmission [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4364.92s)]
*  is not enhanced pharmacologically. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4366.64s)]
*  And fortunately now, there are studies starting [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4368.44s)]
*  to accumulate in animal models and some in humans. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4371.0s)]
*  We need more, but there are some showing [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4374.98s)]
*  that if you enhance alertness by way [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4377.12s)]
*  of activating the vagus nerve through the mechanism [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4379.599999999999s)]
*  that I told you before, which is good old fashioned, [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4382.68s)]
*  high intensity exercise, that in the several hours [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4385.0599999999995s)]
*  following that exercise, there is an enhanced opportunity [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4388.32s)]
*  for neuroplasticity. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4392.12s)]
*  Now that enhanced opportunity for neuroplasticity comes [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4393.58s)]
*  by way of two different pathways. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4396.639999999999s)]
*  You already heard about the first one, [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4398.4s)]
*  which is the locus coeruleus release of norepinephrine. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4400.0s)]
*  That's going to increase alertness, [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4402.84s)]
*  which is a prerequisite for focus. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4404.9s)]
*  And it appears to be the case that the release [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4407.36s)]
*  of acetylcholine from nucleus basalis that's also triggered [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4409.16s)]
*  by this high intensity exercise is what allows [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4413.08s)]
*  for that alertness to be converted into focus. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4416.32s)]
*  And those two things together, alertness and focus [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4419.639999999999s)]
*  are the triggers for adult neuroplasticity. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4422.28s)]
*  If you think about this, this is really exciting. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4425.12s)]
*  For 25 years or more, we've known that plasticity [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4427.5599999999995s)]
*  is possible in the adult human. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4430.38s)]
*  We knew you needed alertness and you needed focus. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4432.38s)]
*  We also, by the way, know that you need to get great sleep [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4435.04s)]
*  that night and in subsequent nights in order [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4438.24s)]
*  to actually allow the plasticity to occur. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4440.599999999999s)]
*  Plasticity is a process. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4443.04s)]
*  It's not just triggered when you go about trying [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4444.54s)]
*  to learn something, it actually takes place in sleep, [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4446.46s)]
*  as well as sleep-like states like non-sleep deep rest [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4449.54s)]
*  and meditation, but especially in deep sleep [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4452.3s)]
*  and rapid eye movement sleep. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4455.06s)]
*  This is why you can attempt to learn something cognitively [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4456.44s)]
*  or behaviorally over and over and over. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4458.68s)]
*  You can't get those scales on the piano right. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4461.34s)]
*  You can't get the information dialed in from your class, [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4462.98s)]
*  a language class or from engineering, [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4467.58s)]
*  or you're trying to figure out what this picture should be [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4469.84s)]
*  in your mind that you're going to paint, et cetera. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4472.58s)]
*  You work at it, you work at it, you work at it. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4475.26s)]
*  You sleep, you sleep, and then one day you wake up [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4477.26s)]
*  and suddenly you have the skill. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4479.0199999999995s)]
*  It's because the actual rewiring of those circuits [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4480.3s)]
*  that we call neuroplasticity occurs during sleep, [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4483.0599999999995s)]
*  but it's triggered in those moments of incremental learning [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4485.28s)]
*  and really struggling. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4488.7s)]
*  And keep in mind the struggle to learn something, [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4489.62s)]
*  that friction is part of the neuroplasticity process. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4491.74s)]
*  And it's oh so clear now that alertness and focus [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4495.26s)]
*  are the prerequisites for plasticity, [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4499.74s)]
*  that alertness is coming in large part [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4502.02s)]
*  by way of the release of norepinephrine from locus coeruleus, [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4504.5s)]
*  that the focus is being augmented, [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4507.64s)]
*  and perhaps it's even originating entirely [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4509.9400000000005s)]
*  from the release of acetylcholine and nucleus basalis [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4512.540000000001s)]
*  that acts as sort of a spotlight on a particular set [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4515.1s)]
*  of things that are happening while we're trying to learn. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4517.540000000001s)]
*  And then that triggers the plasticity process [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4520.580000000001s)]
*  which takes place during sleep. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4523.1s)]
*  So that beautiful picture of self-directed adaptive [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4525.3s)]
*  plasticity in adulthood is allowed to happen [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4528.86s)]
*  because the vagus nerve in part is triggering NTS [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4533.38s)]
*  to say, hey, locus coeruleus, nucleus basalis, wake up, [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4539.0599999999995s)]
*  release norepinephrine, release acetylcholine, [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4542.9s)]
*  now's the time to learn. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4545.9s)]
*  So what this means is if you're struggling to learn, [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4547.46s)]
*  if you want to continue to have robust neuroplasticity, [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4550.139999999999s)]
*  if you happen to have some damage to motor pathways [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4553.099999999999s)]
*  or you're having trouble with focusing and brain fog, [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4556.38s)]
*  keep in mind, focus itself is served by a circuit [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4558.62s)]
*  that is subject to plasticity. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4562.5s)]
*  You can actually get better at focusing [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4563.94s)]
*  by working on focus just the same way you would [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4566.18s)]
*  on any skill. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4568.42s)]
*  And so if you're struggling with focus, [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4570.099999999999s)]
*  I highly recommend finding a threshold of exercise [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4571.9s)]
*  that stimulates brain alertness, [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4574.86s)]
*  that triggers these pathways that are now starting [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4577.3s)]
*  to be clear that they occur from the literature [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4579.54s)]
*  in animals and humans. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4582.54s)]
*  And yes, you might augment this with something like caffeine [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4584.42s)]
*  which will further increase levels of norepinephrine. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4587.5s)]
*  You might even use low dose nicotine. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4590.38s)]
*  I'm not necessarily recommending that, [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4592.14s)]
*  certainly not for young people. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4593.58s)]
*  And you do need to be aware of the habit forming, [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4595.14s)]
*  AKA addictive properties of nicotine. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4597.7s)]
*  You definitely don't want to consume it in any form [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4599.78s)]
*  that's going to cause you to increase your risk of cancer [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4601.86s)]
*  or popcorn lung from vaping. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4604.74s)]
*  You could use pharmacology, you could use alpha GPC, [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4606.82s)]
*  you could use herprosine in combination with exercise. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4609.38s)]
*  However, I strongly, strongly recommend [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4612.7s)]
*  that anyone who's interested in lifelong learning, [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4615.62s)]
*  think about organizing your bouts of learning, [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4618.46s)]
*  especially cognitive learning to come in the two [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4620.42s)]
*  to three hours, maybe even four hours, [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4623.42s)]
*  but certainly in the one to two hours [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4625.26s)]
*  after you do some sort of exercise [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4627.099999999999s)]
*  that doesn't leave you exhausted, [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4628.78s)]
*  but leaves you with elevated levels of energy in your body. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4630.62s)]
*  So you don't want to take this physical exercise [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4634.46s)]
*  that I'm talking about to exhaustion [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4636.86s)]
*  because that's going to leave you depleted. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4638.94s)]
*  That's going to cause a uptake in parasympathetic activity. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4640.46s)]
*  Any of you that have done a hard leg workout, [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4644.38s)]
*  and then two, three hours later, [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4646.78s)]
*  you're just like, it's very clear. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4648.14s)]
*  Brain oxygen levels are down, [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4649.78s)]
*  parasympathetic activity is up, [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4651.62s)]
*  you are tired because you exhausted [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4653.38s)]
*  all that energy and exercise. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4654.9800000000005s)]
*  But if you can use exercise as a trigger [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4656.5s)]
*  to release adrenaline and stimulate these pathways [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4659.18s)]
*  within the brain that arrive via the signaling [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4661.5s)]
*  from the vagus, you do indeed open up the opportunity [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4663.9800000000005s)]
*  for enhanced neuroplasticity at any age. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4667.22s)]
*  And that is a non-trivial thing. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4670.66s)]
*  In fact, it's downright exciting [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4672.9s)]
*  because the search for adult neuroplasticity tools [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4674.379999999999s)]
*  is one that's existed probably for thousands of years, [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4677.42s)]
*  and that has been documented for hundreds of years. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4679.86s)]
*  And the thing that makes the nervous system of humans [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4682.0199999999995s)]
*  so special is that it is capable of changing itself [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4684.42s)]
*  throughout the lifespan. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4687.98s)]
*  So now you know at least one method by which you can do that, [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4689.42s)]
*  and it of course involves the vagus. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4691.86s)]
*  Okay, so one of the most incredible things [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4694.62s)]
*  about the vagus nerve that I myself [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4696.9s)]
*  have really not ever heard talked about out there [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4699.0199999999995s)]
*  is the way it communicates and coordinates [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4701.58s)]
*  levels of serotonin in the gut [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4704.1s)]
*  with levels of serotonin in the brain. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4706.46s)]
*  Now, a discussion about serotonin that's complete [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4709.1s)]
*  would take many, many hours, [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4712.42s)]
*  but suffice to say that serotonin is a neuromodulator, [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4713.62s)]
*  much like dopamine or acetylcholine or norepinephrine, [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4717.18s)]
*  in that it modulates the activity of other circuits. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4719.7s)]
*  It's critically important for mood. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4722.66s)]
*  In the gut, it's critically important for gut motility, [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4724.94s)]
*  for ease of digestion, and for gut health. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4728.74s)]
*  In the brain, we say serotonin is important for mood. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4732.54s)]
*  I don't want to give the impression [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4734.66s)]
*  that high levels of serotonin, [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4736.06s)]
*  good low levels of serotonin, bad. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4737.42s)]
*  Serotonin needs to be at a particular level, [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4740.46s)]
*  so neither too high nor too low. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4742.86s)]
*  As many of you know, one of the major ways [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4744.9s)]
*  that depression has been treated over the last decades [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4746.54s)]
*  is through the administration of something called SSRI, [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4748.74s)]
*  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4751.82s)]
*  which have the net effect of increasing levels [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4754.18s)]
*  of serotonin at synapses. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4756.18s)]
*  SSRIs are somewhat controversial [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4758.14s)]
*  because in many people, [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4759.9s)]
*  they do alleviate certain symptoms of depression, [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4761.099999999999s)]
*  but they often carry side effects [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4763.66s)]
*  because serotonin is used in multiple circuits [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4765.42s)]
*  throughout the brain. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4768.0199999999995s)]
*  I don't want to give the impression [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4769.139999999999s)]
*  that SSRIs are always bad or always good. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4770.62s)]
*  It's highly dependent on the patient [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4773.379999999999s)]
*  and a bunch of other things that really, unfortunately, [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4775.42s)]
*  can only be explored through experimentation. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4777.98s)]
*  That's typically what psychiatrists will do. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4780.54s)]
*  They'll prescribe an SSRI at a given dose, [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4782.0199999999995s)]
*  see how a patient reacts. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4784.62s)]
*  Maybe they'll take them off an SSRI entirely, [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4785.74s)]
*  give them a different type of antidepressant [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4787.82s)]
*  that works on a different set of neuromodulators [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4789.74s)]
*  like dopamine and norepinephrine. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4791.54s)]
*  So well, buterin would be a non-SSRI antidepressant. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4793.179999999999s)]
*  And there are a whole set of issues around SSRIs. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4796.099999999999s)]
*  For instance, they can be very beneficial [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4798.179999999999s)]
*  for people with full clinical OCD, [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4800.78s)]
*  obsessive compulsive disorder. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4803.0599999999995s)]
*  And then again, other people suffer terrible side effects [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4804.54s)]
*  from SSRIs. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4807.94s)]
*  So I don't want to suggest that SSRIs are a solution. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4808.78s)]
*  I also don't want to suggest that serotonin [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4812.98s)]
*  is the only problem with depression [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4815.58s)]
*  or is always a problem in cases of depression. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4817.82s)]
*  That itself is heavily debated. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4820.299999999999s)]
*  What's emerging from the data [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4822.139999999999s)]
*  is that elevating levels of serotonin in the brain [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4823.299999999999s)]
*  can increase neuroplasticity, [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4826.82s)]
*  which can allow people who have major depression [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4828.58s)]
*  to learn new contingencies. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4831.139999999999s)]
*  These are people who at one point are thinking, [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4832.74s)]
*  why would I ever try and get a new relationship or job? [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4835.62s)]
*  Everything always turns out terribly. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4838.42s)]
*  These are hallmarks of depression, [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4839.799999999999s)]
*  lack of excitement about the future. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4842.299999999999s)]
*  Everything's a negative outcome in their mind. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4844.78s)]
*  Through neuroplasticity, [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4846.98s)]
*  it's clear that people can form new contingencies. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4848.54s)]
*  They can start to imagine life as more positive [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4850.799999999999s)]
*  and holding more possibility. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4853.379999999999s)]
*  And changing levels of serotonin is known to be, [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4855.339999999999s)]
*  much in the same way acetylcholine can increase plasticity, [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4857.74s)]
*  permissive for neuroplasticity. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4860.94s)]
*  So that might be one way by which SSRIs [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4862.879999999999s)]
*  actually can provide help for certain people for depression. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4865.5s)]
*  However, because of the side effects associated with SSRIs, [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4869.82s)]
*  many people are leaning away from them. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4872.299999999999s)]
*  And yet having adequate levels of serotonin [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4874.06s)]
*  is absolutely critical for people depressed, [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4876.9800000000005s)]
*  as well as people who are not depressed, [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4879.68s)]
*  to feel a sense of wellbeing, [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4881.38s)]
*  just overall sense of wellbeing, [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4882.9400000000005s)]
*  being okay with who they are and where life is at, [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4884.620000000001s)]
*  being able to lean into effort and all these things. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4888.06s)]
*  It's absolutely critical that we have [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4889.900000000001s)]
*  adequate levels of serotonin in the brain. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4891.54s)]
*  Now you may have heard, and it is absolutely true, [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4894.22s)]
*  that 90% of the serotonin manufactured in your body [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4896.860000000001s)]
*  is in the gut. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4900.6s)]
*  Now what you don't often hear [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4902.06s)]
*  is that serotonin stays in the gut, right? [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4904.02s)]
*  We hear these days, [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4907.120000000001s)]
*  oh, you know, most of your serotonin [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4907.96s)]
*  is manufactured in your gut, [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4909.9400000000005s)]
*  which has given millions of people the false impression [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4911.580000000001s)]
*  that if you get your gut serotonin right, [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4914.740000000001s)]
*  somehow it's traveling up to your brain [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4917.360000000001s)]
*  and performing all the important roles [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4920.1s)]
*  that serotonin plays in your brain. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4921.740000000001s)]
*  That's not how it works at all. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4923.38s)]
*  Fortunately, however, [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4925.620000000001s)]
*  there are ways that you can modify [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4926.860000000001s)]
*  the levels of serotonin in your gut. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4928.9400000000005s)]
*  And indeed, the levels of serotonin in your gut [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4931.0s)]
*  powerfully impact the levels of serotonin in your brain. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4933.96s)]
*  And this occurs, you guessed it, by way of the vagus. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4936.88s)]
*  It's a super cool mechanism, [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4940.28s)]
*  and it's one that you can exert some positive control over [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4941.76s)]
*  in order to, for instance, [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4944.98s)]
*  increase your baseline levels of mood, [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4946.74s)]
*  in order to increase levels of serotonin, [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4949.28s)]
*  if that's something that you seek. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4951.56s)]
*  Here's the pathway and the mechanism. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4953.26s)]
*  And I'm going to provide this in kind of top contour form. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4954.68s)]
*  In the future, I'll do an entire episode about serotonin, [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4957.76s)]
*  but here's the idea. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4960.54s)]
*  In your gut, you have cells, including neurons, [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4962.98s)]
*  but you also have a lot of other cells, [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4966.18s)]
*  mostly other cells, frankly. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4967.7s)]
*  And there's a particular category of cells [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4969.7s)]
*  called the enterochromophin cells. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4972.0199999999995s)]
*  You don't need to know that name, [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4974.38s)]
*  but if you want, they're the enterochromophin cells, [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4975.34s)]
*  and they manufacture serotonin. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4977.26s)]
*  They do that through a beautiful pathway [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4979.98s)]
*  involving an enzymatic reaction [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4981.94s)]
*  that converts tryptophan from the food you eat. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4983.86s)]
*  Tryptophan's an amino acid, [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4986.06s)]
*  gets converted eventually into serotonin. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4987.58s)]
*  There are a bunch of steps in there in the biochemistry. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4989.74s)]
*  Gets converted into serotonin. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4991.78s)]
*  That serotonin binds to the ends of neurons, [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4993.46s)]
*  the axons of neurons in the vagus nerve, [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4997.38s)]
*  that innervate your gut, not just your stomach, [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=4999.46s)]
*  but your large intestine and your small intestine. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5002.3s)]
*  Remember, those sensory afferents, [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5005.48s)]
*  those sensory axons that extend into the body [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5007.34s)]
*  have receptors on them, right? [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5011.26s)]
*  The serotonin in the gut, [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5014.0199999999995s)]
*  assuming you're getting enough tryptophan, [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5015.86s)]
*  and assuming the milieu of your gut is correct, [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5018.26s)]
*  we'll talk about what that means [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5020.38s)]
*  and how you can exert control over it, [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5021.26s)]
*  get the milieu right. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5022.66s)]
*  That serotonin binds to the ends of those axons in the gut [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5024.34s)]
*  and stimulates a particular category of them [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5028.46s)]
*  that then relays the signal up and through nodos ganglion, [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5032.38s)]
*  you now are familiar with these names, [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5036.54s)]
*  up into the brain to the nucleus tractus solitaris, [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5038.42s)]
*  okay, that NTS again, [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5043.14s)]
*  and then the nucleus tractus solitaris [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5045.46s)]
*  doesn't just communicate with locus serulius [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5048.0s)]
*  and with nucleus basalis, [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5049.88s)]
*  it also sends a powerful signal [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5050.88s)]
*  to what's called the dorsal raphe nucleus. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5053.0s)]
*  The dorsal raphe nucleus in your brain [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5055.16s)]
*  is responsible for the release of the majority [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5057.96s)]
*  of the serotonin in your brain. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5060.68s)]
*  So when you hear that most of the serotonin in your body [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5062.8s)]
*  is made in your gut, that's true, [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5065.6s)]
*  and it stays in your gut, [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5068.56s)]
*  but the levels of serotonin [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5070.08s)]
*  are communicated to the brain by the vagus [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5071.56s)]
*  and then stimulates the release of serotonin [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5075.48s)]
*  from the dorsal raphe nucleus. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5077.72s)]
*  So the question therefore becomes, [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5079.88s)]
*  if we want to increase levels of serotonin in the brain [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5082.280000000001s)]
*  or simply to maintain healthy levels of serotonin [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5085.42s)]
*  in the brain for somebody who's not depressed [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5088.04s)]
*  or maybe somebody who's having low mood, [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5089.7s)]
*  just to keep elevated levels of mood [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5091.280000000001s)]
*  and proper levels of serotonin overall [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5093.12s)]
*  because it's involved in lots of things, not just mood, [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5095.280000000001s)]
*  we need to make sure that we're getting adequate production [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5098.88s)]
*  of serotonin in the gut. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5101.3s)]
*  And again, adequate production of serotonin in the gut [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5103.16s)]
*  has a bunch of other positive effects [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5105.88s)]
*  on the immune system, on gut motility. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5107.400000000001s)]
*  In fact, having adequate levels of serotonin in the gut [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5109.32s)]
*  is powerfully associated with having a healthy gut [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5112.12s)]
*  and not having irritable gut. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5114.400000000001s)]
*  Irritable bowel syndrome is something [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5116.32s)]
*  that vexes many people. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5118.18s)]
*  You know, it might sound kind of funny [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5120.0s)]
*  to those of you that don't have, [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5121.22s)]
*  oh, you have an irritable bowel. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5122.06s)]
*  People with IBS, irritable bowel syndrome, [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5123.6s)]
*  oftentimes suffer tremendously. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5126.0s)]
*  They can't go out to dinner, [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5128.52s)]
*  they can't eat foods that other people offer them, [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5129.52s)]
*  they'll eat a bunch of foods for a while and feel fine, [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5132.1s)]
*  then they feel terrible. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5134.38s)]
*  It's not just about having diarrhea. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5135.66s)]
*  Often they have a bunch of other gut issues [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5137.38s)]
*  and it's correlated with a bunch of other major problems [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5139.24s)]
*  over time. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5142.38s)]
*  We're going to do an entire episode about gut health [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5143.9s)]
*  as it relates to IBS. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5145.78s)]
*  There are things that you can do to improve IBS. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5147.4s)]
*  One of them is to keep your, [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5149.34s)]
*  or get your gut levels of serotonin right. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5151.139999999999s)]
*  How do you do that? [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5154.78s)]
*  Well, one way to do that is to make sure [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5156.0199999999995s)]
*  that the microbiota of your gut are healthy [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5158.139999999999s)]
*  and that they are diverse. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5160.9s)]
*  The best way to do that, [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5162.36s)]
*  not using any kind of supplementation [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5164.18s)]
*  is to make sure that you're ingesting [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5166.320000000001s)]
*  one to four servings of low sugar fermented foods per day. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5168.06s)]
*  I've talked about this before on the podcast. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5171.1s)]
*  This is based on beautiful data [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5172.700000000001s)]
*  from my colleague, Justin Sonnenberg [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5174.26s)]
*  and Christopher Gardner at Stanford, [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5176.42s)]
*  showed that the ingestion of one to four servings [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5178.62s)]
*  of low sugar fermented foods per day. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5180.820000000001s)]
*  So these would be things like kimchi, sauerkraut, [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5182.900000000001s)]
*  again, low sugar, look at the labels. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5186.02s)]
*  This is the stuff that would need to be refrigerated. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5187.700000000001s)]
*  We're not talking about pickles [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5190.22s)]
*  kept on the non-refrigerated shelf [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5191.14s)]
*  or the non-refrigerated section of the grocery store, [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5193.3s)]
*  but rather the brine and the pickles [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5195.54s)]
*  that don't have a ton of sugar. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5197.58s)]
*  So the sour pickles that is, [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5199.42s)]
*  that are kept in the refrigerator, things like kimchi, [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5201.14s)]
*  things like kombucha, [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5204.06s)]
*  keep in mind some kombucha has alcohol. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5206.02s)]
*  So keep that in mind if you're giving this to kids [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5208.38s)]
*  who shouldn't be ingesting alcohol. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5210.68s)]
*  Any adults probably shouldn't be ingesting alcohol. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5212.5s)]
*  Kombucha has very little alcohol, [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5214.8s)]
*  but if you're an alcoholic [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5216.1s)]
*  and you're completely avoiding alcohol, [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5216.9800000000005s)]
*  you should know that. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5218.3s)]
*  Kombucha contains some alcohol. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5219.34s)]
*  Things like kefir, quality yogurts, low sugar yogurts. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5221.96s)]
*  You can look up online [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5226.36s)]
*  what are different low sugar fermented foods. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5227.5s)]
*  These things are going to improve the gut microbiota [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5229.24s)]
*  that in turn promote the production of serotonin, [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5232.1s)]
*  if and only if, this is important, [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5235.88s)]
*  if and only if there's also sufficient levels of tryptophan [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5238.06s)]
*  in your dietary intake. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5241.4s)]
*  So you're going to want to take a look at what you're eating [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5242.92s)]
*  and just through a simple online search, [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5244.78s)]
*  you can figure out whether or not you're getting [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5246.72s)]
*  sufficient levels of tryptophan. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5248.66s)]
*  Many people are familiar with the idea, [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5250.8s)]
*  because it's true, [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5252.76s)]
*  that turkey contains high levels of tryptophan. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5253.72s)]
*  This is thought to be responsible [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5256.24s)]
*  for the post Thanksgiving dinner effect, [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5258.24s)]
*  although that's probably due to just eating a lot of food. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5259.9800000000005s)]
*  And when the gut is distended, [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5262.84s)]
*  the distension of the gut is communicated [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5264.84s)]
*  by mechanosensors up the vagus nerve, sensory neurons, [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5266.64s)]
*  and set in motion the so-called rest and digest, [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5270.28s)]
*  or I guess it would be like collapse and pass out. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5273.84s)]
*  And in the case of Thanksgiving, collapse and pass out. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5277.12s)]
*  Effect of having a lot of food in your gut, [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5280.8s)]
*  doesn't matter what the food is, [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5282.88s)]
*  but you're going to want to make sure [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5283.92s)]
*  that you're ingesting foods [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5284.96s)]
*  with sufficient levels of tryptophan. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5286.0s)]
*  So dairy products will do that, [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5287.72s)]
*  white turkey meat will do that. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5289.76s)]
*  There are other foods that have tryptophan in them. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5291.04s)]
*  I'm not going to bother to list those off now. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5293.08s)]
*  You can simply look those up. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5294.56s)]
*  So make sure you're getting enough tryptophan in your diet. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5295.52s)]
*  Make sure that you're getting enough low sugar [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5297.84s)]
*  fermented foods, or if you're not doing that, [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5299.56s)]
*  and perhaps even if you are, [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5301.8s)]
*  you might think about supplementing your diet [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5303.04s)]
*  with probiotic on occasion, right? [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5305.12s)]
*  I'm not talking about constantly taking [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5307.360000000001s)]
*  high doses of probiotics. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5308.88s)]
*  I actually don't recommend that. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5310.52s)]
*  But for many people who are suffering low mood, [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5312.240000000001s)]
*  supplementing with a quality probiotic [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5314.76s)]
*  can actually improve mood. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5316.6s)]
*  And the purported mechanism by which that happens [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5318.120000000001s)]
*  is the increase in serotonin that is allowed [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5320.6s)]
*  by improving the gut microbiota [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5323.360000000001s)]
*  and including foods with enough tryptophan, [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5325.400000000001s)]
*  which is the precursor to serotonin. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5327.160000000001s)]
*  So what I've done here is I've created [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5329.200000000001s)]
*  the real conceptual link, the anatomical link, [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5330.96s)]
*  and the chemical link between the production [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5334.84s)]
*  of serotonin in the gut and serotonin in the brain. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5336.56s)]
*  And I wouldn't be talking about this [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5339.4s)]
*  if there wasn't actually data on this. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5340.719999999999s)]
*  I'll include links to a few papers about the, [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5342.92s)]
*  and here I'm quoting the title of a great paper, [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5345.639999999999s)]
*  the interaction of the vagus nerve and serotonin [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5347.32s)]
*  in the gut-brain axis. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5349.44s)]
*  There's also been at least one clinical trial study [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5351.32s)]
*  exploring how taking probiotics, [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5354.639999999999s)]
*  and in this case it was actually probiotics plus magnesium. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5356.639999999999s)]
*  It was magnesium orotate, [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5360.4s)]
*  which is just one form of magnesium, [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5362.36s)]
*  as well as I would say a low-ish dose of coenum Q10, [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5364.2s)]
*  combining those three things in this paper [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5369.32s)]
*  entitled Probiotics and Magnesium Orotate. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5371.76s)]
*  It should have said probiotics and magnesium orotate [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5374.639999999999s)]
*  and coenzyme Q10, but the title is [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5377.36s)]
*  Probiotics and Magnesium Orotate [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5379.32s)]
*  for the Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder, [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5381.2s)]
*  a Randomized Double-Blind Control Trial. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5383.48s)]
*  I want to emphasize that the results of this paper show [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5385.679999999999s)]
*  that in the short term, [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5389.92s)]
*  there's an improvement in symptoms of major depression. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5391.88s)]
*  That is, symptoms of major depression were reduced [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5395.8s)]
*  through the administration of this combination [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5398.72s)]
*  of probiotics, magnesium orotate, and coenzyme Q10. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5401.8s)]
*  However, it was a short-lived effect. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5407.76s)]
*  Now, it was also a short-lived treatment, [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5409.92s)]
*  but it was a short-lived effect that showed up [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5412.280000000001s)]
*  in the essentially starting about the four-week mark [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5415.320000000001s)]
*  and then carried out to 10 and 15 weeks, [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5419.4400000000005s)]
*  the effect disappeared. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5422.08s)]
*  Now, this is important because what it suggests [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5423.56s)]
*  is that in the short term, [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5425.8s)]
*  if you're seeking to improve your mood [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5427.4s)]
*  or if you're suffering from major depression, [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5429.5199999999995s)]
*  please seek help for major depression. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5431.5599999999995s)]
*  This, of course, wouldn't be the only approach. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5433.04s)]
*  You don't want to start being your own psychiatrist. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5434.799999999999s)]
*  This treatment very well could be combined with things [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5438.5199999999995s)]
*  and should be combined probably with things like exercise, [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5440.879999999999s)]
*  maybe with pharmacologic treatment, [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5443.16s)]
*  with antidepressant drugs. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5444.639999999999s)]
*  It really depends on the situation. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5445.879999999999s)]
*  But if you're somebody who's suffering [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5447.679999999999s)]
*  from major depression or just mild depression, [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5449.28s)]
*  or if you're just seeking to maintain [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5451.24s)]
*  healthy serotonin levels or improve your mood slightly, [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5453.04s)]
*  the consumption of things [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5456.68s)]
*  that are going to improve your gut microbiome [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5458.56s)]
*  absolutely is going to support that process. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5461.52s)]
*  This has been shown over and over again [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5463.72s)]
*  because the gut microbiota create [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5465.280000000001s)]
*  these short-chain fatty acids [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5467.4400000000005s)]
*  that are critically involved in this biochemical pathway [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5469.240000000001s)]
*  that converts tryptophan into serotonin. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5472.16s)]
*  I'm going to repeat that because it's very important. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5474.96s)]
*  The microbiota of the gut, [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5477.12s)]
*  if they're diverse and you have enough of them, [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5478.400000000001s)]
*  are going to produce the short-chain fatty acids [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5480.4400000000005s)]
*  that are critically required for the conversion of tryptophan, [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5482.96s)]
*  which again is going to come from your diet, [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5486.0s)]
*  into the serotonin of your gut, [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5488.08s)]
*  which in turn is going to be relayed. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5489.68s)]
*  And it's not the actual serotonin that's relayed, [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5492.36s)]
*  but the presence of serotonin at sufficient levels [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5494.44s)]
*  in the gut is communicated by the vagus nerve [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5497.68s)]
*  up to the dorsal raffae nucleus. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5500.68s)]
*  Remember, there's some stations in between, [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5502.24s)]
*  but it's communicated up to the dorsal raffae [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5503.6s)]
*  and your dorsal raffae then releases serotonin in the brain. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5505.92s)]
*  Again, a beautiful coordination of the body and the brain, [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5509.08s)]
*  just as activity levels in the body and the brain [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5513.56s)]
*  are matched through the vagus, [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5516.04s)]
*  or from the brain to the body, [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5517.320000000001s)]
*  depending on the direction of flow, right? [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5518.6s)]
*  Alertness in the brain, body becomes alert. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5520.120000000001s)]
*  Alertness in the body, brain becomes alert. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5521.88s)]
*  Serotonin elevated in the gut, [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5524.280000000001s)]
*  serotonin elevated in the brain. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5526.56s)]
*  All of that happens by way of vagal signaling. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5529.240000000001s)]
*  Okay, so the vagus is involved in lots and lots of things. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5532.56s)]
*  It's not just for calming down, [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5536.160000000001s)]
*  it's also for slowing the heart rate, [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5537.88s)]
*  which is related to calming down, [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5540.72s)]
*  but it's critically required for this thing [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5542.4s)]
*  that we're calling auto-regulation for increasing HRV. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5544.0s)]
*  It's also involved in increasing levels of alertness, [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5547.44s)]
*  and you can do that through exercise. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5550.48s)]
*  It's also involved in increasing levels of serotonin [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5552.04s)]
*  in the brain, you just learned about that. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5554.639999999999s)]
*  But there is, as you've probably heard before, [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5556.799999999999s)]
*  also a role for the vagus nerve in calming down. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5558.92s)]
*  Now, the reason I saved this portion for last [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5563.28s)]
*  is because there's just so much information out there [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5565.12s)]
*  about how vagal activation calms us down. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5567.799999999999s)]
*  And I felt it was important that I also focus [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5571.08s)]
*  on some of the ways that vagus does other things [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5573.72s)]
*  quite robustly, including also enhancing learning [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5575.84s)]
*  and plasticity. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5579.62s)]
*  But I would be remiss if I didn't offer [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5581.44s)]
*  some of the science-backed tools [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5583.68s)]
*  for calming yourself down by engaging the vagus. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5585.6s)]
*  And when I say engaging the vagus, [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5589.32s)]
*  I mean engaging very specific pathways [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5590.96s)]
*  within the vagus circuitry. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5593.62s)]
*  You now, of course, can appreciate [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5595.28s)]
*  that the vagus nerve is a superhighway, [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5597.36s)]
*  bidirectional superhighway of sensory [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5600.0s)]
*  and motor connections. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5602.4s)]
*  Has a ton of specificity, [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5604.0s)]
*  it's signaling mechanical and chemical information, [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5605.72s)]
*  it's controlling the body. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5607.88s)]
*  And yet there are specific pathways [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5609.24s)]
*  that will indeed calm you down if you activate them. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5611.64s)]
*  These are the ones that you typically hear about [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5616.68s)]
*  at the end of yoga classes, [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5618.32s)]
*  that you hear about often online. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5619.96s)]
*  And I don't want to be disparaging of any of that. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5621.84s)]
*  In fact, I love, love, love the book [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5624.04s)]
* , Polyvagal Theory by Stephen Porges. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5626.52s)]
*  I think it's a beautiful description [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5628.88s)]
*  of our understanding about the vagus nerve, [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5631.1s)]
*  circa, I don't know, maybe 10, 15 years ago, [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5633.34s)]
*  which is not disparaging at all. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5637.1s)]
*  I think he did an incredible job [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5639.08s)]
*  of talking about the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5641.26s)]
*  which I'll talk about in a few moments, [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5644.400000000001s)]
*  as a pathway for regulation of bodily state, [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5646.3s)]
*  for calming down about the role [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5649.56s)]
*  of parent-child relationships in infancy [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5651.92s)]
*  and how the vagus nerve pathways are present [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5654.64s)]
*  and can be activated early in life [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5656.8s)]
*  without any learning or plasticity [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5658.92s)]
*  and how that's so critically important [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5660.56s)]
*  to the bond that's formed between caretaker and infant. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5662.52s)]
*  And there's just a beautiful set of studies [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5665.96s)]
*  and a beautiful set of clinical data [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5668.360000000001s)]
*  that he describes in that book, Polyvagal Theory, [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5670.08s)]
*  as it relates to things like PTSD, et cetera. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5672.6s)]
*  So hats off, kudos, and much respect and gratitude [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5675.28s)]
*  to Stephen Porges for writing Polyvagal Theory. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5679.4800000000005s)]
*  Most of what I've talked about up until now [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5682.360000000001s)]
*  are things that are either touched on just briefly [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5684.84s)]
*  or that are not included in his book on Polyvagal Theory, [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5687.64s)]
*  mostly because they relate to data [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5690.32s)]
*  that had been accumulated in the last 10 or 15 years. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5691.88s)]
*  And so there was no way it could be in that book. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5695.28s)]
*  The ways to calm down using activation [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5697.68s)]
*  of specific vagal pathways do indeed start [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5700.6s)]
*  to mimic some of the things that we hear about [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5704.4800000000005s)]
*  or at the end of yoga classes, [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5707.16s)]
*  or that we think of in terms of kind of new agey [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5708.96s)]
*  types of things. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5713.24s)]
*  Now, this is coming from somebody who earlier [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5714.08s)]
*  was talking about breathwork, right? [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5716.8s)]
*  I was talking about cyclic sighing [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5718.6s)]
*  or cyclic physiological sighing. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5720.44s)]
*  In science, we tend to call it respiration physiology. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5722.64s)]
*  We call it cyclic sighing. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5725.84s)]
*  In yogic traditions or in breathwork classes, [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5727.08s)]
*  they might call it something else. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5730.38s)]
*  For those of you that are familiar with me, [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5732.12s)]
*  you know that I appreciate all the lenses [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5733.44s)]
*  into ways to be healthier mentally, physically, [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5736.08s)]
*  and in two ways to improve our performance. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5738.88s)]
*  I just happened to take the biological, [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5741.64s)]
*  typically the neurobiological and physiological perspective [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5744.240000000001s)]
*  on these things, because I like to think, [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5747.860000000001s)]
*  in fact, I know that understanding mechanism [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5749.84s)]
*  gives us more agency over these protocols and practices. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5752.76s)]
*  So what I'm going to describe next is my view [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5757.02s)]
*  of the specific practices that yes, absolutely exist [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5759.64s)]
*  in other territories related to yogic practices, et cetera, [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5763.92s)]
*  that have been purported to increase levels [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5767.6s)]
*  of parasympathetic activation by engaging the vagus. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5770.74s)]
*  The reason I selected the things I'm about to tell you [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5773.94s)]
*  is because I ran them by two colleagues, [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5776.179999999999s)]
*  one who is a neurologist and psychiatrist, practicing, [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5778.98s)]
*  the other who is a neurosurgeon [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5783.36s)]
*  and is very familiar with the vagus. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5786.9s)]
*  And what I did is I said, [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5789.54s)]
*  listen, there's all this stuff out there. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5790.86s)]
*  You can hear all sorts of interesting things on YouTube [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5793.0199999999995s)]
*  and elsewhere about ways to calm down [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5795.66s)]
*  by engaging the vagus. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5797.0599999999995s)]
*  Which of these, and I basically described five, [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5798.54s)]
*  which of these typical five practices [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5802.34s)]
*  do you think actually triggers activation [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5804.98s)]
*  of the specific nerve fibers [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5808.64s)]
*  that would trigger a parasympathetic response? [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5810.5s)]
*  And what was interesting is that both of them said, [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5813.18s)]
*  actually there are three of them [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5816.26s)]
*  that absolutely trigger activation [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5818.1s)]
*  of the parasympathetic response. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5820.28s)]
*  And we know because we've recorded [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5822.18s)]
*  from those neural pathways. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5823.74s)]
*  And so it's obvious that they work. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5825.38s)]
*  So those are the three that I'm going to describe. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5828.14s)]
*  I want to remind you that if you want to calm down fast, [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5830.9400000000005s)]
*  the physiological sigh is still going to be your best tool. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5833.740000000001s)]
*  If you want to improve HRV, [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5836.96s)]
*  you want to get better at auto-regulation [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5839.1s)]
*  and you want your HRV to improve in sleep as well. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5840.62s)]
*  The deliberate exhales from time to time [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5843.34s)]
*  spread throughout the day, still going to be great. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5845.54s)]
*  Still do your high-intensity interval training [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5847.4800000000005s)]
*  and other ways to increase HRV. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5849.06s)]
*  But if you want to use the vagal pathways to calm down, [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5850.9400000000005s)]
*  here are the three best ways [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5854.58s)]
*  that are supported by the neurophysiology in humans [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5856.38s)]
*  that I'm going to tell you about. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5859.9400000000005s)]
*  The first capitalizes on the fact [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5861.02s)]
*  that a major branch of the vagus [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5862.86s)]
*  that extends out of the brainstem [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5866.14s)]
*  and that includes a lot of those sensory afferents, [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5868.06s)]
*  those axons coursing up from the body to the brainstem [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5870.86s)]
*  runs along a portion of the neck that's deep to the muscle [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5875.86s)]
*  that's going to stick out [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5879.74s)]
*  if you turn your head to one side. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5880.58s)]
*  Now I'm specifically avoiding the muscle [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5882.58s)]
*  and vasculature nomenclature right now [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5885.06s)]
*  because we've already had so many terms this episode [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5886.88s)]
*  and it's really not necessary [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5889.5s)]
*  to understand how to use these practices. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5890.740000000001s)]
*  But were you to say, lie down [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5892.5s)]
*  or even just sit at a table surface like I am now, [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5895.26s)]
*  for those of you that are listening, [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5898.780000000001s)]
*  I'm just seated in front of my desk, [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5899.660000000001s)]
*  I'm putting my hands, palms down, [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5901.5s)]
*  my elbows at the edge of the table. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5904.42s)]
*  And what I'm going to do next [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5906.5s)]
*  is I'm going to push my elbows down and away from my ears. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5908.02s)]
*  Then I'm going to turn my head up into the right [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5913.42s)]
*  and I'm going to talk while I'm doing it, [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5918.02s)]
*  but you wouldn't want to. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5919.820000000001s)]
*  And when one does that, you feel a kind of stretch [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5921.46s)]
*  both on the outside of the neck, [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5925.900000000001s)]
*  so that's on the left-hand side, [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5928.1s)]
*  as well as in particular on the right-hand side. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5929.56s)]
*  Okay. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5933.18s)]
*  And it's important to keep your elbows pushing down [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5934.42s)]
*  and you're looking up into the right. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5936.64s)]
*  And then you do it to the other side, [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5937.780000000001s)]
*  you go up into the left. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5938.820000000001s)]
*  Yes, this is looking a lot like yoga, [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5940.14s)]
*  but this is not yoga. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5944.1s)]
*  This is a way of mechanically activating [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5946.52s)]
*  some of the fibers that course along the vasculature [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5952.46s)]
*  and the musculature at the side of the neck. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5956.38s)]
*  That is a major pathway of the vagus. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5959.02s)]
*  Now I had to ask my neurosurgeon [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5961.660000000001s)]
*  and neurophysiology friends, [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5964.4400000000005s)]
*  does this actually activate the vagus nerve? [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5967.26s)]
*  And they said, yes, to some degree, [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5970.1s)]
*  it's mechanically going to activate some of those fibers, [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5972.42s)]
*  some of those axons. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5976.46s)]
*  Is it going to activate the calming pathways [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5977.9800000000005s)]
*  of your vagus nerve as much as say, [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5979.820000000001s)]
*  electrical stimulation of your vagus nerve? [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5981.9400000000005s)]
*  No, it's not. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5983.9400000000005s)]
*  Electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5985.66s)]
*  is used for major depression. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5987.26s)]
*  It's also used using different patterns [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5989.320000000001s)]
*  of stimulation frequency to calm people down. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5991.72s)]
*  It can be used for a number of different things, [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5993.820000000001s)]
*  depending on the way this stimulation is done [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5995.52s)]
*  and where it's done along the vagus nerve pathways. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=5998.080000000001s)]
*  However, this basically mechanical activation [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6000.88s)]
*  of this vagus nerve pathway, [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6005.120000000001s)]
*  it doesn't just feel good [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6007.34s)]
*  because you're stretching your neck out. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6008.240000000001s)]
*  It does indeed activate some of the sensory [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6010.280000000001s)]
*  and probably some of the motor fibers as well [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6013.700000000001s)]
*  that course through the vagus nerve. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6015.72s)]
*  And keep in mind, this is interesting, [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6017.56s)]
*  that the majority of the parasympathetic effect [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6018.92s)]
*  of mechanically activating those vagal nerve fibers [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6021.56s)]
*  is going to be on the right-hand side. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6024.56s)]
*  I know this is starting to sound a little bit [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6026.64s)]
*  like yoga classes where they say, [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6027.96s)]
*  hey, breathing through your left nostril, [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6029.8s)]
*  your right nostril is going to reflect sympathetic [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6031.72s)]
*  or parasympathetic activation. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6035.160000000001s)]
*  Guess what? [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6037.4800000000005s)]
*  When we had Nome Sobel, [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6038.3s)]
*  one of the world's foremost experts on olfaction [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6039.52s)]
*  and basically sniffing and breathing [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6042.0s)]
*  and its effects on the brain on the podcast, [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6044.68s)]
*  he indeed told us that the switching back and forth [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6046.92s)]
*  between right and left nostril dominance [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6049.320000000001s)]
*  is indeed governed by changes [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6051.52s)]
*  in that seesaw of the autonomic nervous system. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6053.76s)]
*  It switches over, I believe, once about every 90 minutes. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6055.9800000000005s)]
*  Incredible, right? [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6058.92s)]
*  Obviously impacted if you have a deviated septum, et cetera. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6059.76s)]
*  So the stuff that comes from yogic tradition, [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6062.42s)]
*  while it might not be mechanistically accurate [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6064.200000000001s)]
*  and it sometimes includes other things [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6066.8s)]
*  that are unrelated to the mechanism, [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6068.64s)]
*  oftentimes it's pretty spot on. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6070.56s)]
*  So if you want to calm down [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6073.200000000001s)]
*  and you want to do that by activating your vagus, [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6075.120000000001s)]
*  you already know a bunch of ways that you can do that. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6076.820000000001s)]
*  We talked about it. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6078.4800000000005s)]
*  The ear thing, the exhale thing, et cetera, [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6080.0s)]
*  physiological size, [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6082.18s)]
*  but this simple process of looking up into the right [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6084.04s)]
*  and then up into the left. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6090.4s)]
*  And the reason for doing it both sides [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6091.56s)]
*  is you'll feel a stretch on one side [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6092.7s)]
*  then a contraction on the other. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6094.16s)]
*  Doing that a few times back and forth indeed [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6095.96s)]
*  can lead to a calmer state following. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6098.24s)]
*  How robust that is, [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6100.62s)]
*  it's going to depend on a lot of factors. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6102.6s)]
*  Frankly, I don't think it's as robust [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6104.8s)]
*  as the physiological sigh or exhale emphasized breathing. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6107.16s)]
*  I don't think it's as fast, [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6110.32s)]
*  but nonetheless it is supported by the anatomy. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6111.44s)]
*  It's supported by the function. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6113.5599999999995s)]
*  And a lot of people simply like to stretch. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6115.0s)]
*  So I'd be remiss if I didn't include that. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6116.86s)]
*  The other way that you can calm down [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6119.82s)]
*  by way of incorporating vagus nerve activation, [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6121.84s)]
*  and you can do that non-invasively, is the following. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6124.5s)]
*  All right, this one again, [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6127.36s)]
*  verified with people who are expert [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6129.36s)]
*  in these specific pathways in humans. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6132.32s)]
*  And I know it might not sound neuroscientific, [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6135.26s)]
*  but believe it or not, [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6138.68s)]
*  the stuff that you hear, no pun intended, [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6139.88s)]
*  about humming and activation of the vagus nerve [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6142.34s)]
*  and calming down by way of humming [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6146.02s)]
*  because of the way it impacts the vagus nerve [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6147.84s)]
*  turns out to be true. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6150.02s)]
*  However, and get this, you actually have to hum correctly. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6151.92s)]
*  Now, you might think humming is just, [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6156.1s)]
*  that's not what we're talking about here. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6160.02s)]
*  What we're talking about here is, [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6162.42s)]
*  again, mechanically through vibration, [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6164.78s)]
*  activating the branches of the vagus [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6166.96s)]
*  that innervate the larynx. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6168.66s)]
*  And now keep in mind, [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6170.58s)]
*  some of the neurons in nucleus ambiguous [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6171.78s)]
*  that carry neurons that are officially [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6173.7s)]
*  members of the vagus nerve, [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6176.139999999999s)]
*  they travel with neurons [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6177.98s)]
*  that are not officially members of the vagus, [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6179.46s)]
*  but they travel together from nucleus ambiguous [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6181.5599999999995s)]
*  to a lot of the speech machinery in your throat [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6184.179999999999s)]
*  and in your mouth and with your tongue and your lips. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6187.5s)]
*  That's a discussion for an entirely different podcast. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6190.58s)]
*  But it turns out if you view the hum [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6193.06s)]
*  through the perspective of that it's an H and an M, right? [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6195.02s)]
*  Hmm, right? [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6199.4800000000005s)]
*  That if you want to activate this vagal pathway [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6202.04s)]
*  to calm down, the way to hum correctly, [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6204.780000000001s)]
*  I know this sounds wild, [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6207.900000000001s)]
*  but the way to hum correctly [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6208.780000000001s)]
*  is actually to extend the H part, not the M. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6210.14s)]
*  I talked to somebody who's expert in speech neurophysiology [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6213.9800000000005s)]
*  and it's because the H part, the, [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6217.26s)]
*  hmm, is different than the, hmm, part. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6219.42s)]
*  The hmm is slightly higher frequency. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6223.259999999999s)]
*  And actually, if you notice, [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6225.5s)]
*  if you do an extended H hum and then an M hum after, [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6226.82s)]
*  you'll notice that it shifts from the back [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6230.62s)]
*  and deeper parts of your throat, [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6232.98s)]
*  which is where the vagal activation comes from, [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6234.839999999999s)]
*  to sort of further up along your speech pathway [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6237.32s)]
*  toward your mouth and your lips. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6240.2s)]
*  So just give that a try for a second. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6242.74s)]
*  Maybe you have to do this in private [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6244.5599999999995s)]
*  because otherwise it'd be too embarrassing. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6245.7s)]
*  But you, it's incredibly calming. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6247.08s)]
*  I did this earlier and I was really positively surprised [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6249.32s)]
*  how well it worked. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6252.48s)]
*  It's basically this. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6253.64s)]
*  You're trying to get the vibration to move [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6255.28s)]
*  from the back of your throat, down your neck, [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6257.5599999999995s)]
*  into your chest and even into your belly and diaphragm. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6260.48s)]
*  So it goes like this. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6263.2s)]
*  If you want to know what it's like [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6271.16s)]
*  from a sensation perspective, think about gargling. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6272.68s)]
*  This is getting crazier and crazier [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6276.4s)]
*  toward the end of this podcast. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6277.719999999999s)]
*  But indeed, if you look online, [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6278.839999999999s)]
*  gargling has been proposed as a way to activate [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6281.0s)]
*  the calming aspects, so-called parasympathetic aspects [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6283.66s)]
*  of the vagus nerve. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6286.679999999999s)]
*  And indeed, when you gargle, [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6287.5199999999995s)]
*  you're using the back of your throat. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6289.4s)]
*  That's the sensation. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6291.219999999999s)]
*  It's this vibration at the back of your throat. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6292.4s)]
*  So when you hum, emphasizing the H part of the hmm [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6294.24s)]
*  and leaving off the M part, it's [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6298.0s)]
*  like this. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6300.12s)]
*  And you can actually move the vibration down into your chest. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6304.44s)]
*  I find it's easier if I'm lying down. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6307.76s)]
*  And when you do that, it's quite remarkable [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6309.88s)]
*  how fast you calm down. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6313.8s)]
*  But give this a try. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6315.599999999999s)]
*  I know it might seem a little silly, [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6316.84s)]
*  but if you want to try and really deeply relax, [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6318.4s)]
*  this extended humming that you're trying to move down [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6322.16s)]
*  further and further from say your lips [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6324.88s)]
*  to the back of your throat, [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6328.46s)]
*  to deeper in your throat near your Adam's apple, [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6329.94s)]
*  to your chest region, even into your abdomen [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6332.14s)]
*  in your diaphragm, you'll notice that it really, [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6334.9800000000005s)]
*  really calms you down. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6337.7s)]
*  This is also, it turns out, [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6338.54s)]
*  because I talked to somebody who is a singer, [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6340.26s)]
*  this is the way that singers often will start to relax [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6342.34s)]
*  in order to get into some of the deeper frequency notes [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6346.86s)]
*  that they need to hit with their voice. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6349.18s)]
*  As you've probably observed, high notes sort of bring people [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6350.9s)]
*  up into their head and up, even if they're using [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6353.5s)]
*  their diaphragm, higher and higher and higher. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6356.1s)]
*  Whereas lower frequency sounds deeper and deeper, [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6358.14s)]
*  and it's just mechanical activation [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6361.26s)]
*  of the particular branches of the vagus [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6363.3s)]
*  that are able to drive this parasympathetic response. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6365.4400000000005s)]
*  And if you notice, the hum is like all speech and exhale. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6369.22s)]
*  It's a long, slow exhale. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6375.34s)]
*  So this is the third part. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6377.14s)]
*  There's also a collateral activation, [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6378.42s)]
*  which is just neuroscience speak for activation [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6380.6s)]
*  of that deceleration pathway. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6383.88s)]
*  When you do this humming at the back of your throat [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6386.12s)]
*  and down into your chest and into your belly, [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6388.64s)]
*  you're also getting the same effect that you get [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6390.78s)]
*  with an exhale, which is to slow the heart rate way, way down. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6392.72s)]
*  So it turns out the stuff they say it retreats [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6398.28s)]
*  in yoga classes is mechanistically supported. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6400.08s)]
*  At least some of it is, and some of it perhaps isn't. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6404.0199999999995s)]
*  And that doesn't really matter right now. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6407.4s)]
*  What we're talking about is the incredible pathway, [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6408.76s)]
*  the incredible neural circuit that is the vagus nerve. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6412.4s)]
*  In fact, calling it the vagus nerve, you now realize, [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6415.78s)]
*  as I talked about at the beginning of the episode, [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6418.66s)]
*  is really not sufficient to encapsulate [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6420.32s)]
*  the incredible variety of different pathways, [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6423.0199999999995s)]
*  the sensory stuff up from the body, [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6426.78s)]
*  the motor stuff down from the brain, [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6428.8s)]
*  the way you can calm down, the way you can alert yourself, [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6430.639999999999s)]
*  the relationship and pairing of serotonin levels [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6433.8s)]
*  in the gut through the microbiome and what you eat [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6436.58s)]
*  and the tryptophan with serotonin levels in the brain [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6439.139999999999s)]
*  and mood and neuroplasticity and learning. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6441.38s)]
*  And to be fair, we didn't even cover everything [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6444.34s)]
*  that the vagus nerve does. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6448.06s)]
*  There's this whole landscape of electrical stimulation [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6449.22s)]
*  of the vagus nerve, transcranial magnetic stimulation [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6452.06s)]
*  of the parts of the brain, [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6454.5s)]
*  like the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6455.400000000001s)]
*  that allow you to engage more plasticity [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6458.12s)]
*  and control over auto-regulation. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6460.62s)]
*  That stuff all requires devices and a physician [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6462.9400000000005s)]
*  or a laboratory to deliver. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6465.82s)]
*  So I focused on the things that you can do [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6467.58s)]
*  to activate your vagus and the various ways [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6470.22s)]
*  that's going to serve you best in terms of mental health, [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6472.3s)]
*  physical health and performance. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6474.42s)]
*  And I like to think that you also learned a lot [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6476.14s)]
*  about the vagus nerve biology, [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6478.68s)]
*  both structurally and functionally. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6480.62s)]
*  I personally find it to be one of the most incredible aspects [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6482.58s)]
*  of the nervous system. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6485.52s)]
*  It exists in all mammals. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6486.66s)]
*  It's also in non-malian vertebrates, [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6488.38s)]
*  but it's definitely in us humans [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6491.4400000000005s)]
*  and it's absolutely active from the time we're born [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6494.46s)]
*  until the very last breath we take [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6497.1s)]
*  in hopefully late, late age. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6499.86s)]
*  And it's just a miraculous pathway. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6502.38s)]
*  Nature created this vagus nerve thing [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6504.54s)]
*  and you can control it and understanding the mechanisms [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6508.299999999999s)]
*  by which you can control it, [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6512.0199999999995s)]
*  I do believe is the best way to go about it. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6513.299999999999s)]
*  So thank you for joining me [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6516.54s)]

*  I'm enchanted by the vagus nerve [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6521.98s)]

*  It's entitled, [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLbVW3Pj46A&t=6565.6s)]
