# Dr. Oded Rechavi: Genes & the Inheritance of Memories Across Generations | Huberman Lab Podcast
**Andrew Huberman:** [February 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDUetQMKM6g)
*  Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
*  where we discuss science
*  and science-based tools for everyday life.
*  I'm Andrew Huberman,
*  and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
*  at Stanford School of Medicine.
*  Today, my guest is Dr. Oded Rehavi.
*  Dr. Oded Rehavi is a professor of neurobiology
*  at Tel Aviv University in Israel.
*  His laboratory studies genetic inheritance.
*  Now, everybody is familiar with genetic inheritance
*  as the idea that we inherit genes from our parents,
*  and indeed, that is true.
*  Many people are also probably now aware
*  of the so-called epigenome,
*  that is, ways in which our environment and experiences
*  can change our genome and therefore,
*  the genes that we inherit or pass on to our children.
*  What is less known, however, and what is discussed today,
*  is the evidence that we can actually pass on traits
*  that relate to our experiences.
*  That's right.
*  There is evidence in worms, in flies, in mice,
*  and indeed, in human beings,
*  that memories can indeed be passed
*  from one generation to the next.
*  And that turns out to be just the tip of the iceberg
*  in terms of how our parents' experiences
*  and our experiences can be passed on
*  from one generation to the next,
*  both in terms of modifying the biological circuits
*  of the brain and body
*  and the psychological consequences
*  of those biological changes.
*  During today's episode,
*  Dr. Rehavi gives us a beautiful description
*  of how genetics work.
*  So even if you don't have a background in biology or science,
*  by the end of today's episode,
*  you will understand the core elements of genetics
*  and the genetic passage of traits
*  from one generation to the next.
*  In addition, he makes it clear
*  how certain experiences can indeed modify our genes
*  such that they are passed from our parents to us,
*  and even transgenerationally across multi-generations.
*  That is, one generation could experience something
*  and their grandchildren would still have
*  genetic modifications that reflect
*  those prior experiences of their grandparents.
*  Dr. Rehavi takes us on an incredible journey
*  explaining how our genes and different patterns
*  of inheritance shape our experience of life and who we are.
*  Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize
*  that this podcast is separate from my teaching
*  and research roles at Stanford.
*  It is, however, part of my desire and effort
*  to bring zero cost to consumer information
*  about science and science-related tools
*  to the general public.
*  In keeping with that theme,
*  I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
*  Our first sponsor is Roca.
*  Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
*  that are of the absolute highest quality.
*  The company was founded by two all-American swimmers
*  from Stanford, and everything about Roca eyeglasses
*  and sunglasses were designed with performance in mind.
*  I've spent a lifetime working on the biology,
*  the visual system, and I can tell you
*  that your visual system has to contend
*  with an enormous number of challenges
*  in order for you to be able to see clearly
*  under any conditions.
*  Roca understands this and has designed their eyeglasses
*  and sunglasses accordingly.
*  Originally, Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses
*  were designed for sport,
*  that is for things like running and cycling,
*  and many of the features they have reflect that.
*  So for instance, they are extremely lightweight,
*  they won't slip off your face if you get sweaty,
*  and they can indeed be worn for running and cycling
*  and things of that sort.
*  However, they also come in a number
*  of different aesthetics and styles
*  that make them perfectly suited, not just for sport,
*  but also for wearing to the office to work.
*  If you'd like to try Roca eyeglasses or sunglasses,
*  go to roca, that's R-O-K-A.com,
*  and enter the code Huberman to save 20% off your first order.
*  Again, that's roca, R-O-K-A.com,
*  and enter the code Huberman at checkout.
*  Today's episode is also brought to us by HVMN Ketone IQ.
*  Ketone IQ is a ketone supplement
*  that increases blood ketones.
*  Most everybody has heard of the so-called ketogenic diet.
*  Most people, including myself,
*  do not follow a ketogenic diet.
*  That does not, however, mean that ketones
*  cannot be valuable because ketones are one
*  of the primary sources of brain fuel and body fuel
*  that allows us to think clearly for long durations of time
*  and to perform well physically.
*  Which is all to say that even if you're somebody
*  who's not on a ketogenic diet, such as myself,
*  increasing your blood ketones can be immensely beneficial
*  for cognitive and physical performance.
*  Indeed, that's how I use ketone IQ.
*  I'll take one or two servings per day typically,
*  sometimes before a workout,
*  but most typically before doing a bout of cognitive work.
*  So I'm going to sit down and prepare a podcast
*  or focus on research for my lab or a writing project
*  or anything that requires a high degree of concentration
*  for a prolonged period of time.
*  Ingesting ketone IQ prior to that,
*  I've noticed greatly increases my level of concentration
*  and I can sustain that concentration
*  for much longer periods of time
*  than if I don't take ketone IQ.
*  If you'd like to try ketone IQ,
*  you can go to hvmn.com slash Huberman to save 20% off.
*  Again, that's hvmn.com slash Huberman.
*  Today's episode is also brought to us by 8 Sleep.
*  8 Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling, heating
*  and sleep tracking capacity.
*  So I've talked about many times before on the podcast,
*  there's a critical relationship between sleep and temperature
*  and indeed between waking up and temperature.
*  That is your body temperature needs to decrease
*  by about one to three degrees in order for you to fall
*  and stay deeply asleep at night.
*  And when you wake up in the morning,
*  in order to do that feeling refreshed,
*  your body temperature actually needs to increase
*  by about one to three degrees.
*  So it's critical that you control the temperature
*  of your sleeping environment
*  and that that temperature be controlled very specifically
*  across the night and into the morning.
*  With 8 Sleep mattress covers,
*  that's all extremely easy to do.
*  You can program the temperature of your mattress
*  in the beginning, middle and throughout the night
*  and when you wake up.
*  I've been sleeping on an 8 Sleep mattress cover
*  for over a year now
*  and it has greatly improved the quality of my sleep
*  and indeed I know that
*  because 8 Sleep also includes a terrific sleep tracker
*  built directly into that mattress cover.
*  If you'd like to try 8 Sleep,
*  you can go to 8sleep.com slash Huberman
*  to save $150 off their pod three cover.
*  8 Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, UK,
*  select countries in the EU and Australia.
*  Again, that's 8sleep.com slash Huberman.
*  And now for my discussion with Dr. Oded Rouhavi.
*  Oded, thank you so much for being here.
*  Totally my pleasure.
*  Yeah, this podcast has a somewhat unusual origin
*  because I am familiar with your work
*  but we essentially met on Twitter
*  where you are known for many things
*  but lately especially you have been focusing
*  not just on the discoveries in your laboratory
*  and other laboratories
*  but also sort of meme type humor
*  that relates to the scientific process.
*  And we'll return to this a little bit later.
*  But first of all, I think it's wonderful
*  that you're so active on social media
*  in this positive stance around science
*  that also includes humor.
*  But today what I mainly want to talk about
*  is the incredible questions that you probe in your lab
*  which are highly unusual, incredibly significant
*  for each and all of our lives and very controversial.
*  And at times even a little bit dangerous or morbid.
*  So this is going to be a fun one for me
*  and for the audience.
*  Just to start off very basically,
*  you get everyone up to speed
*  because people have different backgrounds.
*  I think most people have a general understanding
*  of what genes are, what RNA is and so on.
*  But maybe you could explain to people in very basic terms.
*  And I'll just preface all this by saying
*  that I think most people understand
*  that if they have two blue-eyed parents,
*  that there's a higher probability
*  that their offspring will have blue eyes than brown eyes.
*  Similarly, if two brown-eyed parents,
*  higher probability that they have brown eyes
*  rather than blue eyes and so on.
*  But that most people generally understand and accept
*  that if they spend part of their life,
*  let's say studying architecture,
*  that if they have children,
*  that there's no real genetic reason, we assume,
*  that their children would somehow be better at architecture
*  because they contain the knowledge
*  through the DNA of their parents.
*  They might be exposed to it in the home,
*  so-called nature nurture,
*  there's a nurture in that case,
*  but that they wouldn't inherit knowledge or other traits.
*  And today I'm hoping you can explain to us why eye color
*  but not knowledge is thought to be inherited.
*  And the huge landscape of interesting questions
*  that this opens up, including some evidence
*  that contrary to what we might think,
*  certain types of knowledge at the level of cells
*  and systems can be inherited.
*  So that was a very long-winded opening,
*  but to frame things up, what is DNA?
*  What is RNA and how does inheritance really work?
*  Okay, so DNA is the material, the genetic instructions
*  that is containing every one of our cells.
*  We have the set of genes
*  containing the entire set is called the genome.
*  And this is present in every cell of our body,
*  the same set of instructions.
*  And genes are made of DNA and they also contain,
*  and chromosomes, they are containing chromosomes,
*  is the DNA and the proteins that condense the DNA
*  because we have a huge amount of DNA in every cell
*  that you need to condense it to.
*  Sort of like thread on a spool.
*  Right, huge amounts that you have to condense.
*  And we have the same genome,
*  the same DNA in every cell in our body.
*  Can I just interrupt and I'll do that periodically
*  just to make sure that people are being carried along.
*  I sometimes find that even remarkable
*  that a skin cell and a brain cell,
*  a neuron for instance, very different functions,
*  but they all contain the full menu of genes
*  and the same menu of genes.
*  No, it is amazing.
*  It is amazing and perhaps it's good to have an analogy
*  to understand how it works.
*  So this is, I hope this is not a commercial,
*  but this is like the Ikea book
*  that you have in every cell in your body,
*  the instructions to make everything
*  that you need in your house, the chairs, the kitchen,
*  the pictures, but in every room you want something else.
*  So in the kitchen you want things that fit the kitchen
*  and in the toilet you want things that fit the toilet.
*  So you only remove one particular page of instructions,
*  which is the instructions of how to build a chair.
*  And this you place in the living room.
*  And in the toilet you put in the toilet.
*  So the DNA is the instruction to make the genome,
*  is the instruction to make everything.
*  This is the Ikea book.
*  And in every cell we take just the instructions
*  for make one particular furniture
*  and this is the RNA.
*  This is the RNA, this is the set.
*  And then the end you'll build the chair,
*  the chair is the protein.
*  So the RNA is our instructions to make one particular protein
*  based on the entire set of possibilities.
*  And this is true for one particular type of RNA,
*  which won't be the style of this conversation,
*  which is messenger RNA.
*  This is the RNA that contains information
*  for making proteins.
*  In fact, this is just a small percent of the RNA in the cell.
*  So we have a very big genome
*  and less than 2% of it encodes for this messenger RNA.
*  However, a lot of the genome is transcribed
*  to make RNA that does other things.
*  Some of these RNAs we understand
*  and many of them we don't.
*  I think it's a beautiful description
*  and Ikea is not a sponsor of the podcast.
*  So it's totally fair game to use the Ikea catalog
*  as the analogy for DNA,
*  the specific instructions for specific pieces of furniture
*  is the RNA and the furniture pieces being the proteins
*  that are essentially made from RNA using messenger RNA.
*  Okay, thank you for that.
*  So despite the fact that the same genes are contained
*  in all the cells of the body,
*  there is a difference between certain cell types, right?
*  Is it fair to say that there's basically
*  one very important exception,
*  which is somatic cells versus germ cells?
*  And would you mind sharing with us
*  what that distinction is?
*  So yes, every cell type is different
*  because it expresses, it brings into action
*  different genes from the entire collection
*  and assumes an identity.
*  And so we have cells in the legs,
*  we have cells in the brain,
*  we have cells that produce dopamine,
*  cells that produce serotonin and so on.
*  And we can make different separations,
*  different distinctions,
*  but we can make one very important distinction
*  between the somatic cells and the germ cells.
*  The germ cells are supposed to be the only cells
*  that contributes to the next generation,
*  out of which the next generation will be made.
*  So each of us is made just from a combination
*  of a sperm and an egg.
*  These are two types of germ cells.
*  And then they fuse and you get one fertilized egg.
*  And out of this one cell,
*  all the rest of the body will develop.
*  And what happens in the soma,
*  which are all the cells that are not the germ cells,
*  should stay in the soma.
*  Should not be able to contribute to the next generation.
*  This is very important.
*  And it's thought to be one of the main barriers
*  for the inheritance of acquired traits,
*  inheritance of memory and so on.
*  Because for example,
*  like the example that you gave with learning architecture,
*  if I learn about architecture,
*  the information is encoded in my brain.
*  And since my brain cells can't transfer information
*  to the sperm and the egg,
*  because the information is supposed to reside
*  in synaptic connections between different neurons,
*  in particular circuits that developed.
*  So what happens in the brain
*  shouldn't be able to transfer to the next generation.
*  Even simpler, a simpler example,
*  if you go to the gym and you build up muscles,
*  you know that your kids will have to work out on their own.
*  It won't, this short out won't happen.
*  This is something that we know intuitively,
*  and even if we don't have any background in biology.
*  And this is connected to the fact that,
*  as we said at the beginning,
*  every cell in the body has its own genome.
*  And the next generation will only form
*  from the combination of the genomes in the sperm and the egg.
*  Even if you somehow acquire the mutation
*  or a change in your DNA in one of particular brain cells,
*  it wouldn't matter because this mutation,
*  there's no way to transfer it to the DNA of the germ cells
*  that will contribute to the next generation.
*  So despite that, there is, as you will tell us,
*  some evidence for inheritance of experience, let's call it.
*  And here we have to be careful with the language, right?
*  And I just want to put a big asterisk and underline
*  and a highlight that the language around
*  what we're about to talk about is both confusing
*  and at the same time, fairly simple and controversial, right?
*  It's a little bit like in the field of longevity.
*  People sometimes will say anti-aging,
*  some people say longevity.
*  The anti-aging folks feel that longevity
*  is more about longevity clinics.
*  They don't like that.
*  Anti-aging is related to some other kind of niche clinics.
*  Sometimes FDA approved or government approved, sometimes not.
*  And so there's a lot of argument about the naming,
*  but it's all about living longer and living healthier.
*  In this field of acquiring traits
*  or the passage of information to offspring,
*  what is the proper language to refer
*  to what we're about to discuss?
*  There is this idea, and I'll say it so that you don't have to,
*  that dates back to Lamarck and Lamarckian evolution,
*  very controversial, right?
*  And maybe not even controversial.
*  I think it's very offensive even to certain people.
*  This idea of inheritance of acquired traits,
*  the idea that one could change themselves
*  through some activity, use the example of going to the gym.
*  We could also use the example of somebody
*  who becomes an endurance runner,
*  then decides to have children within another endurance runner
*  and has in mind the idea that because they did all this
*  running and not just because they were biased
*  towards running in the first place,
*  but because of the distance they actually ran
*  that their offspring somehow would be fabulous runners.
*  Okay, this Lamarckian concept is, we believe, wrong.
*  So how do we talk about inheritance of acquired traits?
*  What's the proper language for us to frame this discussion?
*  We have to be very careful, as you said,
*  and there are many complications and many ambiguities.
*  And maybe you could tell us why Lamarckian evolution,
*  for those that don't know, is such a stained thing.
*  Right.
*  So it's not polite.
*  Right, perhaps we'll start with just to say
*  that we can talk about inheritance of acquired traits,
*  transmission of parental responses, inheritance of memory,
*  all of these things, and we can also talk about epigenetics
*  and transgenerational epigenetics
*  and intergenerational epigenetics.
*  There are many terms that we need to make clear
*  for the audience.
*  The reason that it's so toxic or controversial
*  is very complicated and goes a long time back,
*  even way before Lamarck.
*  So even the Greeks talked about inheritance of acquired traits.
*  Lamarck is associated with the term,
*  but it's probably a mistake, although everyone talks about it,
*  including people who study it.
*  So Lamarck worked, he published his book
*  about a little more than 200 years ago,
*  and he believed in inheritance of acquired traits, absolutely,
*  but just like anyone else in his time.
*  Just everyone believed in it.
*  It seemed obvious to them that it was long before Mendel
*  and the rules of genetic inheritance,
*  and also Mendel was long before the understanding
*  that DNA is the heritable material.
*  So this happened a long time ago.
*  Everyone believed in it, including Darwin.
*  Darwin was perhaps more Lamarck than Lamarck.
*  Really? Yes, absolutely.
*  All right, now we're getting into the meat of it.
*  And this is in the origin of the species.
*  It's in all of his writings.
*  Lamarck didn't even really make the distinction
*  between the generations.
*  He had many other reasons for being wrong,
*  but he connected the terms
*  in heritance of acquired traits to evolution,
*  and this is some of the reasons
*  that he was very controversial even in his time.
*  There were other reasons, for example,
*  he rejected current-day chemistry
*  and thought that he can explain everything
*  based on Aristotelian fluids, earth, wind, fire, and water.
*  There's still some people on the internet
*  that think they can discard with chemistry
*  and explain everything based on earth, wind, fire, and water.
*  This wasn't only biology,
*  it was also the weather and everything.
*  So that was part of the reason.
*  But Lamarck, so Lamarck made many mistakes,
*  but he did have a full tier of inheritance,
*  which was a big step towards where we are today.
*  So he had important contributions, nevertheless.
*  Although he was mistaken about the mechanism,
*  what he believed, like everyone else,
*  drives evolution is the transmission of the traits
*  that you acquire during your life
*  or the things that you do or don't do.
*  He talked about use and disuse of certain organs
*  that shape our organs
*  and eventually also the organs of the next generation.
*  He sounds a little bit like
*  the first self-help public figure, right?
*  Well, this idea, I mean, this is heavily embedded
*  into a lot of the health and fitness space
*  on Twitter and Instagram and on the internet,
*  which is that, and it's the idea that we're sold
*  very early in life, at least here in the United States
*  and probably elsewhere, which is that we can become anything
*  that we want to become,
*  and then that will forever change the offspring,
*  either because of nature or nurture.
*  Right, and this is a very dangerous idea,
*  as I'll explain in a second, and it led to horrible things.
*  This is part of the reason that this is such a taboo.
*  It's not only self-help,
*  that you're helping your, or this helping yourself.
*  The problem is when you apply it to others,
*  and this happened in a very, very dramatic
*  and horrible way in the recent past,
*  as I'll tell you in a second.
*  So Lamarck, this is what he believed,
*  and he thought this is how evolution progresses,
*  and later Darwin showed that it's really natural selection,
*  the selecting of the people, of the organisms
*  that already contain the particular qualities
*  are selected based on whether they survive
*  or not in particular environments,
*  and therefore the evolution progresses,
*  they become more common and take over.
*  This is very different, two different explanations.
*  The most common way this is contrasted
*  is the neck of the giraffes.
*  This is the classic example.
*  According to Lamarck, the giraffes had to stretch
*  their necks towards the trees to eat
*  when the trees were high, and because of that,
*  they transmitted these traits long necks
*  to their children who also had long necks.
*  By the way, he only mentioned this example
*  a handful of times, he didn't really focus on that.
*  And according to Darwin, just a giraffe
*  that happened to be born with a long neck
*  survived because it ate, so it's genetic,
*  heritable material, I didn't know about genetics,
*  but take over, and the rest of the giraffes
*  that have different heritable materials just die.
*  So this is natural selection versus inheritance
*  for quire traits.
*  There are many reasons why Lamarckism
*  and inheritance for quire traits became such a bad term.
*  One of the biggest is what happened in the Soviet Union.
*  Under Stalin, there was a scientist called Lisenko
*  who thought that Mendelism, normal genetics
*  is bourgeois science, it shouldn't be done.
*  And whoever did normal genetics was either killed
*  or sent to Siberia.
*  And he thought that, just like you said,
*  not only we can become everything that we want,
*  but we can grow everything that we want in every field.
*  We can take frozen field and grow potatoes there and so on.
*  And this led to massive starvation,
*  ruin agriculture in the Soviet Union,
*  also ruin science for many, many years,
*  and put a very dark cloud on the entire field.
*  And only probably in the 80s or something like this,
*  the field started to recuperate for that.
*  Aside from that, which is a very dramatic thing,
*  there was also crazy stories around
*  and attempts to prove the inheritance of quire traits.
*  Despite the realization of many scientists,
*  this is something that is very rare
*  or that normally doesn't happen.
*  As if it is not a normal way that inheritance works.
*  And I can tell you about two such dramatic cases
*  that will illustrate it.
*  Yeah, please.
*  So in the beginning of the 20th century in Vienna,
*  there was a researcher called Paul Kammerer.
*  He was a very famous and also very colorful figure
*  who did experiments on many different types of animals.
*  He did experiments on toads that are called the midwife toad
*  because the male carries the eggs.
*  There's a beautiful book about it from Kessler
*  telling the story of what happened there.
*  And there are a couple of types of toads.
*  Some of them live underwater and some of them live on land.
*  And these toads are different in their shape
*  and in their behavior.
*  So of course, the capacity to live underwater is one thing,
*  but also the morphology and appearance changes.
*  The toads that live underwater develop these nupital pads,
*  these black pads on their hands that allow the males
*  to grab onto the female without slipping.
*  Formating.
*  Formating.
*  And the ones on land don't have them.
*  He claimed that he can take the toads and train them
*  to live underwater, changing the temperature
*  and all kinds of things.
*  It's a very difficult animal to work with.
*  Eventually, according to Kammerer,
*  they will acquire the capacity to live underwater
*  and also change their physiology
*  and develop these black nupital pads on their heads.
*  With this discovery, he traveled the world,
*  became very famous.
*  This was just the beginning of the previous century.
*  As the person who found the proof for inheritance
*  of acquired traits, despite the controversy and so on.
*  And in the beginning of the realization
*  of how it actually works with DNA and so on.
*  Not with DNA, but with natural selection.
*  DNA came later.
*  And people didn't believe him.
*  He was actually under a lot of attacks,
*  but it seemed convincing.
*  At the end, what happened is that they found
*  that he injected ink to the toads
*  to make them become black, to have this nupital pad.
*  So he faked the results.
*  And he couldn't stand up with the accusations
*  and kill himself.
*  In this book by Kessler, it's just maybe it was
*  the assistant who did it.
*  Who killed him?
*  No, no.
*  Who injected it to sort of save him from,
*  because the samples lost the coloring or something.
*  So it might be, who knows what happened.
*  Well, in science, whenever there's a fraud,
*  accusation or controversy,
*  it's not uncommon to see a passing of responsibility.
*  There are recent cases, there are ongoing cases now
*  where it's a question of who did what, et cetera.
*  Actually, I have two questions before the second story.
*  I'm struck by the idea that he was traveling and talking.
*  I'm guessing this was before PowerPoint and Keynote,
*  but also before transparencies,
*  which actually were still in place
*  when I was a graduate student.
*  For those of you who don't know transparency,
*  they're basically transparent pieces of plastic paper
*  that you put onto a projector,
*  and then you can write on them and do demonstrations,
*  but can show photographs and things like that.
*  So how was he giving these talks,
*  and would he travel with the toes?
*  So he traveled with the samples.
*  I see.
*  And I'm basing this on this Kessler book,
*  which is on its own very controversial.
*  It's more of a beautiful story than perhaps the truth.
*  But, and according to the story there,
*  he had to stand one side of the lecture hall
*  with his hands behind the back,
*  while others would examine the samples
*  and pass them around and so on.
*  But he cheated, someone cheated.
*  He probably did it.
*  At least that's what most people think.
*  This wasn't replicated.
*  I mean, also, I don't think anyone tried to replicate it.
*  Interesting.
*  This is just a point about replication,
*  and actually another tragic example,
*  not but a few years ago, Sakai,
*  who as far as we knew was doing very accomplished work
*  on the growth of retinas,
*  literally growing eyes in a dish.
*  I think everyone believes that result.
*  But then there were some accusations about another result
*  that turned out to be fraudulent, and Sakai killed himself.
*  This was a recent,
*  this was only about maybe five, 10 years ago.
*  So it still happens.
*  Yeah, it happened.
*  I think it's rare, but it does happen,
*  especially in this very high profile.
*  I would argue, I'd love to know what your number is,
*  but I would argue that 99% of scientists are seeking truth
*  and are well-meaning, honest people.
*  I totally agree.
*  And I think that even when people are wrong,
*  it's mostly not because they're evil and trying to act.
*  Like, maybe they really want to believe the results,
*  or there are all kinds of ways to be wrong,
*  and even to bend truth without just blatant fraud.
*  But this is, according to the story,
*  an example of very bad fraud,
*  which I agree is rare because most scientists, as you said,
*  it's also my opinion, are just trying to discover truth
*  and do the best they can.
*  Well, why else would you go into it?
*  Because it's certainly not a profession to go into
*  if you want to get rich.
*  It's not the money.
*  And it's probably not even a profession to go into
*  if you want to get famous.
*  If you want to be famous, you should go to Hollywood
*  or become a serial killer,
*  because they'll make specials about it.
*  Please don't.
*  But please don't do either.
*  No, Hollywood, I suppose, for some is fine.
*  But in any case, okay, so camera around 1907, 1906?
*  This is slightly before.
*  The controversy broke out after the First World War.
*  Okay, great.
*  So the camera is gone.
*  His toads with their either ink or whatever, nupital pads,
*  they have to go back to mating on land.
*  Okay, I'd like to take a quick break
*  and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.
*  Athletic Greens, now called AG1,
*  is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
*  that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.
*  I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,
*  so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
*  The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
*  and the reason I still take Athletic Greens once
*  or usually twice a day is that it gets to be the probiotics
*  that I need for gut health.
*  Our gut is very important.
*  It's populated by gut microbiota that communicate
*  with the brain, the immune system,
*  and basically all the biological systems of our body
*  to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.
*  And those probiotics and Athletic Greens are optimal
*  and vital for microbiotic health.
*  In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number
*  of adaptogens, vitamins, and minerals that make sure
*  that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met.
*  And it tastes great.
*  If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
*  you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman,
*  and they'll give you five free travel packs
*  that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens
*  while you're on the road, in the car, on the plane, et cetera.
*  And they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
*  Again, that's athleticgreens.com slash Huberman
*  to get the five free travel packs
*  and the year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
*  So this is, forget about that.
*  We also had the Lisenko episode.
*  That's a very big thing.
*  And then in the US, there was in the 70s and 80s,
*  a researcher named McConnell,
*  who did very different experiments,
*  and he was also a character.
*  He worked on, so he was the Joker type of thing,
*  and he published many of his results
*  in a journal that he published
*  that was called Worms Breeders Gazette
*  and had many cartoons and things like that.
*  So he started his own journal.
*  I guess.
*  It's one way to publish a lot.
*  But he also published in very respected journals in parallel.
*  But he was a psychologist, American psychologist,
*  and he worked on a worm, a flat worm,
*  which is called planaria, which is very interesting.
*  This is different than what we'll discuss today,
*  different type of worm.
*  You know worms are.
*  Are very common.
*  So four out of five animals on this planet is a worm.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, numerically.
*  It's just counting the individuals.
*  So we are the exception.
*  But I'll talk about a very different worm later.
*  This is a flat worm.
*  This is called planaria.
*  And it is remarkable in many ways.
*  It was also a model that many people worked on,
*  including the fathers of genetics,
*  the people who started genetics like Morgan.
*  They worked on it in the beginning,
*  but it's very, very hard to study genetics in this worm
*  because unlike us, unlike what we explained before
*  about how we all develop from sperm and egg,
*  these worms most of the time reproduce just by fission.
*  They tear themselves apart.
*  So they have a head and a tail,
*  and the part of the head would just tear itself apart
*  from the tail, the head will grow a new tail,
*  the tail will grow a new head.
*  You can even cut them to 200 pieces.
*  Each piece will grow into a new worm.
*  Wow.
*  And they have centralized brains with lobes and everything,
*  and even degenerate eyes.
*  He studied these worms,
*  and he said that he can teach them certain things,
*  associations by pairing all,
*  I don't remember exactly what he did.
*  I think it was either lights or electricity with-
*  Shock them.
*  Which would shock them with other things,
*  and he could train them to learn
*  and remember particular things.
*  Like you might get shocked on one side of the tank,
*  and then avoid that side of the tank.
*  And then I guess the question is whether or not
*  they're ripped apart selves
*  and their subsequent generations will know
*  to avoid that side of the tank
*  without having ever been exposed to the shock.
*  Right.
*  So without ever being exposed to shock,
*  or whether the new generation, the new heads,
*  will be able to learn faster.
*  That's another, the subtlety that you might have.
*  Okay.
*  And this is what he said he happened.
*  He said he can teach them certain things,
*  remove cut of their heads,
*  and new heads with all the brain will grow,
*  and that it will contain the memory.
*  This was the start of the controversy.
*  Not the end of it, only the beginning.
*  Then he said something even much wilder,
*  which is he can train them to learn certain things,
*  and then just chop them up,
*  put them in a blender,
*  and feed them to other worms,
*  because they are cannibalistic, they eat each other,
*  and that the memory will transfer through feeding.
*  This sounds-
*  Such a dramatic field.
*  Yeah.
*  And by the way, this opened the field.
*  So people did experiments that not only in planaria,
*  but in goldfish and certain rodents,
*  and did these memory brain transfer essays
*  in planting brain.
*  And this is in the,
*  back when they had an idea that some memories
*  could be molecular, could have a molecular form,
*  which is very appealing.
*  It's almost like science fiction.
*  You could have a memory in a tube.
*  Unlike the way we think about memory normally,
*  which is something that is distributed in neuronal circuits,
*  and encoded in the strength of particular synapses,
*  and so on.
*  But the idea that you can take a memory
*  and reduce it into a molecule,
*  and transfer it around is very, very interesting.
*  So this is why it's attracted so many people.
*  This ended up in a catastrophe.
*  So there was an NIH investigation.
*  No one can replicate anything.
*  It was a big mess.
*  Although there were always scientists who said,
*  yes, we can replicate this and this.
*  So they were in the background.
*  McConnell stuff was different.
*  Again, people thought that they couldn't,
*  that there are problems replicating,
*  but it wasn't necessarily, but some people replicate,
*  but it wasn't necessarily about replicating the whole thing.
*  But the question was,
*  did the memory, the transfer is specific,
*  or is it an overall sensitization that transmits, and so on?
*  Right, like you could imagine that what gets transmitted
*  is a hypersensitivity to electricity,
*  as opposed to the specific location
*  that the electricity was introduced.
*  Or even more than that, even just, you know,
*  a hypersensitivity in general,
*  you're more vigilant, and you'll learn anything faster.
*  That's also a possibility.
*  But his problem wasn't the accusation.
*  It was much worse that he was targeted by the Unabomber,
*  these terrorists who sent letters with bombs
*  to many scientists for 15 years.
*  And his assistant, again, he's the assistant,
*  I think exploded, and this is how his line of research ended.
*  Just recently, a few years ago,
*  a researcher from Boston, Mike Levin,
*  and his postdoc, Tal Shomrat,
*  replicated some of McConnell's experiment
*  with the cutting of the head,
*  but using very fancy equipment and automated tracking.
*  And they could say that they can replicate
*  some of his experiments.
*  Really?
*  And they don't open packages in that laboratory.
*  They have interesting stories.
*  You should have Mike over.
*  Yeah, I'm familiar with a bit of his work.
*  I didn't realize they had done that experiment.
*  They published it a few years ago.
*  And it's very interesting,
*  but of course they don't know how it happens.
*  The mechanism is unclear.
*  McConnell went a step further than this.
*  And what's fascinating is that these are experiments
*  that were done in the 70s and 80s.
*  He said that he cannot only transfer the memories
*  through chopped animals,
*  but he can take the animals that learned
*  and break it down into different fractions.
*  So just the DNA, just the RNA, just the fats,
*  the proteins, the sugars.
*  And he said that the fraction that transmit the memory
*  is the RNA.
*  And this is very, very interesting
*  because it was a long time before everything
*  that we know about RNA today.
*  I'll soon go into my research, explain what we do,
*  and then you'll see that you can actually feed worms
*  with RNA and have many things happen.
*  And this is, everyone knows this is true.
*  So this is why it was so appealing
*  to go back to that and study.
*  By the way, at the time it became popular knowledge.
*  Everyone knew this experiment.
*  There's a Star Trek episode about it from 84.
*  There are comics books about it, books about it.
*  So this was very, and people were eating RNA
*  because they thought that there's RNA in memory.
*  This was of course complete nonsense.
*  But this was, it made a lot of noise in these years,
*  which is part of the reason it was so toxic until recently.
*  You couldn't touch it because it was considered
*  pseudoscience, like Lisenko, like Kammerer and all of this.
*  So this was just something you didn't wanna touch at all.
*  And then we go back to these studies
*  about inheritance of memory or inheritance of acquired traits
*  in other organisms, in mammals, in humans.
*  And aside from the dark clouds,
*  that these episodes left,
*  there were also theoretical problems
*  of why this can't happen.
*  Barriers that have to be breached for this to happen.
*  And you can talk about many different types of barriers.
*  And you can also narrow it down to two main barriers.
*  First barrier, we mentioned it.
*  This is the separation of the soma from the germline.
*  Right, the somatic cells, they can change
*  in response to experience the sperm and the egg,
*  the so-called germ cells cannot.
*  That's the idea.
*  Or they are isolated from what happens in the soma.
*  The man who first thought about this barrier
*  is called Weizmann, August Weizmann.
*  This was in the 19th century.
*  So it is called today the Weizmann barrier.
*  Separation of the soma from the germline,
*  only the germline transmitting from it
*  to the next generation.
*  And this is also called the second law of biology.
*  So this is very, very fundamental.
*  So natural selection is the first one.
*  This is the second one, because it's so important to how we
*  work, to how our bodies work.
*  Weizmann, by the way, thought that if you
*  will have direct influence of the environment
*  on the germ cells, then perhaps this could transfer
*  to the next generation.
*  So he wasn't as strict as his barriers suggest.
*  But this is not how most people remember it.
*  But he thought that this is unnecessary.
*  It's possible that natural selection
*  can explain everything.
*  And he compared to a boat which is in the ocean.
*  It is sailing, and it has a sail open.
*  So you don't have to assume that it has an engine.
*  The wind is blowing.
*  You don't have to assume other things.
*  The natural selection might be enough.
*  So this barrier is still standing, but not entirely.
*  It is rich in some organisms.
*  We'll go into that in a second.
*  The other barrier is that now we have
*  to understand the other barrier.
*  We have to talk about epigenetics.
*  We have to define epigenetics and what it is.
*  And epigenetics is another term which people misuse horribly
*  and say about everything that is epigenetics, even people
*  from the field.
*  The word itself, the term was defined in the 40s
*  by Konrad Wellington.
*  And he talked about the interaction between genes
*  and their products that in the end bring about the phenotype,
*  or the consequences, and how genes influence development.
*  Later, people discovered mechanisms
*  that change the action of genes.
*  There are different mechanisms.
*  And started talking about these as epigenetics.
*  For example, the DNA is built out of four basic elements.
*  It's all the AT, GNC.
*  And they can be chemically modified.
*  So in addition to just the information
*  that you have in the sequence of the DNA,
*  you also have the information in the modification of the basis.
*  The most common modification that has been studied more than others
*  is the modification of the letter C of cytosine,
*  methylation, the addition of a methyl group to this C.
*  And this can be replicated.
*  So after the DNA, the cells divide and replicate
*  their genetic material.
*  In certain cases, also, these chemical modifications
*  can be added on and replicated and be preserved.
*  For those who aren't as familiar with thinking about genes
*  and gene structure and epigenetics,
*  could we think of these?
*  You mentioned the four nucleotide bases, TGAD.
*  But could we imagine that through things like methylation,
*  it's sort of like taking the primary colors
*  and changing one of them a little bit,
*  changing the hue just slightly, which then opens up
*  an enormous number of new options of color integration?
*  Absolutely.
*  Just more combinations, more ways, more information.
*  There are the modifications of the DNA.
*  And also, there are the modifications
*  of the proteins which condense the DNA that
*  are called histones.
*  So they are also modified by many different chemicals.
*  Again, methylation is a very common modification.
*  Cetylation, even serotonin, the serotonilation of histones.
*  Serotonin.
*  Right.
*  This is a new paper from Nature from a few years ago.
*  Can change DNA.
*  Not the DNA itself, but the protein that condenses it.
*  Essentially how, in the analogy I used before,
*  of how the thread is wrapped around the spool, essentially.
*  Yes.
*  And this determines the degree of condensation of the DNA,
*  whether the gene is now more or less accessible,
*  and therefore can perhaps be expressed more or less.
*  This is one way to affect the gene expression
*  and bring about the function of the gene.
*  There are many additional ways.
*  Not the only one.
*  So when all of this was starting to be lucidated,
*  people talked about epigenetics.
*  They started talking about these modifications.
*  Forgot the original definition.
*  And when people said epigenetics,
*  they talk about methylation and things like that.
*  And again, to just frame this up,
*  we can imagine two identical twins,
*  so-called monozygotic twins.
*  We could go a step further and say
*  that they're monochlorionic if they were
*  in the same placental sac, because twins
*  can be raised in separate sacs, slightly
*  different early environments.
*  Let's say those two twins are raised separately.
*  One experiences certain things.
*  The other things, they eat different foods, et cetera.
*  And there is the possibility through epigenetic mechanisms
*  that through methylation, acetylation, serotonin
*  production, et cetera, that the expression
*  of certain genes in one of the twins
*  could be amplified relative to the other.
*  So we know that even totally identical twins,
*  genetically they're identical, but they look different
*  and they are different.
*  We all experience it.
*  And this can happen because of these epigenetic changes.
*  Or it can happen because of other mechanisms.
*  Because genes respond to the environment.
*  Genes don't exist in a vacuum.
*  Genes need to be activated by transcription factors.
*  And there's a lot of machinery that is responsible for making
*  genes function.
*  So we are a combination of our genetic material
*  and the environment.
*  So when people talk about epigenetics
*  and talk just about the modification,
*  they're also not exactly right.
*  My definition of epigenetics is inheritance,
*  which occurs either across cell division or, more
*  interestingly also for this podcast now,
*  across generations, not because of changes to the DNA sequence
*  but through other mechanisms.
*  I think this is the most robust definition that
*  allows you to understand what you're talking about.
*  And then again, and then the question is, if this happens,
*  then what are the molecules that actually
*  transmit information across generations?
*  Are they these chemical modifications to the DNA
*  or to the proteins that condense the DNA?
*  Or are there other agents that transmit the information?
*  And which molecules can do it?
*  And I actually think that the most interesting players today
*  are RNA molecules.
*  But before I go into that, I just
*  want to say that when we talk about the barriers
*  to epigenetic inheritance or the barriers
*  to inheritance of acquired traits,
*  in addition to the separation of the soma from the germline
*  that we discussed, the other main barrier,
*  it's called epigenetic reprogramming, which
*  is that we acquired our cells, the genetic material
*  in our cells acquires all kinds of changes,
*  these chemical changes, modifications we discussed.
*  But these modifications are largely
*  erased in the transition between generations.
*  So in the germline, in the sperm and the egg,
*  and also in the early embryo, most of the modifications
*  are removed so we can start a blank slate based
*  on the genetic instructions.
*  And this is crucial.
*  Otherwise, according to the theory,
*  it's not clear that actually true, because in some organisms
*  it doesn't really happen.
*  We will not develop according to the species
*  typical genetic instructions.
*  So to preserve this, we erase all these modifications
*  that start anew.
*  And this is in mammals and in humans.
*  This is largely true.
*  Most of the modifications in the sperm and in the egg
*  are removed, so about 90% of them.
*  Some remain, which could be interesting.
*  So the idea, if I understand correctly,
*  is that there's some advantage to wiping the slate clean
*  and returning to the original plan.
*  In the context of the IKEA furniture analogy,
*  the instruction book is the one that's issued to everybody,
*  okay, or every cell, right?
*  Only certain instructions are used for certain cells,
*  say a skin cell or a neuron or a liver cell
*  or any other cell for that matter.
*  Through the course of the lifespan of the organism,
*  those specific instructions are adjusted somewhat.
*  Okay, so maybe like IKEA furniture,
*  sometimes they send you seven, not eight
*  of particular screws where they send you the proper number,
*  but you put them in the wrong place
*  and it sort of changes the way
*  that the thing works a little bit.
*  Once that assuming furniture could reproduce,
*  but here in the analogy of the furniture as the cell
*  or the organ in that mates with another organism,
*  that needs to be replicated.
*  And so the idea is to take the instruction book,
*  go through and erase all the pen and pencil marks,
*  erase all those additional little modifications
*  that the owner used or introduced to it
*  and return to the original instruction.
*  Right, because if you want to bring back the instruction book,
*  you want it to have all the potential
*  to make all the furnitures.
*  You don't want it to be restricted to the ones
*  that you made in a particular room.
*  So it's essentially the opposite of acquired traits
*  and characteristics based on your,
*  what we say in biology, geeks speak,
*  lineage-based experience,
*  but what your parents experience, right?
*  In some ways, we want to eliminate all that
*  and go back to just the genes they provided.
*  Yes, but it's more complicated than that.
*  It's more complicated than that
*  because we have some very striking examples,
*  even in memes, where some of the marks are maintained.
*  For example, the classic example is imprinting.
*  Imprinting is a very interesting phenomena.
*  The way DNA works is that you inherit a copy
*  for every chromosome from your mother and your father.
*  And then you have in every cell of your body,
*  two copies, if you're a human, of every chromosome.
*  And then, so every gene is represented twice.
*  These are called alleles,
*  the different versions of the genes.
*  And the thought is that once you enter in the next generation,
*  the two copies that you inherited are equal.
*  It doesn't matter whether you acquire them
*  from your mother or from your father, right?
*  There are some situations where it does matter.
*  There is a limited number of genes
*  that are called imprinted genes,
*  where it does matter whether you inherited
*  from your mother or your father.
*  And this is happening through epigenetic inheritance,
*  not because of changes to the DNA sequence,
*  but because of maintenance
*  of these chemical modifications across generations.
*  And as I recall from the beautiful work
*  of Catherine Dulac at Harvard,
*  that especially in the brain,
*  there is evidence that some cells contain
*  the complete genome from mom or the complete genome from dad.
*  And it can also switch during your life.
*  So for her work showed that early on in your life,
*  it's different whether you express the maternal
*  or paternal copy than when you're more mature.
*  So parents and children take note, you know,
*  for those of you that are saying,
*  oh, you know, the child is more like you or more like me,
*  that can change across the lifespan.
*  And then if you're thinking about your parental lineage
*  and wondering whether or not you quote unquote,
*  inherited some sort of trait from mother or from father,
*  it can be of course both,
*  or it can be just one or just the other,
*  which I think most parents tend to see and describe
*  in their children from time to time.
*  That's just like the father,
*  or that's just like the mother, for instance.
*  Right, right.
*  But it's important to note that in this situation,
*  the environment played no role.
*  This was just whether it passed to the mother or the father.
*  It's not that something that happened to the mother
*  or the father affected this.
*  So this is slightly different.
*  The question is now,
*  can the environment change the hereditary material?
*  So it's very important to understand
*  that there is a difference between nurture and nature.
*  And this is very confusing.
*  People are, it's a little subtle.
*  So for example, people tell me,
*  I'm growing horses for many years,
*  and I just know that this horse has a particular character.
*  It's very different from the other horse.
*  And so this is epigenetic inheritance.
*  No, it could be just genetically determined.
*  Yes, this horse inherited a different set
*  of genetic instructions, so it is different.
*  Doesn't have to be about epigenetics.
*  Epigenetic inheritance means that the environment
*  of the parents somehow changed the children.
*  And there, there are these two main barriers
*  that are serious bottlenecks that we have to think
*  what type of molecule and how they can be bridged.
*  So one possibility is that it's really this limited number
*  of chemical modifications that survive,
*  which is about 10% or so.
*  That could be very interesting.
*  Not a small number.
*  Not a small number, but perhaps, perhaps.
*  This is one possibility.
*  The other possibility that there are other mechanisms.
*  The situation now in humans is that it's just really unclear
*  what transmits, if it can transmit,
*  and which molecule does it.
*  We'll talk later about other organisms
*  where it is a lot more clear.
*  But in humans and mammals in general,
*  there are many examples for environments
*  that change the children.
*  Whether you need to invoke an epigenetic mechanism
*  to explain this phenomena, this is unclear.
*  First of all, because it's hard to separate
*  nurture from nurture.
*  And second, because the mechanism is just not understood.
*  So there are classic examples.
*  For in humans, there were periods of famine,
*  starvation in different places in the world.
*  In the Netherlands, in China, in Russia,
*  where people did huge epidemiological study
*  to study the next generations and saw that the children
*  of women who were starved during pregnancy are different.
*  They're different in many ways.
*  They have different birth weight, glucose sensitivity,
*  and also some neurological,
*  higher chances of getting some neurological diseases.
*  And this has been shown in very large studies.
*  Is there ever an instance of which starvation
*  or hardship of some kind, some challenge,
*  sensory challenge or survival-based challenge
*  led to adaptive traits?
*  Yes, there are in different organisms.
*  It could be as a result of a trade-off.
*  So there could be a downside as well.
*  But for example, there are two examples that come into mind.
*  One of them is that if you stress male mice
*  or rats, I don't remember,
*  this is work of Isabelle Mansoui in the ETH in Switzerland.
*  If you stress the males, you can do it in many different ways.
*  I don't remember exactly how they did,
*  but you can separate them from their mothers.
*  You can do social defeat, all kinds of things.
*  Then the next generations are less stressed.
*  They show less anxiety.
*  So the threshold for stress is higher.
*  Yes, however, I think they have memory deficits
*  and other metabolic problems.
*  Which may be an advantage for dealing with stress.
*  I don't have any direct evidence of that,
*  but there's some simmering ideas that our ability
*  to anchor our thoughts in the past, present or future
*  seems very adaptive in certain contexts.
*  In other contexts, it can keep us ruminating
*  and not adaptively present to our current challenges.
*  Another example is that nicotine exposure.
*  This is, I think, the work of Oliver Rando from UMass.
*  If I'm not mistaken, these are not my studies,
*  but they improve the tolerance to exposure
*  to similar drugs in the next generation.
*  The interesting thing here is that it's very nonspecific.
*  So you treat them with nicotine,
*  but then in the next generation,
*  they are more tolerant to nicotine,
*  but also to other, I think, cocaine.
*  That sort of makes sense to me,
*  because obviously nicotine activates the cholinergic system,
*  the dopaminergic system, epinephrine, et cetera.
*  And you can imagine that there's crossover,
*  because other drugs like cocaine amphetamine
*  mainly target the catecholamines,
*  the dopamine and norepinephrine.
*  In this particular study, if I remember correctly,
*  they show that this happens, this heritable effect,
*  even if you use an antagonist to block the nicotine receptor.
*  Wow.
*  So it's something more about clearance of xenobiotics
*  and hepatic functions that is transmitted
*  and is very nonspecific.
*  What I love about all the examples you've given today,
*  and especially that one is, and I hope that people,
*  if you're just listening, I'm smiling,
*  because biology is so cryptic sometimes.
*  The obvious mechanism is rarely
*  the one that's actually at play.
*  And people always ask, well, why?
*  Why is it like this?
*  And I always say, the one thing I know for sure
*  is that I wasn't consulted at the design phase.
*  And if anyone claims they were,
*  then you definitely want to back away very fast.
*  And there could be so many trade-offs, so many trade-offs.
*  So for example, we studied,
*  and also many other people studied,
*  effects, these are in worms.
*  We'll go deep into that in a second,
*  but they show that when you starve them,
*  the next generations live longer.
*  And this, I think, could be a trade-off
*  with other things like fertility.
*  So the next generations are more sick and less fertile,
*  and perhaps because of this, they live longer.
*  So there could be, it's not necessarily a good thing.
*  I don't want to draw you off course,
*  because this is magnificent what you're doing
*  and splaying out for us here.
*  But do you recall, there was a few years ago,
*  it actually ended very tragically, it was an example.
*  I think it was down in San Diego County.
*  There was a cult of sorts
*  that were interested in living forever.
*  And so they castrated, the males self-castrated themselves
*  in the idea that somehow maintaining
*  some pre-pubescent state or reverting
*  to a pseudo pre-pubescent state
*  would somehow extend longevity.
*  The idea that sexual behavior somehow limited lifespan.
*  This has been an idea that's been thrown around
*  in the kind of more wacky longevity communities.
*  They also shaved their heads.
*  They also wore the same sneakers,
*  but then they also all committed suicide, right,
*  as the Hale-Bopp Comet came through town.
*  But that's just but one example of many cults aimed at sort of,
*  that obviously was not life extension,
*  that was life truncation,
*  but aimed at kind of eternal life
*  or some sort of through caloric restriction.
*  That's right, this cult also was very into the whole idea
*  that through caloric restriction, we can live much longer,
*  which may actually turn out to be true.
*  I think it's still debated.
*  Hence all the debate about intermittent fasting, et cetera.
*  But also it is known that if you overeat, you shorten life.
*  This is clear.
*  It's known that big bodied members of a species
*  live far shorter lives than the smaller members
*  of a Great Dane versus a Chihuahua, for instance.
*  So there is some like you sort of shards of truths
*  in all of these things,
*  but it seems to me that the real question is like,
*  what is the real mechanism
*  and why would something like this exist?
*  And why questions are very dangerous in biology, right?
*  Right, but very interesting also.
*  And so when it comes to metabolic changes and nutrition,
*  there are numerous examples
*  where you either overfeed or starve
*  and get effects in the next generations.
*  Many of them, sometimes the effects contrast
*  depending on the way you do this.
*  Again, these are none of, we don't do any of that in memos,
*  but people show that starving or overfeeding the mothers
*  or the fathers changes the body weight of the next generation
*  and also the glucose tolerance and other,
*  and also a productive success.
*  And so the fact that there's an effect,
*  that something transmits, this is clear.
*  The question is, how miraculous is it
*  and whether you need new biology and epigenetics
*  to explain it.
*  What do I mean by that?
*  If you affect the next generation,
*  it doesn't necessarily has to go through the oocyte
*  or the sperm and involve the epigenome.
*  You change the metabolism of the animal as it develops
*  and obviously it will affect it.
*  When you, for example, starve women that are pregnant,
*  as happened during this famous starvation studies,
*  the baby is already in utero,
*  exposed directly to the environment.
*  So it's not even a heritable effect.
*  The baby is itself affected.
*  It's a direct effect.
*  Very interesting, important and has many implications
*  and it will be separate from the genetics.
*  You'll have to take it into account
*  to understand what's going on.
*  It doesn't require necessarily new biology
*  and new biology of inheritance.
*  Not only is the embryo affected,
*  the embryo while in utero already has germ cells.
*  So it's also the next generation,
*  so it's directly exposed
*  and you don't need any new biology necessarily to explain it
*  and it doesn't have, has to involve epigenetics
*  or epigenetics.
*  It's clear to me that in the female fetus,
*  the total number of eggs that she will someday produce
*  and potentially have fertilized by sperm exist,
*  but in males with a 60 day sperm cycle,
*  leaves me the question, do fetal males,
*  males as fetuses, living as fetuses in their moms,
*  already start producing sperm
*  or it's the primordial cells that give rise to sperm?
*  So I'm not an expert,
*  so I don't want to go into the details
*  of exactly when in mammals,
*  but yes, exposure of the mother also affect
*  eventually the transmission of genetic information
*  for the sperm's father.
*  And there are also many examples
*  of just stressing the father's,
*  affecting the sperm and affecting the next generation.
*  There, if you go to the F2 generation,
*  if you go two generations down the road,
*  not to the kids, but to the grandkids,
*  then it is a real epigenetic effect
*  because you examine something that happens,
*  although the next generation was never exposed
*  to the original challenge.
*  So when we say about epigenetic inheritance
*  in through the paternal lineage, through the funders,
*  we talk about two generations,
*  and when you go through the mother, it's three generations
*  to talk about when you need to invoke
*  some real epigenetic mechanism.
*  And there, the evidence becomes much more scarce in mammals.
*  There are examples, more or less convincing,
*  the field is evolving and improving a lot.
*  So for example, now, many people use,
*  the cutting edge is to use IVF in vitro fertilization
*  or transfer of embryos to make sure
*  that you actually, it's the heritable information
*  and not the environment,
*  and that it goes through the germline.
*  So this is something that is being done now.
*  There are studies.
*  You're talking about the three-parent IVF
*  where they take the DNA from mom, the sperm from dad,
*  and they take the DNA from mom
*  and put it into a novel cytoplasm, or?
*  No, not at all, you just take the sperm
*  and transfer it and fertilize it, the egg.
*  So standard IVF.
*  Yes, standard IVF, yeah.
*  You can do it in many different ways,
*  but this idea that you separate the environment
*  of the mother from the inheritance
*  or the environment of the father,
*  to control and separate nature from nature.
*  The environment becomes the culture dish.
*  Yes.
*  So the field is improving.
*  People do experiments that have a higher end,
*  so more replicates and better controlled,
*  and there are some examples for effects that transfer,
*  and it depends who you ask whether people believe it or not.
*  Many geneticists do not believe it,
*  and many people do believe it,
*  and it depends on the community.
*  There are strong resistance for many reasons.
*  Some of them are justified, some less justified,
*  and are part of the scientific process
*  and how things work, because it's challenging the dogma.
*  So this is very interesting on its own.
*  If you ask psychologists, many psychologists believe
*  that there's heritable trauma and things like that.
*  Population geneticists, less so.
*  So this really depends, and I think that
*  we are just at a point in time where we don't really know
*  whether it happens and to what extent,
*  and we need bigger studies.
*  Even if you think about normal, just genetic studies,
*  where people try to understand the genetic underpinning
*  of complex traits, like anything
*  that involves the brain pretty much,
*  we now know that you need to study many, many, many people.
*  So now these big genome-wide association studies,
*  big genetic studies involve hundreds of thousands of people.
*  No one did an experiment like this for epigenetics.
*  It's much more complicated because you need to also
*  take into account the environment.
*  I'm not even sure we know how to design such an experiment.
*  It's very, very challenging.
*  So part of the resistance to the ideal
*  is based on theoretical grounds because of these barriers
*  and because of the controversies.
*  On the other hand, people really want to believe it.
*  People really want to believe it
*  because it sort of gives your life meaning.
*  If you can change your biology
*  of your kids through changing your biology.
*  Psychologically, I can understand
*  why many people want this to happen.
*  Even Schrodinger, the famous physicist,
*  so he wrote a very important book in 44,
*  so this was before the double helix.
*  It's called What is Life?
*  This is actually a book that drove many physicists
*  to establish molecular biology.
*  It's very, very important.
*  And he talked about the heritable material.
*  He also talks about evolution and he said,
*  unfortunately, Lamarckism, or inheritance of a quadrat,
*  is untenable, it doesn't happen.
*  And he writes, this is very, very sad or unfortunate
*  because unlike Darwinism or natural selection,
*  which is gloomy, doesn't matter what you do,
*  the next generation will be born based on the instruction
*  in the sperm and the egg.
*  You can't influence it.
*  Of course, you can give your kids money and education,
*  but you can't biologically influence it.
*  You can also, one thing I'm fascinated by
*  for a number of reasons is partner selection.
*  I mean, in some ways, we think,
*  oh, we want to find someone who is kind.
*  That does seem to be, by the way, the primary feature,
*  at least in the data tell us.
*  We had David Buss on the podcast of how women select men,
*  that people are kind.
*  There's also resource potential.
*  There's also beauty or aesthetic attractiveness
*  in males and females, et cetera.
*  Male, male, female, female, as the case may be,
*  but in terms of reproduction, sperm, egg,
*  male, female, obviously.
*  So we're selecting for a number of traits,
*  but presumably subconsciously,
*  we are also selecting for a number of traits
*  related to vigor and the idea that if we were to have
*  an offspring with somebody
*  that those traits would be selected for.
*  Right, and we actually have worked on that in nematodes
*  that I'll be happy to tell you about in a second
*  after we-
*  The dating in-
*  The dating in worms.
*  Fantastic.
*  And where we understand the mechanism,
*  and we'll go into that in a second,
*  or in a few minutes after we dive into the worms.
*  But yes, the original calculation
*  of how population genetics work,
*  to simplify things and to do the math,
*  it was random mating.
*  Of course it doesn't work like that.
*  So it's complicated things because we know.
*  And there's research about potential capacity
*  to somehow sense immune compatibility
*  and things like this, which is, I don't know,
*  I'm not an expert on that, but-
*  Neither am I, but my understanding is that, of course,
*  we're familiar with the other traits we select for,
*  like potential nurturing ability,
*  whether or not someone is reliable,
*  predicts something about their nurturing ability
*  for offspring potentially.
*  I mean, you can draw lines between these things
*  without any direct evidence,
*  but they seem so logical, right?
*  That somebody kind might also stick around or be honest
*  in these kinds of things that it makes sense.
*  But that one would be selecting
*  for certain biological traits like immune function,
*  or some other form of robustness that we're not aware of
*  is, I think, a fascinating area of biology.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, so this is where the work in mammals stands.
*  However, there's also one additional thing to mention,
*  which is that on top of chemical modifications
*  to the DNA and the proteins that condense the DNA,
*  which are called histones,
*  there are also other mechanisms
*  that might transmit information,
*  including transmission between generations of RNA.
*  And there are different types of RNA,
*  not just the RNA that we mentioned before,
*  the messenger RNA, which encodes the information
*  for making proteins, but also other RNAs
*  that regulate gene expression.
*  And this is, and I think that in recent years,
*  also in the mammalian field,
*  RNA as the molecule that has the potential
*  to transmit information between generation
*  took center stage.
*  So I think this is the cutting edge.
*  A lot more to understand than no,
*  but RNA has a lot of potential for doing that,
*  as we'll explain soon, but we have to go to worms first.
*  I'd like to just take a brief moment
*  and thank one of our podcast sponsors,
*  which is InsideTracker.
*  InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
*  that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
*  to help you better understand your body
*  and help you reach your health goals.
*  I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
*  for the simple reason that blood work is the only way
*  that you can monitor the markers, such as hormone markers,
*  lipids, metabolic factors, et cetera,
*  the impact your immediate and long-term health.
*  One major challenge with blood work, however,
*  is that most of the time,
*  it does not come back with any information about what to do
*  in order to move the values for hormones, metabolic factors,
*  lipids, et cetera, into the ranges that you want.
*  With InsideTracker,
*  changing those values becomes very straightforward
*  because it has a personalized dashboard that you can use
*  to address the nutrition-based, behavior-based,
*  supplement-based approaches that you can use
*  in order to move those values into the ranges
*  that are optimal for you, your vitality,
*  and your longevity.
*  InsideTracker now includes a measurement
*  of apolipoprotein B, so-called APO-B,
*  in their ultimate plan.
*  APO-B is a key marker of cardiovascular health,
*  and therefore, there's extreme value
*  to knowing your APO-B levels.
*  If you'd like to try InsideTracker,
*  you can go to insidetracker.com slash huberman
*  to get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans.
*  Again, that's insidetracker.com slash huberman
*  to get 20% off.
*  Thank you for that incredible overview of genetics
*  and RNA and epigenetics,
*  and it was essentially a survey of this very interesting,
*  and on the face of it, a complex field,
*  but you've simplified it a great deal for us.
*  In our transition to talking about worms,
*  I would like to plant a flag in the Huberman Lab podcast
*  and say that what we are about to discuss
*  is the first time that anyone on this podcast
*  has discussed so-called model organisms.
*  I may have mentioned a fly paper here or there,
*  or a study on honeybees and caffeine
*  and flower preference at one point,
*  but typically that's done in passing
*  and we quickly rotate to humans.
*  I know that many, if not most of our listeners
*  are focused on humans and human biology and health, et cetera,
*  but I cannot emphasize enough
*  the importance of model organisms
*  and the incredible degree to which they've informed us
*  about human health,
*  especially when it comes to very basic functions in cells.
*  I mean, one could argue, okay,
*  and there's been some debate telomeres in mice
*  that really lead to the same sort of data in humans.
*  Okay, there are those cases, certainly,
*  but model organisms are absolutely critical
*  and have been and basically inform most
*  of what we understand about human health.
*  So before we start to go into the description
*  about worms per se,
*  could you just explain to a general audience
*  what a model organism is, right?
*  They're not modeling,
*  they're not posing for photographs, obviously,
*  what that means and what some of the general model organisms
*  are and why you've selected or elected
*  to work on a particular type of worm
*  to study these fascinating topics
*  that there's zero question also take place
*  in humans at some level.
*  So it's a real pleasure and an honor
*  to represent the model organisms here.
*  I'm really happy just for that, it was worth it,
*  because as you said, model organisms are extremely important
*  and we learned so much about biology through them.
*  The model organisms mean that it's an organism
*  that many people work on,
*  so there's a community of people that work on.
*  People study many types of organisms,
*  but not around every organism.
*  There's a huge community of researchers
*  that combine forces to create all the resources
*  and the tools and the understanding that accumulate.
*  There are just a handful of model organisms
*  in the short history of the field of biology,
*  it's not so long.
*  We learned about every aspect of biology through them,
*  including many important diseases, human diseases.
*  And these are E. coli bacteria,
*  phage, which is a virus of bacteria,
*  and flies, worms that are called C. elegans nematodes,
*  this is what we study in the lab,
*  fish which are called zebrafish.
*  It's a particular-
*  It's danio danio or something.
*  Right.
*  And of course there are also model organisms,
*  other, and mouse.
*  And also plants, important plants,
*  the most studies one is the Arabidopsis.
*  And perhaps less so nowadays, but non-human primates,
*  macaque monkeys, marmoset, squirrel monkeys mainly.
*  These, I don't know exactly how the definition is,
*  but emerging model organisms.
*  There are many model organisms that are emerging
*  in the communities that are formed,
*  including also around the planaria that we mentioned before,
*  this flatworm that regenerates,
*  it's a great model for studying regenerations.
*  If we could develop new heads, it would be incredible.
*  And we can learn from these organisms.
*  And the reason that we can learn a lot also about humans
*  by studying these animals is that we all evolved
*  from the same ancestor.
*  So we shared a lot of our functions with them,
*  and also a lot of our genes.
*  C. elegans, and they have the different,
*  model organisms have different advantages that serve us.
*  They sometimes have some things
*  that are much more apparent in them that we can study.
*  For example, learning and memory was largely studied
*  in the beginning in a snail, a plesia,
*  where many of the discoveries were made
*  because it has big neurons that you can easily study
*  and examine.
*  And yes, snails learn.
*  Yes, they learn.
*  Even C. elegans, these nematodes that we study learn,
*  and they are much simpler than others.
*  Another important reason to study them, of course,
*  is you can actually experiment on them.
*  We can't do this to humans,
*  the things that we do to these animals.
*  And we can change their genes,
*  do all kinds of things for them.
*  And in some, sorry to interrupt, but in some cases,
*  I think you're going to tell us, for instance,
*  in C. elegans in particular,
*  the presence of particular cell types is so stereotyped
*  that you can look at several different worms
*  and you can, the community of people that study C. elegans
*  is literally numbered and named each neuron
*  so that two laboratories on opposite sides of the world
*  can publish papers on the same neuron,
*  knowing that it's the same neuron
*  in the two different laboratories,
*  something that is extremely hard to do
*  in any mammalian model, a mouse or certainly in humans.
*  And has posed huge challenges that give great advantages
*  to studies of things like C. elegans.
*  Yeah, so C. elegans, this is the star now
*  of what, and this is what we study.
*  These are nematodes, small worms, round worms,
*  that are just one millimeter long.
*  So you can't see them with the naked eye,
*  you have to look under the scope.
*  Where do they live in the natural world?
*  So they used to call them soil nematodes,
*  but they're not so common anymore.
*  They used to call them soil nematodes,
*  but this is not really true.
*  They are in many places,
*  but they're mostly in rotten fruits and leaves.
*  You can find them in the ground as well,
*  but you can also find them, and they are free living,
*  so they're not parasites,
*  but you can sometimes also find them in snails.
*  But the best way to isolate them is from rotten fruits.
*  Okay, I like the idea that they're not parasites.
*  I'm one of these people that gets a little squeamish
*  about the notion of parasites.
*  Yeah, so they're not parasites,
*  they're really fun to handle
*  because they're so small and easy.
*  You just roll them on plates with eggar and E. coli bacteria.
*  This is what they eat in the lab.
*  You can just pick them with a small pick,
*  wire pick, move them around,
*  and change their genes and do many things to them.
*  But they have many advantages for neuroscience
*  and for studying inheritance.
*  As you mentioned, they have always
*  a certain number of cells in the body.
*  So a C. elegans nematode always has 959 cells in its body.
*  That's it, okay?
*  Not 960, not 958.
*  959, okay?
*  And out of which 302 are neurons.
*  Always 302.
*  There's a huge debate now over Twitter
*  on whether it's 302 or 300.
*  I mean, I don't want to get into trouble, okay?
*  But people take this very, very hard.
*  I think it's 302, but let's not get into it
*  because I'll get into trouble.
*  Well, we can equilibrate all things here by,
*  you say 302, granted you're far more informed
*  in this model organism than I am or ever will be.
*  I'll say 300, and then we're balanced
*  in terms of partisan politics in the C. elegans community.
*  Perfect.
*  And it's always the same, and each neuron has a name.
*  Like you said, not only does every neuron has a name,
*  many of them, we know what they do.
*  So there's a few cells that are sensory neurons
*  that sense particular chemicals.
*  In certain situations, we know that a chemical
*  will be sensed just by one neuron.
*  There are the motor neurons and interneurons and all of that.
*  We know how many dopamine neurons there are
*  and serotonin neurons, and we know them all by their name.
*  Not only that, we know how they are connected
*  to one another.
*  We have a map, a connectome since the 80s,
*  like a subway map that tells us which neuron talks
*  with which other neurons, and it is the same, okay?
*  It was used to think, people thought that it was
*  exactly the same between genetically identical worms.
*  Now we know that there are slight differences,
*  but by and large, it is the same, and we have a roadmap
*  that we can use to study.
*  The so-called connectome.
*  The connectome.
*  Not only that, the worms are transparent,
*  so we can actually see the neurons fire
*  using particular tools.
*  And we can activate genes and silent genes
*  using optogenetics, like was discussed here on the podcast.
*  We can make the worms go forward or backward
*  or lay an egg by shining different waves of light on them.
*  And so we have very powerful tools
*  for manipulating the brain.
*  On top of that, we have great understanding
*  of the genetics of the worm, of the genome.
*  This is, coelagans is the first animal
*  to have its genome sequenced before humans.
*  Before that, of course, there were bacteria.
*  And we know that in each worm produces,
*  each mother produces about 250 babies,
*  which are almost genetically identical.
*  So we can, and we know where we grow them.
*  The environment is very controlled,
*  so we grow them in the plate with just bacteria.
*  So we can easily separate between nature and nurture.
*  And one thing that I wonder about often is generation time.
*  Even though mice are not humans,
*  mice have certain advantages
*  because they're mammalian species.
*  You can't do all the magnificent things
*  that you can do in coelagans in mice.
*  But one major issue with mice
*  is that the generation time is somewhat long.
*  Even pair two mice, they mate,
*  you get a mouse or litter of mice 21 days later.
*  It might seem like, okay, that's only 21 days or so.
*  But if you are a graduate student or a postdoc
*  trying to do a project,
*  I mean, that can extend the time to do experiments
*  out three or four years
*  compared to what you could do in coelagans.
*  You're absolutely right.
*  This is one of the major advantages.
*  The generation time in coelagans is three days, three days.
*  So you can do hundreds of worm generations in one PhD.
*  This is very important.
*  Not only that, every worm will produce hundreds of progeny
*  so you will have, that are genetically identical,
*  so you will have great statistics for your experiment.
*  And the worms probably don't mind living on these agar plates,
*  munching away on E. coli, where-
*  It's the good life.
*  It's questionable whether or not mice or certainly,
*  listen, I'm a proponent of well-controlled,
*  and as long as there's oversight animal research,
*  it's necessary for the development of treatments
*  of diseases that hinder humans.
*  But it is always a little bit of a kind of a cringe
*  and go kind of thing when you're dealing with mammals
*  that are living so far outside their natural environment.
*  I'd be lying if I didn't say that it gets to you
*  after a while, and if it doesn't get to you,
*  you kind of have to wonder about your own psyche a bit.
*  Right, I also think that this is important,
*  but for me, it's much easier to work on worms.
*  I don't have to, you know, feel bad about it.
*  Yeah, they're happy.
*  They're happy, and you also, I mean, if a worm dies,
*  it's less painful to the human
*  than if other more sensitive animals.
*  Yeah, I would argue yes, I agree, yeah.
*  So yes, so there are many advantages for studying C. elegans.
*  And in the worm, we now have very obvious
*  and clear cut proof that there is inheritance
*  of acquired traits, so much so that I don't think
*  that anyone pretty much in the epigenetic field
*  argues against it.
*  Well, and in large part, thanks to you
*  and the work you've done.
*  So could you tell us what was the first experiment
*  that you did on C. elegans that confirmed for you
*  that there is inheritance of acquired traits?
*  Because of course, the best experiments and experimenters
*  always set out to disprove their hypothesis.
*  And when the hypothesis survives,
*  despite all the control experiments and poking and prodding
*  and attempts to contradict oneself,
*  then it's considered a victory.
*  But it's one that we all have to be very cautious
*  about enjoying because of the tendency
*  to want our hypotheses to be true.
*  So what was the first experiment where you were convinced
*  that inheritance of acquired traits is real?
*  The first experiment I did was when I, in my postdoc,
*  which I did with Oliver Hobart in University of Columbia,
*  and we set to test whether worms can produce
*  transgenerational for long, multiple generations
*  resistance to viruses.
*  Wow, this is a very pertinent topic.
*  Which is a relevant thing.
*  And worms, these worms don't have dedicated immune cells
*  like we do, they don't have T cells or B cells.
*  They defend themselves from viruses
*  very efficiently using RNA.
*  So in fact, when we started these experiments,
*  there wasn't any natural virus that was known
*  to infect C. elegans, which is amazing.
*  Because viruses are very good,
*  as we all experience now in infecting.
*  And the worms are resistant to viruses
*  because of RNA molecules, short RNA molecules
*  that destroy viruses.
*  And these are called small RNAs.
*  Now we need to discuss them before I explain my experiment.
*  In 2006, two researchers that were studying C. elegans,
*  Andrew Feier and Craig Mellow got the Nobel Prize
*  for showing that there is a mechanism that regulate genes
*  that happens for small RNAs.
*  What they've shown is that if you inject the worms
*  with RNA molecules, which are double-stranded,
*  they lead to the site to, they shut off the genes
*  that correspond, that match in sequence to this RNA.
*  So sort of like taking the specific instructions
*  for the coffee table from your IKEA handbook
*  and you insert a copy of that into the book.
*  And in doing so, you prevent the expression of,
*  sort of erase the original page.
*  Perfect explanation, perfect explanation.
*  And they found that double-stranded RNA,
*  RNA that has two strands, is what starts the response,
*  leading to the production of small RNA molecules,
*  which are the ones that actually find the messenger RNA
*  and leads to its destruction,
*  silence it so you don't get proteins in the end.
*  For that they got the Nobel Prize
*  after people found that this is conserved
*  in many organisms, including humans.
*  And now there are now drugs,
*  this was only in 2006, the Nobel Prize,
*  paper was published in 98.
*  There are now drugs that use this mechanism
*  also in humans.
*  And I'll just interject and say that not only
*  is it a recent discovery and an incredibly important one,
*  but Andy Feier and Craig Mellow
*  are also really nice people.
*  Yeah.
*  They just happen to be very nice people.
*  And Craig Mellow is an excellent,
*  I think he's a kite surfer.
*  When I, the only time I met him in person
*  was at a meeting and he had a black eye.
*  And I thought, okay, wow,
*  I guess he's also a pugilist or something,
*  but turns out he had done that kite surfing.
*  So scientists actually do things other than
*  go to the laboratory, Nobel Prize winning scientists,
*  that is.
*  Okay, I'll let you continue.
*  Thanks for allowing me that introduction.
*  Yeah, incredible scientists.
*  And there were also studies in many organisms
*  on the mechanisms of how this happens.
*  It is called RNA interference.
*  RNA interferes in the expression of a gene
*  in the function of a gene.
*  And it's also called gene silencing
*  because these RNAs enforce the silencing of genes.
*  Instead of the genes being expressed,
*  they are silenced and you don't manage that function.
*  Already in the first paper that they published about this,
*  where they've shown the double-strand RNA
*  is what leads to the silencing of the control,
*  they've shown two very important things.
*  One of them is that if you inject the worms
*  with double-strand RNA,
*  you don't only see the action in the cell that you injected
*  or in the tissue that you injected,
*  but you see it all over the worm's body.
*  It spreads.
*  It wasn't exactly clear what spreads,
*  but it was clear that it spreads.
*  You see the silencing all over the body.
*  This includes also the germ cells.
*  So if you inject the double-strand RNA
*  just to somatic cells, even to the head,
*  you will get also the effect in the germ cells
*  and in the next generation, okay?
*  In the immediate progeny, the F1 generation, the kids.
*  So this was really clear proof that this is inherited.
*  However, this is just one generation, okay?
*  In these original studies.
*  Later, they've shown something
*  which will immediately remind you
*  what I told you about with planaria,
*  that you can just take worms and feed them on bacteria
*  that produce this double-strand RNA,
*  and that the double-strand and the silencing
*  would move from the site of ingestion from the gut
*  where the bacteria are eaten, to the rest of the body,
*  and also to the next generation, okay?
*  So before we left, when I mentioned
*  this cannibalistic experiments of McConnell
*  with the planaria, and now you see that it can happen,
*  and this is not controversial at all,
*  this is being done routinely every day
*  by any C. elegans biologist in the world.
*  So this has been replicated a million times.
*  Not only that, you can also feed planaria,
*  these other worms, with RNA.
*  You can just put it in chopped liver and let them eat it,
*  and again, this will signage throughout the body, okay?
*  Wild.
*  Okay, and this is what we do routinely.
*  We always, when we want, we use this technique
*  to see what genes do.
*  If we want to see whether a particular gene is important
*  for a certain behavior or a certain something,
*  the way to study is to neutralize the gene activity,
*  and we do it by just introducing the worms
*  with double-strand RNA that correspond in sequence,
*  that match in sequence this gene.
*  This will lead to the silencing,
*  this activate the gene's activity,
*  and if then the effect stops,
*  we know this gene is involved in the function.
*  And we never want to just examine one worm.
*  So we feed the mother with double-strand RNA,
*  and then we examine all of its children,
*  so we can have the statistics over hundreds of worms
*  or thousands of worms.
*  So this is validated and not controversial at all
*  and totally routine.
*  Is it fair to say that McConnell's experiments
*  of chop, blending up these worms, very graphic image,
*  blending up these worms,
*  and then feeding them to other worms, planaria,
*  that those experiments can, yes, be explained
*  by double-stranded RNA and through RNA interference?
*  Potentially, it hasn't been done yet.
*  We are working on it in my lab now
*  in collaboration with other labs,
*  but it wasn't published.
*  But yes, this could be the explanation.
*  So Fyre and Mello did these experiments.
*  Some other people did these experiments.
*  When I started my work, I wanted to see whether,
*  in addition to artificial double-strand RNA,
*  some natural traits can also transmit across generations
*  because of RNA, because of small RNAs.
*  Right, because injecting RNAi,
*  or short-interfering RNAs, that is,
*  or putting worms into an environment
*  with an abundance of inhibitory RNAs as an experiment
*  is very different than worms experiencing something
*  and then passing on that acquired trait to their offspring.
*  It's a world apart, in my opinion,
*  because one is an extreme manipulation
*  that illustrates an underlying principle.
*  The other is something that, in theory,
*  occurs in the passage of generations just naturally.
*  We're going from the less artificial
*  to the more artificial.
*  The advantages, just like with model organisms,
*  that the more artificial it is,
*  the easier it is to, you know exactly what you did.
*  Just now, introduce one factor,
*  and you can follow the result.
*  So this is always the trait.
*  What I did was, in Oliver's lab,
*  is to see whether the magic, part of the magic
*  for the worms' resistance to viruses
*  is their capacity to transmit information
*  in the form of RNA molecules,
*  inhibitory RNA molecules, to the next generations.
*  And it has been shown before in C. elegans
*  that the worms resist viruses using this mechanism,
*  these smaller RNAs.
*  In fact, this is probably the reason
*  that these smaller RNAs evolved in the first place,
*  to get rid of viruses and other parasitic genomic elements.
*  And this is a mechanism to fight them.
*  And what I did is a very simple experiment.
*  I took worms and I infected them with a virus.
*  When you do this, this also has been shown in the past,
*  the worms destroy the virus.
*  We demonstrated this very clearly using a fluorescent virus.
*  So if the virus replicates successfully,
*  the worms just turns green.
*  And if the virus is destroyed, the worm stays black.
*  This is very simple, it's a clear cutoff.
*  It's not, you don't examine the worm
*  and ask whether it feels good.
*  You just see this green light.
*  Binary response.
*  Yes. Yeah.
*  And so we took worms.
*  We infected them with the fluorescent virus.
*  They destroyed.
*  This also has been done in the past.
*  But then what we did is we neutralized the machinery
*  that makes smaller RNAs in the descendants of the worms.
*  So they cannot make smaller RNAs
*  from the start on their own,
*  because they just don't have the genes
*  that you need to make these smaller RNAs.
*  And then we ask, what will happen
*  when we'll infect these worms with a virus?
*  Will they be green or black?
*  They can't make their own smaller RNAs.
*  So they can't protect themselves on their own.
*  The only way for them to stay black,
*  for them not having the virus replicate,
*  is if they inherit the smaller RNAs from their parents.
*  And this is exactly what happens.
*  All the worms progeny, although they don't have the gene
*  that is needed for making the smaller RNAs, are black.
*  They silence the virus.
*  And this also continues for additional generations.
*  So the parent worms effectively put something
*  into the genetic instructions of the offspring
*  that would afford them,
*  let's call it an advantage in this case,
*  but afford them an advantage if they were to be confronted
*  with the same thing that the parents were.
*  And we know exactly what this advantage is.
*  The advantage is our small RNAs that match the viral genome
*  and just chop up the virus in the next generation.
*  And we can identify these smaller RNAs
*  in the inhibitory RNAs, in the descendants,
*  although they don't have the machinery to make it,
*  just because they inherit it.
*  We can identify them by sequencing.
*  By RNA sequencing, which is like DNA sequencing,
*  you actually get the actual sequence of the RNA molecules.
*  And we can see that they correspond to the virus.
*  And they inherit these smaller RNAs
*  only if their parents were infected with them.
*  So there's specificity there.
*  There's specificity.
*  Yeah, it's not some just general resilience passage.
*  I have to be careful in drawing an analogy
*  that isn't correct.
*  And I want to acknowledge that what I'm about to say
*  with certainty cannot be entirely correct.
*  But the analogy that comes to mind in mammals
*  is this idea that if one generation is stressed,
*  that their offspring may, in some cases,
*  have a higher stress threshold, a resilience to stress.
*  I could imagine why that would be advantageous.
*  Your parents have a hard life, they have offspring.
*  They want their children to have a higher threshold
*  to stress because stress can inhibit reproduction, etc.
*  As I always say, at the end of the day
*  and at the end of life, evolution is about the offspring,
*  not about the parents.
*  And every species pretty much seems to want to make more
*  of itself and protect its young one way or another,
*  either through nature or through nurture.
*  This is a nature-based protection of young.
*  Is it fair to say that in the mammalian experiment
*  with a passage of stress resilience,
*  that it could be RNA-based,
*  that that would be perhaps set some new threshold
*  on glucocorticoid production.
*  Here I'm speculating,
*  but I want to highlight that I'm speculating.
*  I'm speculating with a reason,
*  which is I think for people that are hearing about this
*  in worms, you've done a beautiful job of displaying out
*  why model organisms are really important.
*  But to think about how this may operate
*  in the passage of human generations,
*  I think is a reasonable thing to entertain.
*  Right, and it is true that also in mammals,
*  now RNAs and small RNAs are a lending candidate
*  for something that could mediate the transmission
*  of stress protection or also harmful effects
*  that transmit between generations.
*  Perhaps RNA do it.
*  However, in worms, the RNAs have one more trick
*  that we don't know the equivalent in mammals yet.
*  This is something very crucial that we showed
*  in that particular paper in the first paper.
*  Which is?
*  So the effect that I described,
*  this transmission of resistance to viruses
*  through these RNAs doesn't only affect the next generation,
*  it also affects multiple additional generations.
*  So it gets passed.
*  It gets passed and you have to ask yourself,
*  how doesn't it get dilutes?
*  Why isn't it diluted, right?
*  Because I mean, everyone produces 250 babies.
*  So you dilute by 250.
*  And if something is diluted for four generations,
*  so it's 250 times 250.
*  After four generations, it's a dilution of four billions.
*  Completely homeopathic would never work.
*  It's just there's nothing left.
*  The secret of these worms is that they have a machinery
*  for amplifying the small RNAs in every generation.
*  This is called RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
*  It's a complex which uses the RNA to find
*  and once it finds the messenger RNA,
*  just create many, many, many, many smaller RNAs.
*  So they don't get diluted
*  and they pass on for additional generations.
*  And this is the trick.
*  We later also identify genes that regulate
*  for how long an effect would last.
*  Otherwise, if in the beginning we ask,
*  how doesn't it stop after one generation?
*  Now we have to ask why doesn't it last forever?
*  And it doesn't.
*  Typically we see that the responses last
*  not only with the viral resistance
*  but also with other traits for a few generations,
*  three to five generations.
*  We found genes that function as a sort of a clock
*  that times the duration of the inheritance.
*  What sorts of genes are those?
*  So we call these genes MOTEC genes.
*  MOTEC, I don't know how is your Hebrew,
*  but MOTEC, it means sweetheart in Hebrew.
*  But the acronym is modified transgenerational
*  epigenetic kinetics.
*  There are different types of genes like that.
*  And for some of them, if you mutate,
*  if you disrupt their function,
*  now the effect would transmit stably
*  for hundreds of generations.
*  It would never stop.
*  Because their role is to stop the inheritance
*  from just, you don't wanna carry over something forever,
*  otherwise it will no longer fit
*  the environment of the parents
*  and you'll be prepared for the wrong things.
*  So this is important.
*  There are, what type of genes are they?
*  One gene that we studied, it's called MET2.
*  It's actually a gene that functions in methylation
*  of the proteins that condense the DNA.
*  So this is, and there are,
*  but then there are other genes that affect also production
*  of small RNAs.
*  Is there some mechanism that controls the duration
*  of passage in a way that logically links up
*  with the lifespan of the organism?
*  So for instance, I knew my grandparents, met them.
*  I did not ever meet my great grandparents.
*  And I certainly didn't meet my great, great grandparents.
*  I could imagine that my great, great grandparents
*  or my great grandparents experience certain things
*  that were passed into their children
*  and perhaps into their children.
*  But it seems reasonable given that humans live somewhere
*  between zero and a hundred years, typically what now?
*  80 years, is that the typical lifespan?
*  More or less, okay?
*  That the, if I were gonna design the system,
*  and again, I was not consulted at the design phase,
*  I would want an adaptive trait to be passed
*  for two generations because given the way that our,
*  given how long our species lives
*  and certainly given the way the world looks now,
*  as opposed to the turn of the previous century
*  or the turn of the previous century, different stressors,
*  different adapt, you know, different life environments.
*  And what I would want to pass on to my offspring,
*  I can basically hedge pretty well.
*  I can place a good bet on the next hundred years,
*  maybe the next 200, but I don't have the foggiest clue
*  what the world is gonna look like in 300 years.
*  Does what I'm saying make any sense whatsoever?
*  It makes a lot of sense.
*  And really, we need to talk about two things
*  in response to this question.
*  First of all, yes, you can imagine that the reason
*  that the worms inherit typically for three to five generations
*  is that this is relevant to something
*  that happened in the environment.
*  For example, we also show that when you starve the worms,
*  it affects the next generations,
*  again, for a few generations.
*  Which itself is amazing.
*  I just like wanna highlight that.
*  I mean, you can imagine next generation,
*  it's sort of like a genetic version of be careful kids,
*  but I'm gonna give you this extra lunch pack
*  in your genome that protects you
*  against the possibility of starvation.
*  But it's also saying, and were you to have kids?
*  Right. They have it also.
*  Yeah, so I have to just make a disclaimer
*  that we don't know that necessarily it's adaptive.
*  It could also be damaged.
*  As I said, when you starve them,
*  the next generations live longer,
*  but this could be a trade off for fertility or something.
*  So other labs have also shown following our work
*  that if you starve the worms,
*  the next generations are also more resistant
*  to harsher starvation.
*  This sounds, this is not our work,
*  but this sounds adaptive.
*  But whenever you're talking about adaptation,
*  you have to see it in the context of evolution.
*  There's also this famous saying,
*  nothing in biology makes sense
*  except in the light of evolution.
*  And so it's very hard to say
*  without doing the lab evolution experiments,
*  we actually see who wins, the ones that inherit
*  or the ones that don't have, who takes over.
*  Otherwise, it's hard to talk about
*  whether it's adaptive or not.
*  But when it comes to the duration of the response,
*  yes, it could be programmed to fit something.
*  For example, if you're talking about starvation,
*  worms transition between periods of starvation
*  and periods where they have a lot of food.
*  So let's say they find an apple.
*  For a few generations, they will consume the apple
*  and then they will be starved for a while.
*  Perhaps this is the number of generations
*  that takes them to finish an apple.
*  Or perhaps there are other responses
*  also to higher temperatures.
*  If you grow worms in higher temperatures,
*  their offerings are different.
*  They change how they mate.
*  It's what I alluded to before.
*  We're gonna get back to this
*  because it relates to cold exposure,
*  which many listeners are interested in.
*  And perhaps it is somehow correlated
*  with the cycle of the year.
*  But to tell you the truth, I don't know.
*  As I said, we go from the more artificial
*  to the less artificial.
*  If double-strand RNA, just synthetic RNA,
*  is the most artificial, starvation is more natural,
*  but it's not starvation in the real context of the world,
*  in a real apple.
*  It's a plate with or without E. coli bacteria.
*  It's not an apple on a tree exposed to the elements
*  with other worms, with bacteria,
*  with all kinds of complications.
*  And it could be that we will see different durations
*  of heritable effects the more natural we go.
*  It's just much less controllable and hard to do.
*  And again, when we're talking about humans,
*  part of the argument why people, why the disbelievers,
*  it's not about faith.
*  The critics say that this wouldn't happen in humans
*  if they say, you know, the worms' generation time
*  is just three days.
*  The chances that the parent's environment will match
*  the children's environment is very high
*  because there's not a lot of time
*  for the environment to change it,
*  plus they can't go very far, they're small.
*  There are many examples of epigenetic inheritance
*  in plants.
*  This is a big field where there are very established proof
*  for inheritance of aqua traits, for epigenetic inheritance.
*  I'll be more careful.
*  Epigenetic inheritance of aqua traits is more loaded term,
*  but in plants it also happens.
*  And then you also say these are sessile organisms,
*  they can't run away, so the environment is more constant.
*  Well, ideas, maybe just a quick example
*  that I've heard before.
*  Tell me if I'm wrong.
*  I very well, maybe.
*  For instance, a particular species of plant
*  that grows a straight, maybe slightly bended stalk
*  might be exposed to some environment
*  where in order to capture enough sunlight
*  and other nutrients might need to grow in a corkscrew form.
*  The corkscrew form can be inherited
*  several generations from.
*  This is an example that I don't know, but perhaps it's-
*  Something like that.
*  I assume that someone will tell,
*  trust me, the one thing we know about podcasting
*  and YouTube is someone will tell us in the comments.
*  So, and please do, we invite that.
*  Right, but there's a long history
*  of epigenetic inheritance studies in plants
*  with excellent studies, well-controlled,
*  showing that it happens also there.
*  So this is very clear.
*  When it comes to humans, you could say,
*  maybe my kids will go off to live in a different continent
*  and they will be on the computer every day.
*  Everything will be different,
*  so it makes less sense to prepare them
*  for the same hardships that I experienced.
*  However, this, in my opinion, this argument comes a lot.
*  It's not the best argument because it depends on the scale
*  of how you look at things.
*  We experience, we meet, for example,
*  I'm not saying that this is inherited, but in humans,
*  but we experience the same pathogens
*  and the same viruses all the time.
*  So perhaps it is worth preparing for them.
*  Again, I'm not saying that it happens,
*  but it depends on the scale.
*  Well, what you're describing makes perfect sense,
*  and I do want to acknowledge these critics,
*  whoever they may be.
*  I do have the advantage that I don't work
*  in this exact field, and so I'm happy to stand
*  toe-to-toe with those critics now
*  and say that at least in terms of inheritance
*  of reactions or adaptive or maladaptive traits to stress
*  or to reward, you talked about nicotine before,
*  passage of response to drugs of different kinds,
*  not being specific to nicotine.
*  It was sort of a more general passage
*  of some sort of information related to reactions
*  to chemicals present in nicotine, but other drugs.
*  I have long been irritated and a little bit tickled
*  by the fact that people say,
*  oh, we have this system for stress
*  that was really designed to keep us safe from lions
*  and saber-toothed tigers.
*  Sure, but the hallmark of the stress system
*  is that it generalizes.
*  I mean, if I get a troubling text message
*  or if I suddenly see a dark figure in the hallway
*  when I go to the bathroom at night that I don't recognize,
*  both of those have the same generic response,
*  which is the deployment of adrenaline
*  in both brain and body, changes in the optics of the eyes,
*  quickening of the heart rate.
*  Stress is by design generic.
*  And so one could imagine that a passage
*  of some sort of stress resilience
*  or a maladaptive passage to stress
*  would be also somewhat generic,
*  and that's actually advantageous overall.
*  Same thing with the reward system.
*  We essentially have one or two chemical systems of reward.
*  I mean, there's the opioid system
*  and there's the cannabinoid system,
*  but in large part, anticipation and reward
*  is governed by the dopamine circuits.
*  And anticipation and reward of an ice cream cone for a kid
*  is the same neural circuitry that's going to be repurposed
*  when they get to reproductive age
*  and they are anticipating creating children with their mate
*  and assuming they want to do that,
*  the dopaminergic system is going to be engaged.
*  So ice cream, sex, stress to weather, stress to famine,
*  the biology of these more modal systems,
*  and especially in the nervous system are,
*  again, I have to be careful with the words by design,
*  are certainly generic.
*  And so I don't see the need for immense specificity.
*  I mean, it's not like we're, well, COVID just happened.
*  So could you imagine that there's the passage
*  of a COVID-19 specific resilience?
*  No, I think what would probably be passed along
*  would be some sort of, if it does occur,
*  would be some sort of resilience to viruses more generally,
*  and that would be advantageous.
*  Right, so I agree.
*  And this opens the question
*  of what is the bandwidth of inheritance?
*  How specific can it be that it makes sense
*  for it to be specific?
*  And in the case of C. elegans,
*  the response can be very specific
*  through this inheritance of RNAs,
*  which are just sequence specific.
*  They down-regulate, they control one particular gene.
*  In other cases, it could be a very general response.
*  And it's very interesting to think about it
*  when we talk about inheritance of memories,
*  which is the most interesting thing we could amend.
*  Can brain activity of some sort transmit,
*  at least in these worms?
*  I said, no, I said this disclaimer multiple times.
*  In memos, we don't know, times will tell.
*  In worms, we know a lot.
*  So can worms transmit brain activity?
*  Do they have the specificity to do it?
*  Before I'll say that, I'll just say that we,
*  over the years, learned a lot about the mechanisms
*  that shuttle the RNAs between generations.
*  We know about genes that are needed just for that.
*  About worms, it would be perfectly okay,
*  but just don't have the capacity to transfer the RNAs
*  to the next generations.
*  We know about genes that will make the responses longer
*  or shorter.
*  We know about genes that prevent the transfer of RNA
*  between different tissues.
*  About genes that make certain smaller RNAs.
*  So we know a lot about that.
*  And then the question arises, we can finally ask,
*  can memory transfer between generation?
*  I think that, first of all,
*  we need to define memory for this.
*  And the broadest definition would be any change
*  in your behavior because of what happened in the past
*  or in your response because what happened in the past
*  or because of your history.
*  The more interesting part, of course,
*  is to talk about memories that are encoded in the brain.
*  And the reason is that the brain is capable
*  of holding much more specific and elaborate memories.
*  Then I think that any tissues that transmit,
*  to transmit RNA to the next generation
*  and affect the next generation is interesting.
*  The guts, muscles, everything.
*  But the brain can synthesize information
*  about the environment and about internal states
*  and can also think ahead.
*  And the most provocative thing you can say
*  is that you could plan how, somehow,
*  the fate of your next generation using your brain
*  after taking many things into account.
*  Without talking to them.
*  Right, without talking.
*  And instruction, so it's, again,
*  we go back to this instruction manual.
*  It's like writing something into the instruction manual
*  based on your own experience.
*  Right, and can it happen?
*  And what is the bandwidth?
*  Can we transfer specific things?
*  And then I have to agree with you
*  that I would imagine that what can transfer,
*  and I could be wrong, is a general something, sensitivity.
*  You can make the analogy to being inflamed or not.
*  Hypersensitive to pathogens, hypervigil, something like this.
*  But it can also be something very specific.
*  Now we have to understand that the brain
*  uses a different language than the language of inheritance.
*  The brain, the way we normally think about the brain
*  is that it keeps information in synapses,
*  in the connection between different neurons.
*  When you learn something, you make some connections stronger
*  and other connections weaker.
*  And you wire the nervous system in a different way.
*  The information in the brain is synaptic,
*  and it is in the connections.
*  On the other hand, heritable information of any sort
*  has to go through a bottleneck of one cell,
*  the fertilized egg, because we all start from just one cell.
*  So it cannot be in the connections,
*  because this cell doesn't have any connections
*  with other cells, it's there alone.
*  So heritable information has to be molecular,
*  it has to be inside this one cell.
*  So the question is, can you or do you
*  translate the information, this 3D structure information
*  of synapses and the connection between brains
*  in the architecture of the brain?
*  Can you somehow translate it to heritable information
*  to a molecular form?
*  It's an incredibly important and deep question.
*  It brings to mind something that was once told to me,
*  which as soon as I heard it was obvious,
*  but was very important in formulating
*  my understanding of biology,
*  which is that a map is just the transformation
*  from one set of points into another set of points.
*  So a map of the world essentially is just,
*  you take what's been drawn out in terms of the architecture
*  and the coastlines, et cetera, and divisions between states,
*  and you transfer that to an electronic map
*  or a piece of paper.
*  It seems so obvious it's sort of a duh,
*  why are we talking about this?
*  But just to make sure that people understand
*  what you're really talking about is,
*  let's say the memory, and I have a very distinct memory
*  for my childhood phone number.
*  Phone number doesn't exist anymore.
*  And I won't give it out because then some other person
*  might get you with repeated calls.
*  But in any case, I remember it.
*  It's totally useless information,
*  but it lives in my neocortex or my hippocampus
*  or somewhere as a series of connections between neurons
*  at the locations as you call synapses.
*  Would my grandchildren know that phone number?
*  There's no reason for them.
*  Absolutely no.
*  No, right?
*  Would my children know that,
*  unless there was some adaptive reason
*  or some other reason for them to know
*  and this passage of acquired traits.
*  And what you're saying is, in order for that to happen,
*  there has to be a transformation of the neural circuit,
*  literally the wiring of neuron A, B, C, D,
*  that relates to and carries the information of that number
*  into the kind of nucleotide sequences
*  that are contained in DNA or patterns of methylation
*  or RNA more likely.
*  So it's the transformation of one set of points
*  in physical space to a translation of points
*  in genetic space.
*  Is that makes sense?
*  Right, and then we have many problems.
*  First of all, we don't know a mechanism to translate
*  between the two different languages,
*  the language of the brain and the language of inheritance.
*  We are not familiar with a mechanism like that.
*  Second, the next generation, if it's not a worm,
*  if it's a mammal, would have a different brain.
*  Even if it was genetically identical to the parrot,
*  the wiring of the brain
*  and the particular neuronal circuits will be different.
*  This is true for twins.
*  It will always be true because it depends,
*  because it's partly random and it depends on the environment,
*  even if you have the same genetic instructions.
*  So let's say you somehow had a mechanism,
*  miracle mechanism to take the 3D information
*  and translate it to the language of inheritance.
*  You would then in the next generation
*  have to translate it again to the brain,
*  although it is different.
*  This sounds very unlikely.
*  I'm playing a trick on you now, okay?
*  I believe it.
*  I'm easy to trick, so that's good.
*  But if this is how it happened, or if this was required,
*  it could never happen in my opinion,
*  which means, and I still think,
*  that there are certain memories
*  that cannot transfer transgeneration,
*  and these complex and things that you learn
*  about the environment that are arbitrary.
*  None of our listeners' kids will remember this conversation.
*  No way.
*  This is impossible.
*  Unless they're listening with them.
*  There are some families or parents
*  that tell me they're listening.
*  Right, right, but it cannot transmit
*  because it's random,
*  and these are connections that are arbitrary.
*  So this seems to be a limitation on what can transfer.
*  On the other hand, so perhaps more general things
*  could pass, these type of things, I doubt they could.
*  However, you can nevertheless imagine
*  that some things that are very specific,
*  some memories that are very, very specific,
*  could nevertheless transmit from the brain
*  after learning to the next generation.
*  I'll give you an example.
*  You can teach worms, even though they have just 302 neurons,
*  you can teach them simple things about the world.
*  For example, you can take an odor that the worms like.
*  The worms have thousands of odor interceptors,
*  and they can recognize many, many, many molecules.
*  They can smell them so they can find food or avoid enemies.
*  You can take a food that the worms like,
*  an odor that the worms like,
*  and pair it to something bad, like starvation,
*  and then the worms will learn to dislike this odor.
*  We don't know that this learning involves necessarily
*  changing in the strength of synapses.
*  It's a possibility, but it doesn't have to be the case.
*  It could be that just the receptor for this particular odor
*  is being removed.
*  And this is how they learn.
*  Now they won't have the receptor, they won't smell,
*  they won't like the odor.
*  This is a possibility.
*  This type of thing you can perhaps,
*  not that anyone has showed it convincingly,
*  transmit to the next generation,
*  because all it would take is an RNA
*  that will control this particular receptor.
*  So this is a possibility.
*  People have shown things like that not in C. elegans,
*  but people have shown things like this in mammals.
*  They said that you learn certain thing,
*  and then just in the next generation,
*  that's a particular receptor would be methylated
*  or would change, and this would transmit the response.
*  And on the one hand, it could be true.
*  On the other hand, you need to understand,
*  they'll need to prove, and this wasn't done
*  convincingly enough yet,
*  how exactly does the information transfer
*  from the brain to the germ cells,
*  and then in the next generation,
*  from the germ cells back to the brain
*  to where the receptor need to operate.
*  And this is a challenge.
*  This is the current state of the field,
*  that this is something that needs to be proven.
*  What we did in C. elegans is we showed
*  that certain, that the brain can communicate
*  with the next generations using small RNAs,
*  and that this can change behavior,
*  and it doesn't require any translating
*  between any language.
*  It is very simple.
*  What we've shown is that if you take a worm
*  and you change the production of small RNAs
*  just in its brain, in the next generations,
*  their behavior will be different,
*  even though you don't mess with their brains.
*  This is a paper that we published in 2019 in CEL.
*  We showed that you just manipulate
*  the production of endogenous natural RNAs
*  in the worm's brain that are always made,
*  but you change their amount,
*  and this changes the capacity of the worms
*  in the next generation to find food,
*  not only in one generation,
*  but three generations down the road.
*  And the way that it works is that
*  perturbing the production of these small RNAs
*  in the brain affects, in the end,
*  the expression of a gene in the germline.
*  One gene is called SAGE2.
*  Don't know how it works,
*  but we can do all kinds of controls
*  where we manipulate the activity of the gene
*  and see that this also affects behavior.
*  And this gene works in the germ cells.
*  The information needs to go from the brain
*  to the germ cells.
*  It doesn't need to go back from the germ cells
*  to the brain to affect behavior.
*  And this depends, we know that this is
*  a true epigenetic effect because
*  it goes on for multiple generations,
*  and also because it requires the machinery
*  that transfers RNAs between generations.
*  If you don't have the protein that physically
*  carries the RNA between generations,
*  it doesn't happen.
*  So it has to be RNA.
*  It has to be RNA.
*  And we can also find the RNAs
*  in the next generation that change.
*  We sequence the actual RNAs
*  that change in the next generation.
*  You mentioned that you don't know what SAGE,
*  this gene SAGE does,
*  but is it reasonable to assume that it does something
*  in the context of the nervous system,
*  or that's unclear as well?
*  It is possible.
*  It is possible, but we have reasons to believe,
*  or experiments to show, although there could be
*  alternative explanations, that it functions
*  through the germline.
*  Now you may ask, how can you affect behavior
*  just by changing the germ cells, right?
*  Well, it would have to change the germ cells
*  in very specific ways, because as people probably recall,
*  the germ cells are where the inheritable information
*  is contained, but you can imagine it, for instance,
*  adjusting the gain or sensitivity rather
*  on some sort of sensory foraging system, right?
*  Right.
*  And the interesting thing is,
*  it again can be quite unspecific.
*  So it sounds weird that you change germ cells
*  and it changes behavior, sperm in it,
*  but if you think about it, it's trivial.
*  If you castrate a dog, it behaves differently, right?
*  Sadly, yeah, I did that to my dog
*  and I ended up putting him on testosterone therapy later
*  and it brought him back.
*  Yeah.
*  Just as an aside.
*  Yes, this is because the germ cells affect the soma,
*  including the brain, in many ways,
*  by secreting certain chemicals,
*  and also because the other cells develop
*  from the germ cells, so some information could be
*  transmitted over development, or the course of development
*  could be altered because of changes
*  that occur in the germ cells.
*  And for example, in mammals, one of the explanations
*  for how heritable information transmits
*  is that it just affects something very own in development.
*  I told you that the secrets to worms inheritance
*  is that they have the capacity to amplify
*  these small RNAs all the time.
*  This is what keeps it going and prevents the dilution.
*  In mammals, we don't know of such an amplification mechanism,
*  so you ask, how can a little bit of RNA or something
*  without amplifying affect the entire organism?
*  And it could be that you just perturb something
*  in the very beginning, when you just have a few cells,
*  or even in the placenta that develops in pregnancy,
*  and this later throws everything off.
*  And because of that, you have many problems,
*  in metabolism and so on.
*  And this is called, it's an idea of the developmental origin
*  of health and disease.
*  Many of the functions occur early on in development.
*  So you've raised a number of incredibly
*  fascinating aspects to this.
*  I do have a question about one particular aspect,
*  and feel free to pass on this for a future episode
*  if it's going to take us too far off track.
*  But something you said really captured my attention,
*  although I was listening to all of it,
*  which is that the germ cells, so in the case of males,
*  it's going to be sperm, and in the case of females,
*  it can be eggs.
*  Something perhaps not coincidental about those cells
*  and the environment that they live in,
*  is that, yes, they contain the genetic information
*  and pass to offspring, right?
*  Of course you explain how that works.
*  But also it's a, those cells live in a region
*  that is rich with hormones that can be secreted,
*  and in fact are secreted,
*  and through so-called endocrine signaling,
*  communicate with other cells,
*  not just at the level of receptors on their surface,
*  but also can enter the genomes of those cells
*  and modify those cells.
*  In other words, it seems to me that the microenvironment
*  of the germ cells, the testes and the ovaries,
*  are rich with information,
*  not just for the passage to next generations,
*  but also for all the, as you said,
*  all the somatic cells of the body,
*  they're telling the somatic cells of the body
*  what to do and what to become.
*  And the best example I can think about this
*  would be puberty, right?
*  I mean, I would argue that one of the greatest rates
*  of aging and transitions we go through in life
*  is from puberty.
*  I mean, a child becomes a very different person
*  after puberty.
*  They look at the world differently.
*  They think about it differently.
*  The growth of, it's not just about the growth of the hair
*  and the jaw and the atoms, apple and breasts and so on.
*  It's a transformation of the somatic cells
*  from the same microenvironment
*  that the DNA-containing cells reside.
*  Right, so once you think about it like this,
*  it becomes obvious that just by affecting the germ cells,
*  you can affect the rest of the body.
*  And in C. elegans, they are experimented,
*  show it very clearly.
*  So for example, if you just take worms
*  and prevent sperm production,
*  it changes the capacity to smell.
*  These are experiments done by others,
*  which is obviously a brain function.
*  And in a castrated dog, you're not just eliminating
*  the possibility of transfer of DNA information
*  to subsequent generations.
*  You're also limiting communication of the, yeah.
*  Without question, my bulldog, Costello,
*  changed after castration and it was a wonderful dog,
*  but at some point developed some health issues.
*  The introduction of a small amount of testosterone
*  every other day changed him fundamentally,
*  in that case for the better,
*  back to a version of himself that I had only observed
*  earlier, but also a different version of the same dog.
*  And no, he wasn't humping everything,
*  maybe the occasional knee, particular people,
*  who I, his names I won't mention,
*  but it was absolutely clear that the hormone
*  was not just taking a system and amplifying it,
*  it was actually modifying the system.
*  So anyway, I just wanted to highlight that.
*  And then now, thank you for indulging me.
*  Let's, if you will, let's continue down this path
*  of that we were going on,
*  because I wanna make sure that we absolutely get
*  to this issue of transmission of information
*  about sex choice of offspring.
*  So the worms are hermaphrodites,
*  which means that they make both sperm and eggs,
*  but there are also males, which are much more rare,
*  and they can choose to mate with the males or not.
*  Okay.
*  And when they mate with the male, it's a huge decision,
*  because it's very costly energetically,
*  and they also risk predation and all kinds of troubles.
*  The males hurt them and reduce their life span
*  when they mate with them.
*  People are gonna draw all sorts of analogies here,
*  but it's inevitable, but hey, here we go.
*  Yes.
*  And most importantly for evolution,
*  when you mate with another animal,
*  you dilute your genome in half,
*  because the worms can just self-fertilize
*  and transmit the exact same genome to the next generation,
*  but when they mate, they dilute it in half.
*  So this is a big price to pay.
*  On the other hand, when you mate, you diversify your genome.
*  So maybe some combination of gene will be good.
*  And we know that in humans, I mean,
*  it's kind of interesting that the brain circuits
*  that are associated with aversion and with approach
*  are fairly hardwired for a number of things,
*  like puddle of vomit, almost everybody kind of cringes,
*  plate of cookies, if you like cookies, you move towards it.
*  But there's one particular word in the English
*  and particularly in the Israeli language
*  that ought to evoke disgust, and that's incest,
*  because incest is actually not just disgusting
*  as a practice, but it's dangerous genetically, right?
*  Because inbreeding creates a deleterious mutation.
*  Right, so there are studies of how people
*  in Israeli kibbutz, for example,
*  where they all grow together, the children live together,
*  it used to be like that, don't date each other,
*  but this is the classic thing.
*  I talked to someone from the kibbutz,
*  he told me that's not true, but yes,
*  that there are studies like this that say,
*  but it makes sense.
*  And in some countries, Scandinavian countries,
*  or in Lapland and Iceland, where populations are small,
*  they keep exquisite records of lineage
*  in order to avoid inbreeding.
*  Right, right, so you're absolutely right.
*  But the worms, the safe choice for them is to self mate,
*  and if they mate with a male,
*  they take a risk, but they diversify, okay?
*  What we found is that if you take the hermaphrodites,
*  we can call it the female for just one second,
*  and you stress it with high temperatures,
*  then the next generations of worms, for three generations,
*  mate much more with males, and they do it
*  because the female starts secreting a pheromone
*  that attracts the males.
*  Ah, that's a very cryptic mechanism.
*  It's not that she somehow changes
*  and then goes seeking males.
*  It's that it draws males in.
*  It draws males in, and we know how it works.
*  We think we know how it works.
*  What happens is that the stress, the high temperatures,
*  compromise the production of sperm in the hermaphrodites.
*  So the hermaphrodites don't,
*  they make sperm enough to make next generations,
*  but the sperm, because of defective small RNA inheritance,
*  because RNAs are not inherited, okay,
*  the sperm is not made optimally, so they make less sperm.
*  And when they don't make a lot of sperm,
*  they feel that they don't self-fertilize correctly,
*  so they call the males by secreting the pheromones
*  so that it would provide its own sperm
*  and they can continue to make babies.
*  And we know this also from experiments.
*  You just take hermaphrodites and you kill its sperm,
*  start secreting a pheromone, and the males come.
*  It's a need-based system.
*  Exactly, exactly.
*  Incredible.
*  And I hope people can appreciate as they're hearing this
*  that none of this, we assume,
*  I don't know how to speak worm,
*  none of this, we assume,
*  is a conscious decision in these animals,
*  much like human mating behavior,
*  which to us always seems so conscious,
*  but is being governed by both conscious
*  and subconscious decision-making.
*  None of this is an active decision to secrete the hormone
*  to draw in more males.
*  It's simply a biasing of probabilities, right?
*  The hormone is now secreted in greater quantities
*  or greater frequency.
*  The males, therefore, approach more,
*  so it's just increasing probability of interactions.
*  Is that right?
*  What happens naturally, normally,
*  if you don't stress the ancestors,
*  is that the worms start secreting the pheromone
*  only when they are old.
*  There's also, you know, people will...
*  When they're running out of their own fertility.
*  Exactly, because they only make the sperm
*  at a particular time,
*  and then they run out of their sperm.
*  They can self-certify, so they have to call the males
*  if they want to continue to mate.
*  Well, this is sort of the plastic surgery approach.
*  Okay, I'll take the heat for that one, but you know,
*  but it's true, I think as certain people age
*  to a certain point,
*  and they feel that their fertility is waning,
*  if they want offspring,
*  they need to take any number of different approaches.
*  They could get a...
*  Here we're talking about a female,
*  but we could also do the reverse, right?
*  If we do a sperm donor, right?
*  Or, but if they want to attract a lifelong mate
*  or co-parent with somebody,
*  oftentimes they will do things to adjust their attractiveness
*  in any number of different ways,
*  psychological attractiveness or physical attractiveness.
*  I'm not afraid to bring this up,
*  because I think that the parallels are very important,
*  because I do think that every species
*  and individuals within a species, of course,
*  decides whether or not they want to reproduce or not,
*  but has an inherent understanding,
*  conscious or subconscious,
*  about where they reside in the arc of their lifespan.
*  I do believe that, not just based on experience.
*  Some people are very attuned to the passage of time,
*  being very fast, others very slow.
*  I think that knowing how long your parents
*  and their parents lived makes a big difference.
*  I have friends whose fathers in particular
*  died fairly young,
*  and all these guys basically got married
*  and had kids really young.
*  Right, so here, luckily for me,
*  I don't have to get into psychology of the worms.
*  The explanation is just like an instinct.
*  When they run out of sperm,
*  they start to get the pheromones and attract the males.
*  There are studies also in humans about older fathers,
*  that children of older fathers have more,
*  has a higher chance of becoming autistic.
*  There are studies.
*  40 and up, basically.
*  However, in this case, it's not clear that this is not,
*  epigenetics could be just because of DNA damage,
*  because it accumulates.
*  And actually nowadays,
*  we have an episode on fertility coming up,
*  both male and female fertility.
*  And there are actually DNA fragmentation kits.
*  At home, DNA fragmentation kits are sperm analysis.
*  You send the sperm back in, you don't do the DNA.
*  People pipetting, semen at home would be an odd picture.
*  Let's not go there.
*  But there are clinics that do this for a nominal charge.
*  I did want to ask about autism,
*  and human disease in particular.
*  Another thing that you hear sometimes,
*  and here I want to acknowledge autism is on a spectrum.
*  Some people get upset if you call it a disorder.
*  There are some adaptive autistic traits and et cetera.
*  But one thing that often comes up is this idea
*  that two people who are more of the kind of engineering,
*  hard science, if you will, of phenotype,
*  mate and have children,
*  higher probability of the offspring being on the spectrum.
*  Some people would argue,
*  but that's already selecting for people
*  that might have already been partially on the spectrum.
*  So maybe it's a gene copy issue.
*  I'm not asking you to comment on autism in particular.
*  But when you hear things like that,
*  that the children of older fathers,
*  born from older fathers,
*  tend to have a higher probability of autism.
*  What is that, at the level of intuition,
*  does that strike you as an epigenetic phenomenon,
*  as a nature nurture mishmash,
*  or the possibility that it's RNA passage?
*  Or does anything trigger the whiskers, your spidey sense?
*  So in that case,
*  I would go with the most parsimonious explanation,
*  which is it just less fidelity or less DNA maintenance
*  and some damage that passes on.
*  It doesn't have to be an epigenetic thing.
*  But the sperm are generated at once every 60 days.
*  So the damage must be at the level of the germ cells
*  not having the proper machinery,
*  mitochondria or something like that.
*  Or the DNA repair machinery.
*  The DNA repair machinery could be defective
*  or could work less well in older people,
*  leading to the constant production of germ cells
*  with more mutation.
*  This is a possibility.
*  Do we know exactly what the DNA repair machinery is?
*  Yes.
*  There are many types of DNA repair.
*  There's one that use other copies of the DNA to correct.
*  There are ones that just recognize
*  all kinds of lesions on the DNA and remove it.
*  It's a very elaborate and complicated system.
*  And is it a system that is now tractable
*  that can be modified through pharmacology
*  or through anything like that?
*  So I don't know about drugs that improve it.
*  Maybe they exist and I'm not aware,
*  but it's very well understood
*  and many people are studying these directions.
*  Yeah, one thing that came across in the exploration
*  of the fertility work is that
*  what I'm about to describe is not legal in the US.
*  It is illegal, but is legal in the UK
*  and in other countries is this notion of three parent IVF
*  where it does seem that some of the eggs
*  that persist in older females don't,
*  even if fertilized, don't produce healthy embryos.
*  They have chromosomal abnormalities, replications,
*  and deletions that are problematic
*  for the development of the embryo,
*  such as trisomy 21, AKA Down syndrome.
*  Or in large part because of deficits
*  in the mitochondrial genome.
*  So what they now do is they take the,
*  because the mitochondrial genome
*  resides mainly in the cytoplasm,
*  they'll take an egg from the mother,
*  the sperm from the father,
*  but they'll take the nucleus from the mother
*  and put that into a cytoplasm of a younger woman
*  whose mitochondrial DNA is healthy,
*  then use the sperm to fertilize that egg
*  and that's why it's called three parent IVF,
*  then implant that into the mother.
*  And this has been done several times for,
*  in cases of mitochondrial damage
*  or mutations in the mother.
*  It works, the question is whether or not
*  those offspring will grow up to be healthy.
*  So this of course is not just a pure divergence,
*  it raises a bigger question that I have for you,
*  which is in terms of the work in either C. elegans
*  or in other model organisms,
*  but in particular in C. elegans,
*  where do you see this going next?
*  And if you would indulge us,
*  I would love you to tell us a little bit
*  about the admittedly unpublished work
*  that you're doing on temperature exposure and environments.
*  I mean, how malleable is this system?
*  Because to me, it just seems incredibly malleable
*  and yet a lot of it's still cloaked off to us.
*  There's still a ton to learn.
*  So assuming that we will discover similar things in humans,
*  which we don't know that this is the case,
*  but let's say we find.
*  I think there are many things you can do
*  before you change it.
*  For example, you could also change aberrant inheritance
*  by having the parent exercise, for example.
*  And some things like this have been done.
*  For example, there are experiments in rodents
*  where they show that overfeeding the rodents
*  creates problems for the next generation,
*  for the children.
*  However, if you let the rodent exercise,
*  then it corrects the aberrant inheritance.
*  So this is one possibility.
*  And you can also manipulate it at the source.
*  You can change, if it's RNAs,
*  let's say you could in the future,
*  perhaps if we understand how it works,
*  actually change the composition of the heritable RNAs.
*  By eating RNAs just like the worms?
*  Or RNA sandwich?
*  No, so the RNA sandwich would be difficult
*  because it's not, I don't know.
*  But if you do IVF, if you do any vitro fertilization,
*  you could perhaps change the composition of the RNAs
*  in the stuff that you introduce.
*  But way before that, what you could do,
*  perhaps even in the not so far future,
*  is use this for diagnostics.
*  DNA-based diagnostics for every couple
*  that wants to have a kid.
*  In Israel, this is done for most couples.
*  You can look at the DNA and look for genetic disease.
*  But no one is looking at the RNA at the moment.
*  If we understand how it works better,
*  we'll have another level, a whole new world to look at.
*  And perhaps there will be some RNAs
*  that correlate with disease that will say,
*  okay, the beauty is that this, unlike DNA, it's plastic.
*  So with DNA, this is your DNA,
*  perhaps we can choose another embryo.
*  But here you could say, perhaps, or again,
*  in the future, this is science fiction,
*  it doesn't happen now, but if we understand this
*  and it's true, we can say,
*  maybe you should run on the treadmill a little bit.
*  This will change the profile of your RNAs,
*  and then we will use it for IVF.
*  This seems more, because just it correlates
*  with healthy profiles of RNAs.
*  This is a level that no one looks at now
*  and holds great potential.
*  Again, with a disclaimer that we no know
*  how it works in humans at all.
*  Yeah.
*  Yes.
*  But of course, this is why it's so interesting.
*  Yeah, it's super interesting, incredibly promising.
*  So along the lines of things that one can do
*  in the short term, and your experiments on C. elegans,
*  I'd love for you to share with us
*  what you're observing about cold exposure
*  and how that impacts subsequent generations of C. elegans.
*  And if you would indulge us with the story
*  of this discovery, like some of the earlier stories
*  you told us, it is a surprising and fascinating one.
*  I'll gladly tell you about it.
*  This is not a story about transgeneration I inherited.
*  It's a story about memory within one generation.
*  Ah, excuse me, okay.
*  Within one generation, okay?
*  And as you said, the story of how it happens
*  is totally by accident, it's a funny story.
*  And I'm bringing this up because I know Dana Lanshaf
*  who's a huge fan of your post-docs will really be happy.
*  This is her work.
*  This is her work and this is unpublished work.
*  We didn't even finish it, so we're working on it.
*  Okay, well when it's published, we will feature the paper
*  because I love this story.
*  Oh, thanks a lot.
*  Great, so what happened is that
*  we talked about transgenerational memories.
*  And I said that in worms,
*  there are very long transgenerational memories.
*  If a generation time for C. elegans is three days,
*  some memories last for many generations.
*  So way beyond the lifespan of the worm.
*  The lifespan of the worm is three weeks, okay?
*  You have a new generation every three days,
*  but every worm lives for three weeks.
*  But there's a lot of research that shows that
*  unlike heritable memory, which can be very long,
*  the memories that the worms acquire during their lifetime
*  is very short-lived.
*  So if you teach something, after two hours, it forgets.
*  Okay?
*  So for example, you can teach the worm,
*  you can take an odor that it likes
*  and pair it with starvation,
*  and then it would dislike the odor.
*  And then there's a simple test, you just put it in a plate,
*  you put the odor in one side
*  and the control odor in the other side,
*  and you see whether it prefers this odor or not,
*  and it stops preferring it, okay?
*  There is 30 years or more of research,
*  40 years of research on this,
*  showing that the worms forget after two hours.
*  The reason I went to study C. elegans
*  is that I wanted to understand memory,
*  because such a simple nervous system,
*  you say maybe I have the potential
*  to actually understand how it works.
*  But this is slightly disappointing
*  because they forget after two hours.
*  So what is it exactly, okay?
*  My idea was, and I tried to convince students
*  to do it for 10 years, is to take the worms,
*  teach them this association to dislike the odor
*  that they innately like,
*  and then just put the worms in minus 80 and freeze them,
*  freeze them completely,
*  throw them and see whether they still remember
*  after they are thrown.
*  The Han Solo experiment.
*  And I didn't want to do it because of cryopreservation
*  or something like this.
*  I wanted to do it because, as you know better than me,
*  many theories about memory say
*  that you need electrical activity to maintain the memory.
*  You need to reverberate it in the brain.
*  During dreams or replay of the thing or whatever.
*  And if the memories will nevertheless be kept,
*  even though the worms were frozen in minus 80,
*  it would mean that it was kept in the absence of electricity
*  because there's no electricity in minus 80 degrees.
*  This was the idea.
*  I asked many students, no one wanted to do it
*  because it's not so easy and also a little crazy.
*  Well, and when the PI, the principal investigator,
*  or lab has a PET experiment,
*  no one wants to do that experiment.
*  That is true, that is the university tool.
*  So, and then I agreed to do it, done a luncheon.
*  I was very happy only later to find out
*  that she ignored me completely
*  and did a different experiment.
*  The experiment that Dada did instead
*  is to just take the worms, teach them the association
*  and place them on ice.
*  She wanted to see how the kinetics of memory
*  and forgetting change in low temperature
*  because maybe whatever memory is,
*  the breakdown of the memory is affected by the temperature.
*  A very simple idea.
*  We know that-
*  Different experiment.
*  Different experiment.
*  Yeah.
*  But a cool experiment.
*  Very cool.
*  And what she found is that when you place the worms on ice,
*  after you teach them, they just don't forget.
*  If they're even 10 times longer than control worms.
*  At that point, after 24 hours,
*  if no one worms forget after two hours,
*  after 24 hours, the worms will become sick.
*  So normally we do shorter experiments, okay?
*  But for two hours, the worms don't forget.
*  This is cool, but it was only the beginning
*  because the boring explanation is just what I just said.
*  Everything slows down in low temperatures.
*  So the breakdown of memory, again,
*  we don't know what it is, but whatever it is,
*  happens slower in low temperatures.
*  But this is not the case.
*  It's not merely the physical.
*  It's the response.
*  It's the changing of the internal state of the worms,
*  which affects the memory kinetics.
*  How do we know this?
*  There's a beautiful work over the last one years
*  on cold tolerance in C. elegans nematodes.
*  If you take the worms and you place them on ice,
*  like she did, but longer, for 48 hours, they all die.
*  However, if you take the worms,
*  acclimate them to lower temperatures for a few hours,
*  five hours at the minimum,
*  and then place them on ice, they all survive.
*  They become cold tolerant and people who study this show
*  that this involves changes in lipid metabolism
*  and many things.
*  So Dana took the worms, acclimated them
*  to slightly lower temperatures,
*  made them cold resistant,
*  and then taught them their association
*  and placed them on ice, and now they forgot immediately.
*  Which means that when they change their internal state
*  to become cold tolerant,
*  they no longer extend memories on ice,
*  which means it's not only the temperature,
*  because the temperature was anyway low.
*  Now they know the memory.
*  We took this as a starting point to understand
*  which genes change when the worms are becoming
*  cold tolerant on and off ice.
*  And we found genes that when you mutate them,
*  the worms just remember longer, always,
*  even when they're off ice,
*  because these are the genes that normally change
*  when they are surprised on the ice.
*  And these genes are expressed just in one pair of neurons,
*  just two out of the 302.
*  Notice he said 302, not 300.
*  And we can manipulate the activities of these genes
*  in these neurons to extend memory.
*  And then the punchline of everything that happened
*  is that we found out that this neuron,
*  where these genes function, this one pair of neuron,
*  is the only neuron in C. elegans
*  which is sensitive to lithium.
*  And lithium is a drug that is being given
*  to bipolar disorder patients for decades,
*  although it's not entirely clear how it works.
*  It's very, very interesting.
*  It's also interesting, there's an episode,
*  of course, in your podcast about this,
*  you know more about this than me a lot,
*  but it's also interesting because it's just an atom
*  created in the Big Bang, yet it works on our brains
*  in such a fundamental way.
*  And we wanted to see whether it works also on the worms,
*  because this neuron was tied to this memory extension
*  phenotype that we found.
*  So Danag grew the worms on lithium,
*  removed them from lithium,
*  taught them the association,
*  and found out that they learn a lot longer,
*  they remember a lot longer than control worms.
*  Not only that, if you first make the worms called tolerant,
*  and then lithium doesn't work on them.
*  So lithium switches this forgetfulness mechanism on and off.
*  Amazing.
*  And it's all connected to cold tolerance.
*  Amazing, and amazing for a number of reasons.
*  And so at risk of being long-winded in my response,
*  I just wanted to highlight something
*  that I think will be of relevance to most people,
*  which is when, at some point,
*  we did a few episodes on memory,
*  and highlighted a review that was written
*  by the great James McGaw,
*  one of the great mammalian memory researchers,
*  who's worked a lot on humans and mice.
*  And I was shocked, pun intended,
*  and amused to learn that in medieval times,
*  if people wanted children to remember lessons,
*  they could be religious lessons or school doctrine,
*  or whatever it was, mathematics,
*  they would take children, teach them,
*  and then throw them into cold water
*  to introduce a memory instilling event.
*  And we now know that the memory instilling event
*  is the release of adrenaline in the body,
*  which makes perfect sense
*  if you think about traumatic events,
*  but this whole general mechanism also applies
*  to the learning of other types of information.
*  And so if I understand correctly about the role of lithium
*  and the role of cold in the experiments
*  that you just described,
*  there's some general state switch,
*  some internal state switch that says,
*  what happened in the minutes or hours preceding this
*  was important.
*  It acts as sort of like a highlighter pen
*  in the book of experiences.
*  Exactly.
*  And I'm absolutely curious to know
*  whether or not this is an RNA dependent mechanism
*  in some way.
*  So is this literally like the highlighter
*  in the IKEA instruction book?
*  This we don't know.
*  This we don't know.
*  And as I said, this is not even a finished work.
*  It's not peer reviewed.
*  It's just the state that I told you about,
*  but it's very exciting for me to go into this new field.
*  And once it's out, I'd be happy to talk more about it
*  and think about the implications and the connections
*  to other things and more about the mechanisms.
*  Yeah, well, thank you for sharing it with us,
*  despite the fact that it's not finished.
*  People now know that it's also not finished.
*  And I love a good cliffhanger.
*  So we await the full conclusion
*  and interpretation of these results.
*  Today, you've taken us on an amazing journey
*  through the genome, RNA, short interfering RNAs,
*  a ton of history of prior experiments,
*  some of which ended tragically,
*  many of which unfortunately did not.
*  And they were true triumphs.
*  And in particular, the work in your laboratory,
*  which is just incredible.
*  And also this introduction of model organisms.
*  So, and I only mentioned a short handful of the things
*  that you've taught us about today.
*  So first I wanna extend thanks for the incredible teaching.
*  I also wanna say thank you for something equally important,
*  which is that absolutely came through,
*  but is what initially brought me to explore you
*  and your work more, although I had certainly heard of you,
*  which is that your spirit and kind of approach to biology
*  is an extremely unique and intoxicating one.
*  It's even, I venture to call it seductive.
*  It's, you know, there's a,
*  I do believe that whether or not it's music or poetry
*  or science or mathematics,
*  that the spirit behind something
*  dictates the amount of intelligence and precision
*  with which that thing is carried out.
*  And it absolutely comes through.
*  So if I'm making you feel on the spot about this,
*  I've succeeded.
*  Thank you, thank you very much.
*  But I know that the listeners can feel it.
*  It's a felt thing.
*  So thank you.
*  There are many scientists out there,
*  fewer with this phenotype and even fewer that,
*  you know, I think they can communicate
*  with such articulate precision.
*  So thank you so much.
*  Thank you.
*  It's been a real pleasure.
*  Pleasure was all mine.
*  Thanks a lot.
*  Great, well, we'll do it again
*  and we'll learn about all the incredible things
*  you're doing trying to transform science,
*  as it were, at the level of publishing,
*  at the level of social media,
*  because there's a whole other discussion there.
*  Meanwhile, we will, of course,
*  point people in the direction of you
*  and to learn more about your work.
*  And I look forward to hearing the conclusion
*  of Dana's studies.
*  Thanks a lot.
*  It's been a real pleasure.
*  Thank you for joining me today
