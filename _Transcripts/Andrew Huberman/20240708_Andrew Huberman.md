Video Description: In this episode, my guest is Dr. Matthew Hill, a professor of cell biology and anatomy at the Hotchkiss Brain Institute at the University of Calgary and an expert on the biology of cannabis. We discuss how cannabis affects the brain to produce its psychoactive effects (feeling “high”), including altered time perception, focus, memory, appetite, and stress.

We discuss how THC vs. cannabidiol (CBD) affects the brain, the effects of different routes of cannabis administration (e.g., smoking, vaping, edibles), high-potency THC, and whether cannabis is addictive. We discuss if there is a link between cannabis use and the development of psychosis, anxiety, bipolar depression, or schizophrenia. 

We discuss whether CBD has clinical benefits in regulating stress, promoting sleep, and treating certain diseases. We also discuss if there are real and consistent differences in the biological effects of different cannabis strains, if cannabis impacts hormones, and the uses of cannabis for the management of pain, stress, Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and nausea.

Listeners of this episode will get an up-to-date understanding of what is currently known about how cannabis affects the brain and body, including both its potential benefits and risks.

# Dr. Matthew Hill: How Cannabis Impacts Health & the Potential Risks
**Andrew Huberman:** [July 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jouFvyRZntk)
*  Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
*  where we discuss science
*  and science-based tools for everyday life.
*  I'm Andrew Huberman,
*  and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
*  at Stanford School of Medicine.
*  My guest today is Dr. Matthew Hill.
*  Dr. Matthew Hill is a professor of cell biology and anatomy
*  at the University of Calgary.
*  His laboratory studies cannabis and its effects on stress,
*  its effects on feeding,
*  and its effects on the behavioral impacts
*  of cannabis exposure at different stages of development.
*  The origin of today's podcast episode is a bit unique,
*  so I'd like to share a little bit
*  of that background with you.
*  Previously, I did a solo episode
*  of the Huberman Lab Podcast about cannabis,
*  the biology of cannabis,
*  some of its medical applications and uses,
*  as well as some of its potential harms.
*  That episode came out several years ago now
*  and remains a very popular episode.
*  It's had millions of views and millions of listens.
*  Several months ago, we posted a clip of that episode
*  to X, formerly known as Twitter.
*  And Dr. Matthew Hill responded to that clip on X
*  with criticism about the specific points
*  made within that clip.
*  Most notably, my discussion of the data
*  that cannabis use can, in some individuals, cause psychosis.
*  He also took issue with some of the specific points
*  I made in that clip related to potential differences
*  in the biology of the effects
*  of different strains of cannabis,
*  most notably, indica versus sativa strains,
*  and a few other points as well.
*  Now, as somebody who's been in the field of science
*  for several decades now, I'm very familiar with the fact
*  that every field, every single field within science
*  has debates within it, controversies,
*  and sometimes outright battles.
*  And to me, that's part of what makes science interesting.
*  It's an evolving process.
*  It's something for which we should all be very curious
*  to try and understand what we know, what we don't know,
*  and try and get to the real answers.
*  So right off the bat on X,
*  I invited Dr. Hill onto the podcast,
*  and he accepted the invitation.
*  So today's episode is really a unique one
*  in that, first of all, we cover an enormous amount
*  of biology and clinical data as it relates to cannabis,
*  meaning today's discussion is not a debate.
*  It is really an up-to-date discussion
*  about how cannabis works.
*  So we talk about THC versus CBD.
*  We address the question of whether or not indicas
*  versus sativas have different biological
*  and subjective effects or not.
*  We, of course, talk about the potential correlation,
*  maybe even causation, between cannabis use and psychosis.
*  I think you'll find that discussion very interesting.
*  And we talk about how cannabis relates to hunger,
*  to memory, to anxiety, and to the treatment of anxiety.
*  I'm certain that given the widespread use
*  of cannabis nowadays, that you'll find the discussion
*  to be both an informative and potentially useful one
*  that could help guide decisions as to whether or not
*  you or others should or should not use or avoid cannabis,
*  as well as one that can simply inform
*  about this very interesting compound.
*  And of course, you'll learn a lot of neuroscience
*  and biology along the way.
*  Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
*  is separate from my teaching research roles at Stanford.
*  It is, however, part of my desire and effort
*  to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
*  and science-related tools to the general public.
*  In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors
*  of today's podcast.
*  Our first sponsor is 8 Sleep.
*  8 Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling,
*  heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
*  I've spoken many times before on this podcast
*  about the critical need to get sleep,
*  both enough sleep and enough quality sleep.
*  Now, one of the key things to getting a great night's sleep
*  is that your body temperature actually has to drop
*  by about one to three degrees in order for you to fall
*  and stay deeply asleep.
*  And to wake up feeling refreshed,
*  your body temperature actually has to increase
*  by about one to three degrees.
*  One of the best ways to ensure all of that happens
*  is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment.
*  And with 8 Sleep, it's very easy to do that.
*  You program the temperature that you want
*  at the beginning, middle, and the end of the night,
*  and that's the temperature that you're going to sleep at.
*  And it will track your sleep.
*  It tells you how much slow wave sleep you're getting,
*  how much rapid eye movement sleep you're getting,
*  which is critical.
*  And all of that also helps you dial in
*  the exact parameters you need
*  in order to get the best possible night's sleep for you.
*  I've been sleeping on an 8 Sleep mattress cover
*  for well over three years now,
*  and it has completely transformed my sleep for the better.
*  8 Sleep recently launched
*  their newest generation pod cover, the Pod 4 Ultra.
*  The Pod 4 Ultra cover has improved cooling
*  and heating capacity, higher fidelity
*  sleep tracking technology,
*  and the Pod 4 cover has snoring detection
*  that will automatically lift your head a few degrees
*  to improve airflow and stop your snoring.
*  If you'd like to try an 8 Sleep mattress cover,
*  you can go to 8sleep.com slash Huberman
*  to save $350 off their Pod 4 Ultra.
*  8 Sleep currently ships to the USA, Canada, UK,
*  select countries in the EU and Australia.
*  Again, that's 8sleep.com slash Huberman.
*  Today's episode is also brought to us by Element.
*  Element is an electrolyte drink
*  that has everything you need and nothing you don't.
*  That means the electrolytes, sodium, magnesium,
*  and potassium in the correct ratios, but no sugar.
*  Now I and others on the podcast have talked a lot
*  about the critical importance of hydration
*  for proper brain and bodily function.
*  Research shows that even a slight degree of dehydration
*  can really diminish cognitive and physical performance.
*  It's also important that you get adequate electrolytes
*  in order for your body and brain to function at their best.
*  The electrolytes, sodium, magnesium, and potassium
*  are critical for the functioning of all the cells
*  in your body, especially your neurons or nerve cells.
*  To make sure that I'm getting proper amounts
*  of hydration in electrolytes,
*  I dissolve one packet of Element
*  in about 16 to 32 ounces of water
*  when I wake up in the morning,
*  and I drink that basically first thing in the morning.
*  I also drink Element dissolved in water
*  during any kind of physical exercise I'm doing,
*  especially on hot days if I'm sweating a lot
*  and losing water and electrolytes.
*  If you'd like to try Element,
*  you can go to drinkelement.com slash Huberman,
*  spelled drinklmnt.com slash Huberman
*  to claim a free Element sample pack
*  with the purchase of any Element drink mix.
*  Again, that's drinkelement.com slash Huberman
*  to claim a free sample pack.
*  Today's episode is also brought to us by BetterHelp.
*  BetterHelp offers professional therapy
*  with a licensed therapist carried out entirely online.
*  There are essentially three things
*  that make up great therapy.
*  First of all, great therapy consists of having good rapport
*  with somebody that you can really trust
*  and talk to about the issues that you're dealing with.
*  Second of all, that therapist should provide support
*  in the form of emotional support or directed guidance.
*  And third, expert therapy should provide useful insights,
*  insights that allow you to better understand
*  not just your emotional life and your relationship life,
*  but of course also your relationship to yourself
*  and to career goals and school goals,
*  meaning excellent therapy should also inspire
*  positive action.
*  BetterHelp makes it very easy for you
*  to find an expert therapist
*  with whom you really resonate with
*  and that can provide the benefits that I just described.
*  Also, because BetterHelp therapy is done entirely online,
*  it's very time efficient
*  and it's easy to fit into a busy schedule
*  because it involves no commuting to a therapist's office,
*  finding a parking spot or sitting in a waiting room.
*  If you'd like to try BetterHelp,
*  you can go to betterhelp.com slash Huberman
*  to get 10% off your first month.
*  Again, that's betterhelp.com slash Huberman.
*  And now for my discussion with Dr. Matthew Hill.
*  Dr. Matt Hill, welcome.
*  Thanks for having me.
*  Delighted to have you here
*  because you're an expert in the biology of cannabis,
*  a topic that many, many people are curious about
*  for a variety of reasons.
*  So just to kick things off,
*  maybe we can get people up to speed on what cannabis is.
*  So a little bit about how it works in the brain and body
*  to produce the various effects that it produces
*  and how some of that comes to be.
*  And then we can dig into some of the nuance.
*  I have a lot of questions about different types,
*  if you will, of cannabis,
*  the relationship to mental health,
*  potentially to mental illness.
*  We're gonna drill into all of that.
*  So just to kick things off, what is cannabis?
*  I mean, cannabis is a plant
*  that has been around for some time.
*  It's kind of got like a very rich history
*  of use around the world for different cultures,
*  for both kind of medicinal and spiritual
*  and recreational purposes over several centuries.
*  The plant has kind of become,
*  I mean, in the West, it really wasn't a thing,
*  mainstream wise until about the 60s.
*  And then it became kind of introduced as like a drug
*  of choice that a lot of people started using
*  during the rise of the hippie era.
*  And I think that was a lot of the time
*  that cannabis got popularized.
*  And then I'd say more recently,
*  cannabis has, into the 90s and on,
*  has become kind of a very heavily used drug
*  by a large swath of people ranging from teenagers on up.
*  In terms of what it is inside it,
*  I mean, it's a plant with a lot of very complex chemistry
*  and biology behind it.
*  So there's a lot of molecules that it carries in it.
*  We call these cannabinoids.
*  And they come in a lot of different flavors.
*  But the main one that's the most important one
*  when we talk about cannabis
*  and what drives the kind of intoxicating
*  and what I would refer to as psychoactive effects
*  of cannabis is Delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol
*  or what we call THC.
*  And that really is what dictates the psychoactive
*  and intoxicating properties of the plant.
*  And so the amount of THC that is within the cannabis plant
*  will influence how high a person's gonna get
*  when they consume it.
*  There are probably 70 to a hundred and some odd
*  other cannabinoids that are within cannabis.
*  Most of them are pretty trace levels
*  and they vary from different types
*  to cannabis from one another.
*  But the other one that's had a lot of attention
*  is Cannabidiol or what we call CBD.
*  CBD is structurally looks pretty similar to THC
*  but doesn't behave anything like THC.
*  It's not intoxicating at all.
*  I'm not sure, I would probably say it's not psychoactive
*  in the sense that people can't tell if they're on it or not.
*  But I would, some people still say it's psychoactive
*  because people claim it can affect anxiety state
*  or mood state or other things.
*  So in that context, maybe psychoactive is still
*  somewhat appropriate of a word to use.
*  And then there's a whole bunch of other things
*  like cannabinol, Cannabigerol,
*  and these other minor cannabinoids.
*  Most of which we really don't understand any of the biology
*  of, we don't know what they're doing.
*  They may influence some of the effects of THC,
*  they may not, but they're there.
*  And they vary in their composition from different flavor
*  of different cannabis to different flavor.
*  And then there's those other things called terpenes
*  which are kind of highly volatile compounds,
*  but they're not specific to cannabis,
*  they're found in tons of other plants.
*  So this is a lot of which seems to contribute
*  at least to some of the smell and the flavors of cannabis.
*  So these are things like limonene,
*  which gives some cannabis kind of a citrusy odor
*  or flavor to it.
*  Pinene, which gives things more of like
*  a earthy tree kind of smell.
*  Beta-karyophylline, mercine, and these terpenes are also,
*  some of which do have known biological activity,
*  some don't, and they vary quite heavily
*  across different kinds of cannabis as well.
*  And again, there's some thought that they may be influencing
*  some of the psychoactive or intoxicating properties
*  of cannabis, but the reality is we really don't know
*  a lot about them at this point.
*  There's kind of some emerging work
*  that's starting to come out now that kind of plays with,
*  you know, giving someone THC and adding in one other terpene
*  or one other minor cannabinoid
*  and seeing how it influences things.
*  And so you can imagine with the plethora of molecules
*  that exist in cannabis, doing this in a piecewise manner
*  could take decades to kind of really get to a point
*  where we understand all the interactive components
*  of cannabis, but people tend to refer to this
*  as like an entourage effect.
*  That's kind of a phrase that gets used quite widely
*  in the cannabis world.
*  And the idea behind that is that if you took pure THC,
*  and so there are some like distillate pens
*  and things that exist out there now in the product market,
*  which are basically isolated THC with trace levels
*  of anything of other stuff would be very different
*  than if you had THC in combination
*  with some of these other molecules
*  and how they might influence how THC itself
*  is working or not, so.
*  Fascinating plant.
*  You mentioned the psychoactive effects.
*  Some people listening to this and watching this
*  presumably have experienced those psychoactive effects.
*  Others perhaps have not.
*  How could we describe for both groups
*  what the quote unquote psychoactive effects are?
*  You mentioned the higher the concentration of THC,
*  the quote unquote higher someone will get, right?
*  The greater the intensity of the high.
*  What is the high?
*  And I know people are probably chuckling saying,
*  does Huberman not know because he's never done it?
*  I mean, that's my own business.
*  I just want people to understand
*  what you mean by psychoactive effects.
*  So I mean, the way that people would usually describe
*  the intoxicating effects of cannabis is,
*  they would, I mean, people often refer to it
*  as there being some euphoria or some positive mood,
*  not on the same order as what people would describe
*  with say cocaine or some other stimulants,
*  but there certainly is some kind of positive aspect.
*  I mean, if there wasn't, people wouldn't be using it
*  if they didn't feel positive about it afterwards.
*  There can be, you know, other aspects
*  in terms of changes in feeding behavior.
*  People might find things funnier than they found things.
*  It might change the way they perceive
*  various environmental stimuli.
*  But it can also, for some people,
*  create a bit of a dissociative state to some degree
*  where people might feel a little bit out of body.
*  So it's kind of a complicated intoxicating state
*  to describe, I would say,
*  because usually if someone's referring to something
*  like a stimulant, they're just like,
*  oh, people feel like they're God, they're like, you know.
*  Possibility everywhere.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  Like they're very happy and they're kind of jacked up.
*  And I think with cannabis,
*  the way people would describe it would be very different.
*  It's like kind of an introspective state.
*  You might be more aware of your bodily feelings
*  and states that are going on inside you,
*  your kind of internal state,
*  but you also have like a different perspective
*  on external stimuli.
*  You might process information a bit differently,
*  focus on things a bit differently.
*  So it's kind of a complicated state to describe.
*  I would say usually when people are assessing
*  if someone's intoxicated,
*  like the kind of lab work
*  where people get someone high,
*  they just kind of use what we call a visual analog scale,
*  which is like a one to a hundred or something,
*  or a zero to a hundred and say,
*  do you feel high?
*  Do you enjoy this?
*  Would you say you feel euphoric?
*  Is your mood elevated?
*  So they're kind of scaling things like that.
*  So I think that's more typically in a lab setting,
*  how you would define if someone's high or not from it.
*  And this is why when people do studies
*  with something like a placebo cannabis
*  or a very low THC cannabis,
*  you'll see kind of a scaling.
*  So even if you give someone a placebo cannabis,
*  if they think that they're getting cannabis,
*  a lot of people still respond by saying,
*  they feel a bit high.
*  That's interesting.
*  Is that true even if they've never used cannabis before?
*  I'm not actually certain if you are allowed
*  to have someone in a drug study,
*  if they've never done something before.
*  I think they have to have had some previous experience
*  with a drug to be enrolled.
*  And they pay you, so now pot smokers everywhere
*  are running to look at stuff.
*  Yeah, but I think, yeah,
*  I don't think you can use drug naive people.
*  I mean, I don't run human clinical lab studies,
*  so I can't explicitly say it,
*  but that's my understanding is that someone has to have had
*  even limited, like, you know, not much,
*  but at least once or twice.
*  They have to have experienced the drug before.
*  So I don't know if you would take someone
*  who was completely blind,
*  because I don't know how they would replicate that state
*  if they're not expecting it.
*  What about the effects of cannabis on time perception?
*  You know, there's this reputation that cannabis has
*  for disrupting time perception,
*  that people will think a long period of time has passed
*  when in fact very little time has passed.
*  Maybe it's sometimes even the reverse.
*  Is the mechanism by which cannabis
*  can adjust time perception known?
*  I wouldn't say it's well worked out.
*  There definitely seems to be some, like, temporal dilation,
*  like you're saying, where people think things of,
*  you know, someone will be high and someone will ask them,
*  how long do you think time has passed?
*  They would report usually longer periods of time have passed
*  than actually have.
*  I feel like there is some older work,
*  I could dig up to see if I could find,
*  that is either in, like, it might even be in pigeons,
*  but it might be in rodents
*  that's looking at, like, temporal ordering,
*  and they give animals cannabinoids,
*  and that's kind of a cleaner way of seeing,
*  because they are very good at learning,
*  like, if I wait 10 minutes and then I engage in a behavior,
*  I get a reward, and so you can really train animals
*  to have this ordinal timing
*  where they kind of know distinct periods of time,
*  and if they give them cannabinoids, they respond differently,
*  so in that context, it does still seem to produce some state
*  where there's an altered perception of time passing,
*  and so I think if we were gonna really understand
*  the mechanism of it, that would probably be the way to go,
*  but I'm not super familiar with the work,
*  because no one's, I mean,
*  anything I can think of is pretty old.
*  I can't think of anything modern
*  where people have actually looked at this.
*  Interesting.
*  You mentioned effects of cannabis on appetite,
*  and I know one of the medical uses of cannabis
*  is in people that are undergoing treatment for cancer
*  in order to stimulate appetite,
*  because oftentimes they have very low or even no appetite
*  due to the cancer treatment.
*  Is the mechanism by which cannabis can stimulate appetite
*  known, and if so, what is the general trend of effect?
*  Makes people hungrier, obviously,
*  but we hear, again, in kind of recreational terms
*  of people getting the munchies,
*  you know, becoming exceedingly hungry.
*  Is that related to some cannabis-induced effect
*  on, say, blood sugar, like insulin or glucose regulation,
*  or is it happening at a different level?
*  I think we almost need to take a step back, actually,
*  to talk about how cannabis works in the brain
*  before we kind of go into that, so THC as a molecule
*  exerts almost all its effects through acting at this
*  one receptor for the most part
*  that's widely expressed through the brain
*  called the cannabinoid type one receptor.
*  CB1.
*  Yeah, CB1 is the shorthand for it,
*  and I think, you know, as people tend to create analogies
*  to describe what receptors are, for those of you who don't know,
*  most people use like a lock and key analogy
*  that like a receptor would be a protein that sits on a cell
*  and a molecule that binds to it,
*  like THC is the key that fits in that lock.
*  When it activates it, it triggers some biological process
*  in the cell, in this case a neuron,
*  that changes its activity in some capacity.
*  And so THC acts on these CB1 receptors,
*  which are very widely expressed, in fact,
*  outside of like kind of ion channels
*  that are expressed in the brain.
*  The CB1 is, I think, one of the most,
*  if not the most widely expressed receptor in the brain.
*  It's everywhere.
*  So it's really important.
*  And I think as kind of you had alluded to previously,
*  it doesn't exist in the, you know,
*  this didn't evolve in humans in the hopes
*  that one day humans would find cannabis.
*  This is just-
*  Although cannabis users everywhere use that argument.
*  I know people love to leverage things.
*  If it's a plant, it's, you know, it's natural and safe.
*  And there's obviously issues we'll talk about with that.
*  But I mean, really this is just biological redundancy.
*  I mean, you know, nature only has so many ways
*  to create something.
*  And so there's gonna be things that end up overlapping
*  in the way that they function.
*  And so the receptor that's in the brain
*  and throughout the body, the CB1,
*  and there is also a CB2 receptor,
*  it's not really expressed in the brain.
*  It's in some of the immune cells in the brain
*  and maybe some limited distribution
*  in actual brain cell neurons.
*  Where in the body is it expressed?
*  It's mostly immune cells.
*  So you'll see CB2 is mostly on like macrophages
*  or other kinds of immune cells.
*  Cells that gobble up debris.
*  Yeah, and that basically, you know,
*  regulate inflammatory processes.
*  And so the main role of CB2 seems to be much more
*  about like regulating inflammation.
*  So that's kind of a separate role
*  that can certainly impact the brain in different ways.
*  But when we talk about the effects
*  on the central nervous system in the brain and behavior,
*  we're talking almost entirely about CB1.
*  And so both the CB1 and CB2 receptors, like I said,
*  don't exist because nature was like,
*  humans are gonna find cannabis.
*  So this will all work together now.
*  So there are molecules our body produces,
*  which we call endocannabinoids.
*  And they are kind of funny little molecules
*  because they don't really behave,
*  like certainly in the brain,
*  they don't behave like a normal neurotransmitter.
*  So I mean, I assume most people who listen to your podcast
*  are relatively adept with the basic idea
*  of how neurons work.
*  So you have neuron A,
*  let's call it the presynaptic neuron
*  because you have that gap between the two cells
*  where they communicate called the synapse.
*  So neuron A releases a transmitter
*  and it can be something that excites the neighboring cell,
*  neuron B, or it can inhibit it.
*  And so the way that we always kind of talk about
*  neurotransmission in the brain is neuron A
*  releases a chemical that crosses the synapse,
*  acts on neuron B, and it can either, you know,
*  jack that neuron's activity up or it can scale it down.
*  And that affects, you know,
*  brain wide patterns of activity.
*  And we call that anterograde
*  because it moves from neuron A to neuron B,
*  which is kind of the general flow of things
*  and how we usually think about it.
*  So endocannabinoids are kind of this, you know,
*  little bit of an oddity in the sense
*  that they could do the reverse.
*  And so endocannabinoids are actually made in neuron B
*  on the postsynaptic side,
*  and then they go backwards and act on neuron A
*  to regulate how much transmitter is released.
*  And so in many ways, this is like,
*  I kind of liken it to a thermostat model for the most part.
*  Certainly if we're talking about something like excitability.
*  So if neuron A is dumping out something
*  that excites neuron B, like glutamate,
*  which is an excitatory neurotransmitter,
*  as neuron B gets too excited,
*  it's gonna start releasing endocannabinoids
*  to go back and tell neuron A to stop driving it.
*  So sort of a homeostatic scale
*  and trying to maintain a middle range.
*  Yeah, I mean, at the end of the day,
*  no matter how you discuss it and what system you discuss it,
*  I think the majority of people in the cannabinoid field
*  would agree that the primary physiological role
*  of endocannabinoids is to maintain homeostasis.
*  That's what they do.
*  They keep everything in its happy place, let's say.
*  So like-
*  And that's probably why the CB1 receptor
*  is so widely distributed.
*  Is that neurons can excite or inhibit each other.
*  That is raise or reduce the amount of electrical activity
*  in the, let's say nearby neuron,
*  because we were talking about retrograde signaling.
*  But ultimately you don't want runaway excitation,
*  that looks like epilepsy.
*  Exactly.
*  And you don't want runaway inhibition
*  because that looks like suppression of ability to think,
*  move, et cetera.
*  Exactly.
*  So you wanna keep things in where they should be.
*  And so you want neurons to get excited,
*  but you don't want them to get overexcited.
*  And so endocannabinoids in kind of a very prototypical sense
*  act as this circuit breaker, essentially,
*  where they go back and gate how much is coming in.
*  And they do this through various mechanisms,
*  essentially turning off the electrical activity
*  of that presynaptic neuron
*  so that it stops releasing neurotransmitter.
*  They can also regulate though,
*  inhibitory neurotransmitter release as well.
*  And this is usually done through a little bit more
*  of a complex process where it's driven by excitation,
*  but then it regulates the inhibitory pathway.
*  So inhibiting the inhibitor leads to more excitation.
*  Exactly.
*  I usually liken it to basically taking the brakes off
*  of a car while you're going downhill kind of thing.
*  Like you're, you know,
*  you'd use your braking system to keep things in check,
*  but if you wanna go faster,
*  you take the foot off the brakes
*  and you let things accelerate.
*  And so this can be really important for things like
*  forms of synaptic plasticity or neuroplasticity,
*  let's say where you want synaptic strengthening to happen.
*  So like under a learning event or something,
*  you want that synapse to really hardwire better.
*  And so having endocannabinoids kind of turn off
*  the inhibitory component is one of the mechanisms
*  to facilitate that.
*  But at the same time,
*  if you wanna have a bit more adaptive flexibility,
*  endocannabinoids can weaken that synapse at the same time
*  by acting right at the excitatory terminal itself.
*  And so their ability to kind of play
*  with the relative activity of a circuit
*  is really dependent on which neuron they're acting on.
*  And so they can regulate excitation
*  or inhibition differentially.
*  And I mean, CB1 receptors are found on virtually
*  every single kind of neuron in the brain.
*  Except one, I think you'll find this interesting
*  because it's dopamine.
*  And dopamine neurons are basically the only neurons
*  in the brain that don't really
*  at least as far as we've been able to characterize to date
*  express cannabinoid receptors.
*  Interesting.
*  If I may, earlier you mentioned
*  one of the potential psychoactive effects of cannabis
*  is euphoria.
*  Does that mean that the euphoria associated
*  with cannabis use is independent of dopamine
*  and is more reliant on something like perhaps
*  the opioid receptor system
*  or the serotonergic receptor system?
*  I wouldn't say that cannabinoids don't affect dopamine
*  because what we understand in the ventral tegmental area,
*  which is kind of the hotspot of dopamine neurons,
*  or at least the ones that are involved
*  in motivation and stuff,
*  those neurons are regulated by a lot of inhibitory neurons
*  that dump out inhibitory transmitter
*  and keep those neurons kind of quiet.
*  So there's an opportunity for indirect regulation.
*  Exactly, so what you have is those neurons
*  that regulate the dopamine neurons
*  are very rich in cannabinoid receptors.
*  This is actually kind of similar
*  to how mu-opioid receptors work for things like morphine
*  or heroin.
*  And essentially what the cannabinoid receptors will do
*  is when they're activated,
*  they'll turn off that inhibitory control
*  and that allows dopamine neurons to kind of move
*  into a state where they're more prone
*  to go into burst firing and have big dumps of dopamine.
*  Whether or not that relates to the positive effect
*  of the euphoria,
*  I don't think anyone has cleanly demonstrated that.
*  I mean, obviously dopamine's very complicated
*  in terms of its relation to endpoints
*  and whether it's reward or motivation.
*  But cannabinoids definitely do have an influence
*  on dopamine transmission.
*  They just don't tend to do it directly.
*  And I think that's this very bizarre
*  and interesting component of cannabinoid signaling
*  is why the brain would have evolved in a way
*  to allow every other neurotransmitter system
*  to be actively and directly regulated by endocannabinoids,
*  but dopamine has kind of spared from this.
*  So I don't know.
*  No one, I mean, obviously you can always just theoretically
*  guess as to why someone would do that.
*  I don't know what the reason for it would be,
*  but it is something that has kind of intrigued
*  a lot of people because every other system in the brain
*  is so tightly controlled to some degree by endocannabinoids
*  and then this one circuit is kind of free of it.
*  So, but yeah, so the main role of endocannabinoids
*  is really to regulate plasticity or homeostasis,
*  allow flexibility of circuits to either goose up
*  their activity or ramp it down if they need to,
*  depending on the environment,
*  depending on the experience of the organism.
*  So there's a lot of kind of roles
*  that endocannabinoids play in that domain.
*  But even within the endocannabinoids,
*  I mean, there's two primary endocannabinoids.
*  And again, this is one of the weird things
*  about how endocannabinoids work
*  because if you talk about things like serotonin or dopamine,
*  you have a single molecule that gets released
*  in the typical anterograde way
*  and it diversifies at the level of a receptor.
*  So serotonin has like, I don't know,
*  like 15 receptors or 20 or something, no.
*  Dopamine has at least five.
*  And so the different actions that serotonin or dopamine
*  will have is all driven by the diversification
*  of the receptors, it's one molecule.
*  Whereas cannabinoids are the reverse,
*  not only do they work backwards across the synapse
*  and work in this retrograde fashion,
*  but really you have one receptor
*  that is regulated by two molecules.
*  So the diversification happens more at the level
*  of the molecule than at the receptor,
*  which is again, very unique.
*  And the two molecules that we know
*  are kind of the bona fide endocannabinoids,
*  there could be more.
*  They're called anandamide,
*  which is actually kind of a funny name
*  because it comes from the Sanskrit word anand for bliss.
*  And so Rafi Mishulam, who was in Israel
*  when he discovered the molecule, you know,
*  30 odd years ago, wanted it to reflect inner bliss.
*  And so he named it anandamide.
*  So it's like inner bliss with an amide bond
*  is kind of the joke he had for it.
*  And so-
*  He discovered anandamide and decided to call it bliss
*  because he had familiarity with cannabis
*  or because he took anandamide as a direct experience.
*  No, no, I mean-
*  It takes a lot for a scientist to discover a molecule,
*  but then for a scientist to discover a molecule
*  and then name it bliss for a particular reason,
*  you have to speculate that they had some familiarity
*  with the compound.
*  Rafi Mishulam was also the guy who isolated
*  and discovered THC.
*  So I mean, he has a very,
*  he's kind of the grandfather of whole cannabinoid field.
*  So he has a landmark paper from 1964, which ironically,
*  and this is one of these weird pop culture things,
*  I don't know if this is true,
*  that paper was published on April 20th, 1964.
*  And so the joke is, is this where 420 came from?
*  Because the original like birthdate
*  of the first THC paper was 420, 1964.
*  Well, now that potential myth
*  is definitely gonna propagate.
*  But yeah, so he had been in the field for a while.
*  And so he had studied cannabis on that side.
*  And then in 1990, his lab isolated anandamide
*  as being the first molecule
*  that activated the receptor endogenously.
*  And so it was kind of, yeah,
*  I think it was a little tongue in cheek
*  that he named it the way he did.
*  A few years later, the second molecule,
*  which is just called 2-arachidonal glycerol,
*  or what we call 2AG, that was discovered kind of in tandem,
*  both again by Mishulam, but also by a Japanese group.
*  And so we understand these two molecules
*  don't do the same thing.
*  Like they are a bit different.
*  So the way anandamide binds the receptor is,
*  it's what we would call a high affinity,
*  but low efficacy agonist or molecule at least.
*  And what I mean by that is very low levels of anandamide
*  are required to actually bind to the receptor.
*  But once it binds,
*  its ability to stimulate a biological response
*  in that neuron kind of caps out pretty fast.
*  So it doesn't have like a sledgehammer effect.
*  Whereas 2AG seems to require a bit more concentration
*  in the synapse to be able to bind to the receptor
*  so it has a lower affinity for the receptor.
*  But once it binds to the receptor,
*  it's like pretty heavy duty.
*  So it evokes a very robust intracellular signaling response.
*  And so why we have two endocannabinoids,
*  we're not totally sure.
*  Some of us have theories.
*  I'm of the camp that I think they may play
*  somewhat differential roles,
*  either based on the synapse or the circuit
*  that they're working in,
*  or this idea that maybe anandamide
*  might be more of a tonic molecule.
*  And what I mean by that is,
*  we'll say it's like a stage setter.
*  So like anandamide might just be kind of made by neurons
*  on an ongoing basis and just released.
*  And its job may be to kind of keep the steady state
*  of a brain circuit in a desired range
*  so that under resting conditions,
*  it's not too active or too quiet.
*  Your thermostat analogy is perfect here.
*  So in that context,
*  it kind of is like just the thermostat of the house.
*  Whereas 2AG is like, let's say the pinch hitter
*  who gets brought in to do the heavy lifting.
*  And so 2AG during a situation like, let's say,
*  something like even like a seizure is an extreme example.
*  We have a huge amount of neural activity.
*  Those neurons that are getting heavily activated
*  during massive amounts of neural activity
*  start dumping out huge amounts of 2AG.
*  And that acts as the,
*  okay, we really need to turn off this circuit very quickly
*  in this situation.
*  And in most of these forms of like synaptic plasticity,
*  like I was saying earlier,
*  where you need to either strengthen or weaken a synapse
*  in response to a change in the environment
*  or in response to an experience or something that's going on,
*  most of that is driven by 2AG signaling.
*  And so, you know, all these forms of like
*  turning things up or down in a kind of rapid
*  and on-demand manner,
*  that's mostly 2AG.
*  So most people who study like neurophysiology
*  and like record activity in neurons
*  and look at endocannabinoids,
*  they're almost entirely talking about 2AG
*  when they play with stuff.
*  So yeah, that's kind of one of the ways we do it.
*  We say that anandamide may be more tonic
*  and 2AG might be more phasic
*  and like brought online when needed, but doesn't do a lot.
*  There is some evidence that 2AG may also have a role
*  to regulate some circuits
*  under kind of resting conditions as well.
*  And there's certainly some situations
*  where anandamide might get brought into play
*  to affect plasticity,
*  but as kind of like an umbrella idea of how we look at it,
*  that's often how we divide those two up.
*  So we kind of have these two molecules,
*  they end of the day do the same thing.
*  They're regulating neurotransmitter release
*  through retrograde signaling,
*  but what stimulation brings them online
*  or what drives their activity may differentiate.
*  And we don't really understand all the details behind that,
*  outside of the fact that we very clearly know
*  2AG is activity dependent.
*  So as that neuron becomes more active,
*  it's gonna make 2AG to regulate its inputs.
*  So yeah, you have this very complex system
*  and it's really widely distributed in,
*  it's everywhere.
*  There's a cannabinoid receptors
*  and the endocannabinoid molecules are in the cortex,
*  they're in the hypothalamus,
*  they're in the striatum, the hippocampus,
*  the cerebellum.
*  All over the brain.
*  Except the one area where it's really interesting actually,
*  where you don't really see much receptor
*  is in brainstem populations that regulate
*  kind of unconscious cardiac and respiratory function.
*  So this is one of the things
*  that really differentiates cannabis from opiates
*  because a lot of the signaling mechanisms
*  between opioid receptors and cannabinoid receptors
*  are quite similar.
*  But as it's been well established,
*  people can overdose and fatally and die
*  from opiates relatively easily.
*  And the way that that tends to happen is
*  when you activate the opiate receptors
*  in the kind of cardio respiratory parts of the brainstem,
*  it depresses neural activity.
*  So as the person loses consciousness,
*  they also unconsciously will stop regulating
*  their own heart and breathing
*  and it can be a fatal response.
*  Because cannabinoid receptors
*  don't really exist in those regions,
*  you don't get the same kind of impact
*  in terms of suppressing heart rate and breathing function.
*  And so that's, I mean,
*  you know, there's always the saying,
*  like there's never been an account of someone
*  actually dying from a cannabis overdose or a THC overdose.
*  I mean, certainly people can do stupid things
*  while they're intoxicated that result in their death,
*  but in the same manner that someone can die
*  from consuming too much opiates,
*  that doesn't seem to be physically possible
*  with cannabinoids as far as we've seen so far.
*  And a lot of that is just because of the localization.
*  Like for some reason,
*  it's just not the receptors in that part of the brain.
*  Very interesting.
*  A lot of kind of aficionado questions
*  about the receptor biology.
*  I'll just spare everyone the details
*  by just highlighting something that you already said
*  far more eloquently than I will,
*  which is I think it is fascinating
*  that this whole system has both a tonic,
*  like a steady release capability and a phasic,
*  so the ability to spike, forgive the pun,
*  the neuroscientists will know what I'm talking about,
*  to spike more activity of this system
*  superimposed on that tonic activity,
*  because this is something that you see
*  in the dopamine system.
*  This is something that you see
*  in essentially every neuromodulator, neurotransmitter system,
*  but it seems that the endocannabinoid system
*  has accomplished this quite a bit differently.
*  So very interesting, unique system
*  in a number of ways that raise a number of key questions.
*  So yeah, if you go back to the munchies question you had,
*  so if we tie into that, one of the,
*  so there's a few ways,
*  I mean cannabinoids and feeding
*  are a really interesting thing,
*  because proto, like if you ask people
*  like kind of the prototypical responses to consuming cannabis,
*  most people would usually say munchies
*  is one of the things that pops up pretty regularly.
*  And so, you know, the cannabinoid receptors are very,
*  they are expressed in these feeding circuits
*  in the hypothalamus, and you know,
*  there's a lot of complex circuitry there
*  that can regulate food seeking behavior.
*  Yeah, we just had an episode with Zach Knight
*  from HHMI and UCSF, we talked about like the AGRP neurons
*  and different neurons of the hypothalamus,
*  we can link to that in the show note captions.
*  Nowadays, a rich understanding of the neurons
*  that stimulate food seeking, craving, and eating.
*  And so we know that like cannabinoids,
*  they regulate again those inhibitory inputs
*  around AGRP neurons, for example,
*  and so one thing they can do
*  is disinhibit those AGRP neurons
*  so they become more active
*  and that can drive food seeking behavior.
*  So that's certainly one mechanism of it,
*  but there's also a huge reward component to this
*  in terms of the munchies.
*  And so we know that like you can also
*  just dump anandamide, for example,
*  this is, you know, Steve Mahler and Kent Barrett
*  did this work years ago,
*  where they just put anandamide into the nucleus accumbens
*  and that can also stimulate palatable food intake.
*  So you also have this ability to integrate
*  with the reward circuitry.
*  And then there was also this fascinating paper
*  from a Japanese group in PNAS, I think about 12 years ago,
*  and what they found was they would give a rodent a cannabinoid
*  and then they would stimulate
*  different taste bud populations.
*  And then they would look at the gustatory cortical response
*  to stimulating the populations.
*  And what they found is under the influence of a cannabinoid,
*  if you stimulated sweet taste buds,
*  you got an enhanced response in the gustatory cortex,
*  but not if you did salty, bitter, or sour,
*  or I don't know if they did umami in that one,
*  but it was very explicit to sweet tasting.
*  And so you have this kind of ability to like jack up
*  the way the brain is processing sweet tasting foods.
*  You have this engagement of the reward circuitry.
*  And then you also have this ability to regulate
*  AGRP neurons, as well as the palm C neurons,
*  those kind of both sides of that in the arcuate nucleus,
*  to regulate multiple components of feeding.
*  But a big question is like,
*  my lab has become kind of interested in this as well,
*  because we have a component of my lab
*  that studies feeding behavior.
*  And one of my post-docs has been doing these projects
*  for years now trying to understand,
*  almost like at a behavioral mechanism level,
*  what the munchies are.
*  And what she's been looking at is we kind of started thinking
*  about the idea that, you know, what is it that,
*  because it's not just food seeking
*  and it's not just, you know, like,
*  just want to consume something.
*  There's a maintenance of eating.
*  And so we know from humans and animals,
*  you can satiate them, you can make someone fall
*  and then get them high on cannabis
*  and they'll reinitiate eating.
*  So that's an interesting thing in and of itself,
*  because that means you're disrupting
*  either the ability of the brain to detect satiety
*  or you're messing with a process
*  we call reward devaluation.
*  And so reward devaluation is like, you know,
*  if you haven't eaten for a day
*  and you see like a picture of a pizza,
*  someone brings a pizza in front of you,
*  it just looks delicious.
*  That first slice tastes amazing.
*  It's salty, it's fatty, it's delicious.
*  You eat five of those slices, it feels greasy and nasty.
*  And so that process of how you perceive the food
*  and its reward salience degrades as you eat
*  and as your brain basically shifts into a thing of,
*  we don't need to consume calories and food anymore.
*  We're okay, we're full now.
*  And so we've done a series of experiments in the lab
*  where you'd get the animals and either satiated in advance
*  where they have already devalued the food
*  and under a normal state, they won't eat it anymore.
*  They won't work to get access to it.
*  And you get them high on like a cannabis extract.
*  We have these vape chambers that are like,
*  I don't know how else to describe it.
*  Outside of like a little hot box.
*  It's probably the best way to,
*  because it's essentially a kind of a locked airtight box
*  that the rat goes in and it gets like vapor puffs
*  and it fills up and then they inhale this
*  and then it clears out and they get another puff
*  and then it fills up.
*  And we do this for like 15 minutes.
*  And we've titrated all this to get exactly blood levels
*  of THC that you would achieve in someone who's,
*  consuming cannabis through smoking.
*  And so we get them to that point
*  and then give them access to food and they will,
*  go gangbusters.
*  They eat food, doesn't matter what you give them.
*  You give them plain chow, they go to town.
*  You give them fatty, you give them sweet.
*  They love it all.
*  But you presatiate them and they get them stoned.
*  They will reinitiate eating again.
*  And you make them work for it
*  where they have to like lever press.
*  And you get them stoned and they will go to town on that
*  and they will work.
*  Proof that even under the influence of cannabis,
*  animals will work hard.
*  Yeah, they, for food, I don't know about other stuff,
*  but for food, they certainly will.
*  I mean, at least Weiritz and Cassie Moore have done this
*  at Hopkins as well.
*  They've shown similarly using what we call
*  progressive ratio, which is essentially a thing
*  where it's like the first time you press a lever,
*  you immediately get a sugar.
*  Next time you gotta hit it twice to get a pellet.
*  Then you have to hit it four times to get one.
*  Yeah, then you gotta hit it 16
*  and then it kind of scales exponentially up.
*  I mean, we've had this one female,
*  we kind of joke about in the lab, this one female rat
*  and you get her high and she'll do like 300 lever presses
*  to get one sugar pellet.
*  Like she really wants it.
*  So you can really kind of goose up their motivation to eat.
*  And so there's clearly a rewarding aspect of this
*  because they're motivated to engage enough
*  in working to get access to the food.
*  But you can also do another way of testing this question,
*  which is you can pair a food with something
*  that will make the animal feel nauseous,
*  like lithium chloride.
*  This is kind of the way that you would test
*  condition taste aversion.
*  You give them access to a food
*  and then you give them something
*  that makes them feel nauseous
*  and the animals will avoid that food.
*  And so that's another way to kind of devalue a food
*  is by pairing it with a nauseant
*  so the animal no longer likes it.
*  So again, same situation, you can get the animal stoned
*  and it will reengage in eating that food
*  that it had devalued through being paired with a nauseant.
*  So through either satiety or making it
*  kind of a negative associated flavor
*  because the animal got nauseous before,
*  you can kind of override these effects by giving THC.
*  And so that could be a complex process
*  that either involves changes in the reward circuitry.
*  This could be something that's like
*  from the orbit of frontal cortex,
*  which is a very important part of the brain
*  that scales reward and kind of assesses
*  how much someone wants to work
*  or an organism wants to work to achieve a reward at the end.
*  So we haven't figured out the circuitry of this
*  and where exactly it's acting,
*  but I would say a lot of the stuff that we and others
*  have done kind of supports this idea
*  that a lot of what the munchies is,
*  is this ability to kind of almost lock in
*  the reward value of food so that it doesn't decay.
*  Despite satiety, despite eating over time,
*  it just keeps it highly salient
*  so that they wanna work for it still.
*  And then similarly, we've also,
*  we and others have also done work to show
*  we can block satiety signals.
*  So we know endocannabinoids at least
*  are capable of overriding leptin.
*  So leptin is an anorectic molecule,
*  comes out from the fat and usually we release it
*  when we've eaten a lot and it's one of these things
*  that tells our brain, stop eating.
*  Works through again, populations in the arcuate nucleus
*  and changes the way those neurons function
*  to drive food seeking behavior.
*  And we and others have shown previously
*  that if you elevate endocannabinoids, you can override that.
*  And actually one of the mechanisms by which leptin
*  seems to suppress feeding is actually by turning on
*  the metabolism of endocannabinoids
*  so that their levels decline.
*  And so as you lose that endocannabinoid function,
*  the animal is less interested in eating.
*  And so you can prevent these anorectic effects of leptin
*  by like goosing up endocannabinoid activity.
*  As many of you know, I've been taking AG1
*  for more than 10 years now.
*  So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring this podcast.
*  To be clear, I don't take AG1 because they're a sponsor,
*  rather they are a sponsor because I take AG1.
*  In fact, I take AG1 once and often twice every single day.
*  And I've done that since starting way back in 2012.
*  There is so much conflicting information out there nowadays
*  about what proper nutrition is.
*  But here's what there seems to be a general consensus on.
*  Whether you're an omnivore, a carnivore,
*  a vegetarian or a vegan,
*  I think it's generally agreed that you should get most
*  of your food from unprocessed or minimally processed sources,
*  which allows you to eat enough, but not overeat,
*  get plenty of vitamins and minerals, probiotics
*  and micronutrients that we all need
*  for physical and mental health.
*  Now, I personally am an omnivore and I strive to get most
*  of my food from unprocessed or minimally processed sources.
*  But the reason I still take AG1 once
*  and often twice every day is that it ensures I get all
*  of those vitamins, minerals, probiotics, et cetera.
*  But it also has adaptogens to help me cope with stress.
*  It's basically a nutritional insurance policy meant
*  to augment, not replace quality food.
*  So by drinking a serving of AG1 in the morning
*  and again in the afternoon or evening,
*  I cover all of my foundational nutritional needs.
*  And I, like so many other people that take AG1,
*  report feeling much better in a number of important ways,
*  such as energy levels, digestion, sleep and more.
*  So while many supplements out there are really directed
*  towards obtaining one specific outcome,
*  AG1 is foundational nutrition designed
*  to support all aspects of wellbeing related
*  to mental health and physical health.
*  If you'd like to try AG1, you can go to drinkag1.com
*  slash Huberman to claim a special offer.
*  They'll give you five free travel packs with your order
*  plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
*  Again, that's drinkag1.com slash Huberman.
*  You're talking about increasing endocannabinoid activity.
*  And we've said all this in the context of cannabis.
*  So maybe we could talk a little bit about
*  how the components in cannabis, THC mainly,
*  but also CBD impact these receptors, the CB1.
*  And let's just leave CB2 out for the moment
*  because it sounds like it's more of an immune system thing.
*  But just to make it very clear,
*  is there a way to increase the activity of endocannabinoids
*  without ingesting THC?
*  Yes, I mean, they dynamically change all the time.
*  But you're talking about,
*  you're talking about experimentally or recreationally
*  adjusting their levels, but how does one do that
*  without using THC?
*  So, okay, few things there, we'll take a step back.
*  So THC itself isn't going to,
*  it does its thing by acting directly
*  on the cannabinoid receptor.
*  So it sort of mimics the anandamide and 2-AG.
*  Yeah, so THC, going back to kind of the pharmacology of this.
*  So THC, if you look at how it interacts with the receptor,
*  it's not a heavy duty molecule.
*  So, I mean, this was kind of one of the things
*  that came up before as well,
*  is this idea that THC is a sledgehammer
*  and it overrides endocannabinoids.
*  By the way, Matt's referring to the fact that I said that
*  in a previous solo episode about this.
*  And there I was nesting it in the concentrations of THC
*  that can be found in high THC cannabis.
*  So essentially what I was saying is that
*  at very high THC concentrations,
*  the amount, maybe not the binding affinity,
*  but the amount of THC that is available to the CB1 receptors
*  is going to exceed what's normally found
*  in terms of the amount of anandamide
*  that can bind to CB1 receptors.
*  Because what you're talking about
*  is a super physiological condition.
*  I mean, you don't really actually need much THC
*  in the brain to produce psychoactivity.
*  It's a little bit of a mystery,
*  to be honest, exactly how it works.
*  I mean, I think the main way that most people
*  in the cannabinoid theory field would look at this
*  is that THC is not like a very strong agonist.
*  I mean, even if you look at its ability
*  to trigger an intracellular response,
*  it's much lower than 2AG.
*  It's actually more like anandamide.
*  So you said anandamide is high affinity, low efficacy.
*  Yeah, so THC is the same.
*  THC is actually only a partial agonist.
*  It's not even a full agonist at CB1.
*  But it is high affinity.
*  It's high affinity.
*  So it has the ability.
*  But the tricky thing with that is it can outcompete 2AG,
*  but because it's a lower efficacy agonist than 2AG,
*  in that sense, it's almost blocking the effects,
*  not amplifying them.
*  Blocking the effects of 2AG,
*  but does it block the effects of anandamide?
*  THC and anandamide, the way I would visualize it
*  is because they seem to have relatively similar affinities
*  and efficacies of the receptor,
*  they might, let's say, dance around.
*  So it would be somewhat interchangeable.
*  The difference there is,
*  and this I think is the big point about what THC does
*  versus endocannabinoids,
*  because we know now through the pharmaceutical development
*  of drugs that can boost anandamide levels, which exist,
*  we have inhibitors that prevent their metabolism,
*  we can elevate them.
*  There's no intoxication and no psychoactivity
*  associated with elevating anandamide.
*  That's a very interesting point that we should highlight.
*  So there are drugs that now exist
*  that can block the breakdown of anandamide,
*  presumably by disrupting some enzymatic breakdown,
*  and therefore lead to more binding
*  of the now elevated levels of anandamide
*  that are available to CB1,
*  and you see no psychoactive effect.
*  People are not aware that they've been.
*  Yeah, you can do, no one can guess.
*  What is it used for?
*  Well, I mean, it was developed,
*  the first molecule really was developed by Pfizer
*  to look at if it could work on pain.
*  The first trial that was done did not work.
*  It was like a kind of strange osteoarthritic knee pain trial
*  that was like, even in that trial,
*  the positive control of naproxen barely worked,
*  but because the Fah inhibitor, which is,
*  take a step back, Fah's the enzyme
*  that chews up anandamide.
*  So the drug that is developed inhibits that enzyme.
*  So you prevent the enzymatic breakdown of anandamide.
*  So we just call them Fah inhibitors.
*  So this drug will boost anandamide levels quite high,
*  and an animal research showed some efficacy
*  in modulating pain.
*  And so they put it in a trial and it didn't work
*  against the positive control of naproxen,
*  which is like an NSAID, just like Advil basically.
*  A leave. Yeah, essentially, yeah.
*  So, and that drug didn't work that great to begin with.
*  So it was maybe some issues with the trial,
*  but it essentially killed the development of the drug
*  from that point on, because everyone's like,
*  oh, it's not gonna work.
*  So it kind of shelved for a while.
*  A colleague of mine, Marcus Heilig and Leah Mayo,
*  Leah's now a colleague of mine in Calgary,
*  but at the time she was a postdoc with Marcus in Sweden,
*  and they were able to get access to this molecule
*  right before COVID essentially.
*  And they did a trial in just healthy controls with it,
*  which again, this is kind of jumping the gun
*  on some of their stuff I'll talk about.
*  So I'll tether back to that.
*  But what they did was they dosed people for 10 days
*  on this drug, and then we looked at stress and fear,
*  because this is something that I study.
*  This is something that they were interested in.
*  And we did find that boosting anandamide with this drug
*  over 10 days was sufficiently capable
*  of dampening stress-induced autonomic responses.
*  So like looking at heart rate or skin conductance.
*  I think skin conductance was the measure we did in there,
*  but it's a proxy for like adrenaline release.
*  So it blunted that,
*  and it blunted subjective feelings of stress as well.
*  So people had lower levels of seeing
*  that actually felt stressed.
*  And it kind of helped remove this like conditioned fear
*  memory that they had trained people to do.
*  And so I worked with them on kind of doing
*  the biochemistry of this to make sure
*  the drug was working properly.
*  But it was very interesting because we did see
*  in that situation where elevating anandamide produced
*  kind of like a reduction in stress perception,
*  a reduction in stress physiology responses,
*  and kind of help kind of reduce fear.
*  And so that is kind of an interesting outcome
*  because it tracks with some of the stuff
*  we know about cannabis.
*  And I'm sure we'll talk about some of the PTSD stuff
*  and anxiety later.
*  But so that's kind of one of the things.
*  The drug has not really been used that widely yet.
*  It's still, it's one of the frustrations I have
*  as a scientist who does a lot of translational work
*  and with clinical partners like Leah,
*  is that getting access to these molecules is not easy
*  when they're not kind of wide,
*  they're not like out in the market.
*  So you can just go and get them.
*  You really have to try and get access
*  from the drug companies to be able to do trials with them.
*  And so we are in the midst of trying to do that.
*  We did just complete a trial that Leah and Marcus ran
*  that I worked with them on as well that was on PTSD.
*  And so there are various potential indications for this.
*  I mean, Johnson and Johnson developed one as well
*  and they looked at it in social anxiety disorder.
*  They had some moderate efficacy in their trial.
*  So I'd say the jury's still out on exactly
*  what we're gonna do with these,
*  but they have some potential,
*  I think in certain clinical settings,
*  we just have to figure that out exactly.
*  But I think going back to where we started this from,
*  they're not psychoactive.
*  And so, I mean, when Pfizer first made the drug,
*  they were actually initially concerned
*  that it wasn't getting in the brain
*  because no one could tell they were on the drug.
*  I mean, this was the Wild West at this point.
*  No one had any idea what endocannabinoids
*  were actually gonna do.
*  People were basing it on what we knew about THC.
*  So the assumption was people would have psychoactivity,
*  but they didn't.
*  Pfizer then actually had to do,
*  they did a sleep study to show that it did have some effects
*  on sleep cycle the same way THC does.
*  And then they also did like an in vivo pet binding study
*  to show that they could displace a radioactive molecule
*  that would bind to the enzyme in the brain.
*  Seems like a lot of gymnastics to basically confirm
*  what they already knew,
*  which is that even greatly elevating the anandamide
*  by blocking this enzymatic breakdown of anandamide
*  leads to, at least from what I'm understanding,
*  vastly different subjective experience
*  than ingesting or smoking THC.
*  Which brings us back to THC and cannabis.
*  Like, you know, it seems that this thing
*  that we call cannabis and THC are overlapping
*  with the endogenous effects of anandamide,
*  but here you're not talking about endogenous normal levels.
*  You're talking about pharmacologically
*  greatly increasing anandamide.
*  No psychoactive effect, no euphoria,
*  no munchies, et cetera.
*  Then people smoke or take an edible of THC or cannabis,
*  and you get a vastly different set of effects.
*  So maybe we could talk about THC and the CB1 receptor.
*  And since we're here, we might as well talk about CBD
*  and the, I think you're gonna tell us,
*  the lack of interaction with CB1 receptor, right?
*  And what is cannabis doing at the level of these receptors?
*  Because it makes me wonder whether or not
*  these receptors are the whole story
*  or whether or not cannabis is, as you mentioned,
*  70 plus active molecules in there,
*  terpenes and a bunch of other things
*  that may modify their action,
*  that this thing we call cannabis has many more actions
*  than just mimicking the endogenous cannabinoid system.
*  Yeah, I mean, I think, I would say the main way
*  that we think about this is the difference
*  between endocannabinoids and THC is endocannabinoids
*  are gonna be released in a very specific
*  spatial and temporal manner.
*  So-
*  They evolved to do that.
*  Yeah, so there's gonna be, and I think like,
*  it's very clear that like anandamide, for example,
*  is not active at every synapse that has CB1.
*  And so when we boost anandamide signaling
*  by inhibiting its metabolism,
*  all we're doing is amplifying anandamide signaling
*  at the synapses that already exists.
*  Whereas THC, when you consume it orally or inhalation-wise
*  and it gets into your blood and into your brain,
*  it's just blanket activation.
*  You're just carpet bombing the whole system indiscriminately.
*  And so-
*  You're introducing the ligand,
*  the thing that binds the receptor.
*  This is far and away different than, say,
*  like the actions of amphetamines,
*  which are disrupting the normal biology
*  in a way that's giving you an amplification
*  of an endogenous mechanism.
*  Yes. Right?
*  If that was all just nerd speak for those listening.
*  It's one, in the context of amphetamines,
*  what you're doing is you're taking an endogenous system,
*  a naturally occurring system,
*  and you're greatly amplifying the amount of dopamine,
*  the amount of norepinephrine that's available.
*  With what we're discussing today,
*  the endocannabinoid system seems to be producing
*  a set of effects that might overlap with the THC effects,
*  but THC is doing a bunch of other things.
*  And that's because THC, and we'll talk about CBD,
*  but at least THC is acting as the ligand.
*  It's in some sense, we don't want to say replacing,
*  but it's masking the effects of anandamide.
*  I think the problem is when you just blanket activate
*  all the CB1 receptors in the brain indiscriminately,
*  like you do when you consume cannabis with THC,
*  the resulting effect is the intoxicating state.
*  And it's probably because there's a lot of CB1 receptors
*  in the cortex, and those are going to be
*  differentially regulated at different times
*  by endocannabinoids, whereas when THC hits them,
*  all of them are going to get affected at once.
*  And if you think of the way that I had described
*  how cannabinoid receptors work by,
*  essentially, I mean, in its simplest form,
*  what cannabinoid receptors do is they change the way
*  that two neurons talk to each other.
*  And so-
*  So you're changing all the networks simultaneously.
*  Yeah, so if you hit a whole bunch of networks
*  simultaneously, you're just going to change the way
*  that information processing and perception occurs.
*  And I think as a consequence of that,
*  that's what produces the intoxicating state.
*  Not that THC is like a super duper version
*  of an endocannabinoid, or that it's boosting endocannabinoids.
*  It's kind of like just indiscriminately activating
*  all the receptors as opposed to a system
*  that's very finely tuned to do very specific things
*  at very specific times.
*  That's very helpful.
*  So the analogy that I was considering using coming in here,
*  like the difference between endogenous testosterone
*  or estrogen versus pharmacologic testosterone or estrogen
*  given as a therapy is very different
*  because that's a levels issue.
*  This is a levels and an extent issue.
*  Yeah, this is a lot more to do with just, yeah,
*  the nature of how it hits everything.
*  Because, like, so for example, if we talk about feeding,
*  we know it's been established at this point that,
*  for example, if an organism doesn't eat for like a day,
*  so you've fasted.
*  At that point, in those feeding circuits in your brain,
*  like the arcuate area where these AGRP neurons and stuff are,
*  you'll start seeing elevations in endocannabinoids.
*  So endocannabinoid levels start kind of going up and up
*  following kind of fasting periods.
*  And part of this is because they're trying to engage
*  that feeding circuitry now,
*  and they're shifting the activity of those neurons
*  to promote food-seeking behavior.
*  Because an organism is basically like energy detecting
*  its periphery and saying, oh, you know,
*  we might be burning through our energy reserves,
*  we should probably eat more.
*  And so there are obviously a few mechanisms that do this.
*  NPY is another one, and ghrelin and things like that.
*  So there's a lot of redundancy in these systems,
*  but endocannabinoids are just one of the molecules
*  that seem to fine tune, like, the feeding circuitry.
*  And so in states of fasting,
*  endocannabinoids go up explicitly in that circuit.
*  And there's some evidence they also go up
*  in like the nucleus accumbens
*  and affect some of the reward circuitries.
*  They're probably driving food-seeking behavior
*  and enhancing the rewarding aspects of food at the same time.
*  And so that's like a natural endogenous mechanism
*  to regulate feeding based on nutritional state.
*  THC, on the other hand, you know, it hits the brain.
*  Yeah, some of it's gonna be the intoxication,
*  but in tandem, you're gonna hit the CB1 receptors
*  that are in those feeding circuits as well.
*  And the consequence of that is gonna be,
*  I mean, the way I kind of analogize it to people is I say,
*  it's almost like tricking the brain
*  into thinking that you've been fasting.
*  Because you're now activating receptors
*  that are normally activated following kind of a fasting state.
*  And as a consequence of that,
*  it pushes someone or an organism or human or whatever
*  into a state of food-seeking behavior,
*  because now food also has high reward value
*  and they're kind of,
*  the way that their food circuitry is responding
*  in the brain at least seems to be similar
*  to what would happen if they've been fasted.
*  And the thought is that's why when people,
*  you know, when someone gets stoned,
*  they're not like going to eat lettuce.
*  They want high calorie food.
*  They tend to like things that are high carb, high fat.
*  That combo seems to be what people like
*  when they're intoxicated with cannabis.
*  And that comes with a lot of calories.
*  And the point of that would be you're trying
*  to replenish lost energy stores.
*  And so this at least is the kind of the theory that I have
*  about what it is that it's doing is, you know,
*  and I think you can make this analogy
*  for multiple different things.
*  You know, if we talk about pain or stress,
*  we can say similar kinds of things are going on,
*  is that endocannabinoids normally do one thing,
*  but when THC hits the brain,
*  it's still activating these circuits
*  in addition to everything else that hits.
*  So you still drive that response
*  that the endocannabinoid system
*  normally physiologically controls,
*  but you're almost like tricking the brain
*  into thinking you're in that state now.
*  And so then you, then yeah,
*  you go into food seeking behavior mode.
*  Super interesting.
*  Well, I have to imagine that there are many people
*  who use cannabis not to stimulate appetite,
*  but for other reasons.
*  They either like the euphoria or to adjust their anxiety.
*  What are some other known mechanisms
*  by which cannabis can change people's psychology?
*  Let me focus in on one particular aspect
*  of subjective experience, which is focus.
*  Do you think that some people use cannabis
*  because it allows them to focus better?
*  And I raise this specifically because I think that
*  in the past, cannabis has had a bit of a reputation
*  for making people spacey,
*  now you use the word stoned, kind of out of it.
*  And yet I've heard of some potential uses
*  for enhancing focus.
*  I mean, honestly, this is a bit of a tricky one to speak to
*  because I just don't think there's good evidence for it.
*  Either way or?
*  I just don't, I mean, as far as I'm aware,
*  it hasn't been studied in a lot of depth.
*  I mean, there's some things,
*  a lot of the stuff that's been done is usually more like
*  kind of acute memory tasks, like a working memory
*  or recall or something like this,
*  as opposed to explicitly studying focus.
*  Anecdotally, there is certainly a lot of people
*  that report that.
*  My understanding is that people who use cannabis
*  have poorer certain forms of memory,
*  but not necessarily poorer memory across the board.
*  Is that correct?
*  I don't think I would say that.
*  I don't think you could lump anything in that context.
*  I mean, I would say the only thing you can say confidently
*  that I would be comfortable saying is that acutely,
*  while someone's intoxicated on cannabis,
*  there is definitely short-term effects on memory processing.
*  So people tend to-
*  Negative effects or enhancements or decrements?
*  I would say most of it has to do with recall
*  or consolidation.
*  So there does seem to be some,
*  I mean, certainly the animal evidence
*  is very compelling there,
*  but again, we can talk to what some of the limitations
*  of that are.
*  But in humans, I would say most of the work
*  that's been done would suggest there is some
*  short-term memory deficits that are present
*  during the intoxicated state.
*  I have not seen very much compelling evidence
*  of long-term effects that emerge,
*  like when someone's not intoxicated,
*  but they use cannabis somewhat regularly.
*  I don't think there's anything compelling for that.
*  And even in that case, like Kerry Cutler,
*  who's at Washington State,
*  she's done a lot of this stuff looking at
*  cognitive processing and different kinds of memory tasks
*  in users while they're stoned often.
*  And within a person, either they have adapted to using it
*  as much as they do,
*  or they've developed some form of tolerance to it,
*  but even in regular users,
*  the impact on memory processing is usually not super robust.
*  It's still there.
*  I think the effects that are more often seen
*  in kind of, let's say, smaller laboratory studies
*  where they're using people who've used cannabis
*  but aren't regular users might be a little bit more profound
*  because they may not be used to that state, let's say.
*  I mean, there's certainly something
*  we call state-dependent learning,
*  which I'm sure you're familiar with.
*  And this is something people,
*  I mean, I remember learning about this
*  in undergrad through alcohol.
*  So like, someone, first time they get drunk
*  tries doing something, they're very bad at the task.
*  But if every time they're drunk, they do that task,
*  they become better at doing it under the influence.
*  And so then all of a sudden,
*  they regularly do this task while they're drunk
*  and someone tests them,
*  and they don't look like they're impaired at all
*  because they've done it so much.
*  And so-
*  I should just say, this point has often been confused
*  by undergraduates and others to assume that
*  just because one can gain proficiency at a task
*  while under the influence of a substance
*  does not mean that you have higher proficiency
*  at that particular task while under the influence.
*  In fact, the way it was presented to me
*  when I was an undergraduate was incorrect.
*  I remember the lecturer said and later corrected himself,
*  I won't call him out here because that's unfair.
*  He's not here to defend himself,
*  but it happens in lectures,
*  that people who studied drunk would be better off
*  coming to the exam drunk.
*  That is not true from what I understand.
*  I don't think better off, no.
*  But they would probably score better than someone
*  who had never studied drunk and came to the test drunk.
*  Just because they had had some state dependent learning.
*  And so I think when we're talking about,
*  if you're talking about someone
*  who's a chronic cannabis user,
*  they're going to have done a lot of cognitive tasks
*  while they're under the influence.
*  And so if you acutely test them,
*  the impairment you might see in them is probably less
*  than you would see in someone who's relatively naive
*  or a much less experienced user.
*  That being said, I think it's relatively well established.
*  Most people would agree that acutely intoxication
*  with cannabis does impair memory processes in some capacity.
*  What explicit form of memory?
*  I don't think I could speak to comfortably
*  just because I'm not a memory researcher
*  and I know there's very specific things
*  of like episodic and declarative and whatnot.
*  So I can't say that, but I'd say it's kind of generally,
*  and I mean, again, you can replicate this in animals
*  where if you train them on a task
*  while they're under the influence,
*  they don't seem to have consolidated
*  that information as well.
*  But again, I don't really think
*  there's super compelling evidence
*  that there's kind of long-term permanent effects
*  on cognitive function in individuals who use cannabis.
*  At least I've never seen anything that's replicable
*  or reliable or stable in any way.
*  So yeah.
*  Thanks for clarifying that.
*  And also thank you for clarifying the discrepancy
*  between endogenous cannabinoid binding
*  and affinity for CB1 versus THC.
*  I really appreciate that because that's something
*  that you and I discussed in light of the solo episode
*  I did about cannabis.
*  And now you've made it clear that THC does not bind
*  with much higher affinity.
*  I think your words were it,
*  assuming high THC levels in the cannabis,
*  carpet bombs all the networks as opposed to binding more
*  with higher affinity at particular receptors.
*  Yeah, I mean, I don't actually even think it matters
*  if it's high THC in the cannabis.
*  I think like some people can get very intoxicated
*  off of very, very low doses of cannabis.
*  Is that right?
*  I mean, you look at edibles, for example.
*  I mean, this may be an interesting segue
*  into root of administration stuff
*  because I think it's an important point
*  that a lot of people don't recognize
*  is the difference between someone inhaling cannabis
*  versus someone orally consuming cannabis
*  is like a different game.
*  Yeah, let's talk about this.
*  Cause I know that you and I arrived
*  at different understanding of the fastest,
*  typical and slowest routes of entry for THC
*  into the system to arrive at the brain, right?
*  The numbers that I gave in the previous discussion
*  about this were related to how quickly inhaled smoke moves
*  from the lungs to the bloodstream
*  and crosses the blood brain barrier.
*  Which is very fast.
*  Right, which is very fast.
*  I don't know if it's different than nicotine.
*  I'm not sure.
*  Again, I don't know if I would say that,
*  but yeah, it's very fast.
*  Okay, so there may be,
*  it may be that it is the same as nicotine.
*  It may be that it's faster,
*  but importantly it can be fast.
*  But typically how fast is the onset
*  of the subjective experience of,
*  okay, somebody takes a hit off a joint or a bong hit
*  and they start to experience the subjective effects
*  of euphoria, et cetera.
*  How quickly after?
*  Two to five minutes, I would say.
*  It's pretty fast.
*  I mean, so this is one of the things with cannabis is,
*  and again, this will kind of go into this idea
*  of the change in potency of the plant as well.
*  It's pretty quick
*  and people titrate cannabis pretty well.
*  At least people who've used it a couple of times
*  and understand this.
*  And I've seen some people not titrate it very well.
*  Depending again on how you, so again, this can vary.
*  So cannabis from the 70s was like, I don't know,
*  5% THC, let's say.
*  It was pretty low.
*  And nowadays cannabis is,
*  a lot of the commercial stuff is between 20 and 30,
*  although whether those are super accurate numbers,
*  not entirely clear, but so it's gone up a fair amount.
*  Yeah, I mean, that's not just a fair amount.
*  I mean, if we were talking about alcohol concentration.
*  It's beer to vodka.
*  Yeah, basically you're talking about a beer
*  or a wine to a spirit.
*  And there are aquavit varieties, so to speak.
*  By the way, I think when people hear me talk about
*  any kind of drug that can be used recreationally or alcohol,
*  I think some people assume that,
*  I'm ultra anti all these things.
*  I'm actually not, right?
*  I'm not an alcoholic, so I can drink a little bit
*  and I have, I just don't tend to.
*  And we could discuss cannabis in a different venue.
*  But the point here is,
*  we're not trying to frame this as
*  what people should or shouldn't do.
*  We're just trying to inform people.
*  I wanna be very, very clear about that.
*  So, but when I hear about, you know,
*  20 to 30% concentration as opposed to, you know,
*  5% concentration, it's significant.
*  So I would say, this is what's super interesting.
*  And this was something that came out of,
*  the way that cannabis research is done,
*  certainly in the States.
*  Canada's been quite behind on this,
*  even with legalization, we haven't caught up.
*  But they have been doing lab-based studies of cannabis.
*  You know, Meg Haney, Harriet DeWitt,
*  there's a cluster of researchers around the country,
*  Ziva Cooper at UCLA here, have all done this where,
*  you know, you have people come into the lab,
*  you give them cannabis, you measure subjective outcomes
*  or neuroimaging outcomes or whatnot.
*  So to do this, you can't use commercial cannabis.
*  And pretty even like the state by state legalizations
*  hasn't changed this.
*  So if you are doing cannabis research in humans
*  and you're funded by like NIDA,
*  which is National Institute of Drug Abuse,
*  you get all your cannabis sourced.
*  I mean, this may be changing.
*  I think there are some shifts that are happening,
*  but historically and all the literature
*  that we would talk about,
*  that's kind of pre the last couple of years,
*  all that cannabis came from one source,
*  which was, I believe a farm in like Mississippi
*  that was essentially funded by NIDA to produce cannabis.
*  Lucky farm.
*  And well, the cannabis that came out of it though,
*  and this is one of the reasons a lot
*  of the clinical stuff people have kind of been like,
*  oh, I don't know how representative this is
*  because it reflects cannabis that I would say
*  is more from like the seventies or eighties.
*  So it would be like five to 9% kind of THC cannabis.
*  Now, when you put someone in a lab setting
*  and you get them to smoke to level of intoxication,
*  people would take, whatever eight tokes, let's say,
*  something like that.
*  And that's where they would stop.
*  And so, a lot of the labs that use this
*  have always been like,
*  our people who are regular cannabis users
*  are getting high off of it.
*  It's not as potent as the stuff that's on the street,
*  but they're clearly getting intoxicated from it
*  and it's giving us reliable data.
*  So when they started looking at the blood levels of THC
*  that you achieve,
*  it was around a hundred nanograms per mil of THC,
*  give or take.
*  That seemed to be where it was.
*  Now, because of the way that the,
*  you can legally study cannabis in the States,
*  you couldn't just go down to a dispensary
*  and buy the products that everyone on the street are using,
*  which is kind of like,
*  it's been a weird thing for a lot of people
*  because they're like,
*  why wouldn't you study what we're using?
*  But because of the legal aspects of this,
*  you couldn't bring those products into the lab.
*  They'd never been standardized.
*  No one knew exactly what was in them, pesticides,
*  all this other stuff that could influence it.
*  So from a safety perspective,
*  it was always like, no,
*  you use the cannabis that's sourced from NIDA.
*  So there's a group in Colorado,
*  Kent Hutchinson and Angela Bryan and Cinnamon Bidwell
*  have kind of, I would say,
*  became very creative actually,
*  to figure out how to study cannabis
*  that's being used, I call it, in the wild,
*  in kind of an ecological setting, let's say.
*  And so they created what was called the Canavan.
*  And the Canavan was a way to study people
*  using products on the street,
*  but not have them come into a laboratory setting
*  where it was complicated.
*  So what they would do is they would drive the Canavan
*  to someone's house, but they'd be parked on the street,
*  and someone would use the product, whatever it was,
*  in their own property, in their own time,
*  and then come into the Canavan to have blood taken,
*  to look at what their THC levels are,
*  and to undergo testing.
*  And so it was actually like,
*  I think this was a great advance in the field,
*  because it was this huge innovative approach
*  that allowed us to start comparing
*  what we've learned from lab-based settings
*  with this kind of old school weed
*  that was coming from NIDA
*  with what is being used on the street.
*  I love this.
*  I mean, as somebody whose lab has done
*  in-laboratory VR-based experiment
*  on human anxiety and fear,
*  and then compared that to a clinical study
*  that we did sort of in mass,
*  where people were at home
*  doing specific respiration practices.
*  You have many more subjects,
*  but of course they're reporting back their effects.
*  Well, you can monitor them by device,
*  look at HRV, look at hardware, et cetera.
*  I think having the ability to compare and contrast
*  in-laboratory and ex-laboratory data is extremely valuable.
*  And I mean, my view is you need both,
*  because you need the in-laboratory for the control,
*  because we all need control over various things,
*  but you also need the ecological validity
*  to see how it shakes out and make sure it looks the same.
*  Yeah, for people that have never been to a laboratory
*  or tried to find a parking spot at a university,
*  that's an anxiety-inducing experience in and of itself.
*  A novel experience,
*  while someone's intoxicated with cannabis,
*  can also create a very different altered state.
*  I would want to be stoned in a laboratory.
*  I feel like there's pluses and minuses to both sides,
*  but I think the data together is very compelling,
*  and that's where we get a lot of advance in the field.
*  So what Kent and Angela and Cinnamon did with the Canavan
*  was kind of create the situation
*  that allowed this research to occur.
*  And what we found fascinating,
*  I remember talking to Meg Haney about this,
*  because all the people in her lab said
*  he's tended to always hit around 100 nanograms per mil
*  using this relatively lower-potency cannabis.
*  When Kent and Angela and Cinnamon
*  started studying this in the people
*  and taking blood,
*  despite the fact that these people are now using cannabis
*  that's 20 to 30%, their blood levels are the same.
*  So they're still coming in around 100 nanograms per mil,
*  because people are really good at self-titrating.
*  Now, where things fall apart is with the concentrates.
*  So then you go into things like dabs
*  or these high-potency products that are now like,
*  because cannabis itself, realistically,
*  from what I understand from the botanists
*  that I've talked to, you can't really grow a plant
*  that's gonna exceed more than 25 to 30% THC
*  just by sheer biology.
*  So it taps out there.
*  That's about as high as it's gonna go.
*  Concentrates can go up to like 90, 98%.
*  So you can get really, really-
*  These are tinctures?
*  Distalates, like yeah, various just in oil-based forms
*  that are very, very high-potency products.
*  Those are incredibly challenging to titrate.
*  They cannot be titrated,
*  because the sheer volume of THC that hits the system,
*  even from a single hit, is so overwhelming.
*  And so when the Colorado group looked at those,
*  their blood levels were closer to 200, 300 nanograms per mil.
*  So with cannabis plant, there does seem to be this ability
*  for people to relatively self-titrate.
*  And then my buddy Ryan McLaughlin,
*  who's also at Washington State,
*  he was really one of the ones
*  that pioneered these vape chambers in rats
*  and created this really cool model of self-administration,
*  which was like a very important thing
*  to actually establish, because it was very challenging
*  to get rodents to self-administer cannabis.
*  I'm not sure if you're doing an IV approach
*  or something else because they found it quite aversive,
*  but when you let rodents actually titer
*  their ability to get vape hits, they will work for this,
*  the same way they will other reinforcing drugs.
*  So it was a really important finding that you could do this.
*  And what Ryan found was he actually did one study
*  where he gave them access to a low-potency product,
*  we'll call it medium, and then a high.
*  And what you ended up, if you look at the data,
*  is the one that rats like the best
*  And if you gave them the high-potency product, they would actually take less vape hits off that than they would off the lower ones
*  and again all their blood levels tended to cluster in the same range because
*  they
*  titrated like even at the at the rodent level they're able to titrate because of the lag between inhalation and
*  Feeling the effects is only on the order of a couple of minutes people can titrate better
*  I mean not just people it seems like the rodents can as well
*  The higher potency cannabis where it becomes a problem is if someone's highly inexperienced and they consume a whole bunch of it without allowing
*  That time lag to occur
*  And then they can probably exceed the levels they intended to and consume too much and then have a probably an adverse response
*  So does that mean that cannabis use rarely leads to tolerance of cannabis use? I?
*  Wouldn't say that there's definitely some degree of tolerance the tolerance is definitely more prominent when people start using concentrates
*  There's no question about that
*  I mean we can talk about the concentrates I guess separately after because I would say if we're talking about a harm reduction thing
*  That's that's more where we need to focus a lot more is this idea of these high-potency products
*  Yeah, it sounds like those are precarious
*  Yeah, that's somebody who thinks they have a lot of experience or god forbid no experience takes a concentrate and is what no longer?
*  Getting the euphoric experience that they anticipated
*  But instead are getting what a paranoid anxiety attack
*  I think I think you're far more likely to go overboard and have an adverse response
*  But also I think the problem is if you're using a product of that
*  Potency and that much THC floods your system on a regular basis the biological changes from that are gonna be very different
*  Then what you get if again you're titrating your your THC from
*  inhaling plant at roughly the same level whether that's a 10% 5% or 25%
*  People generally tend to scale this is a very important point and I'm gonna highlight it because I think it's it's very
*  Very very important. Although you're making it very clearly already
*  Which is these days we hear a lot about the quote-unquote problems with high THC
*  containing cannabis as relative to what was
*  Present in the 70s and 80s and presumably 90s as well. Yeah, I mean I was a teen in the 90s
*  So maybe I'm alluding to something there. But what you're saying is that unless
*  One is talking about concentrates that people and animals in the laboratory will self regulate the amount of intake
*  In a way that leads to approximately the same blood levels of THC
*  So it may not be as much of a concern at least in light of yeah the concerns about oh these levels are so high
*  That people are overwhelming their system with THC
*  Basically, this could be stated in real-world terms as people are taking fewer tokes
*  Of the higher concentration stuff that allow them to match blood levels that were present in the person taking many more tokes
*  Yeah the 70s
*  So the joke I always make to people as they say go watch a Cheech and Chong movie from the late 70s
*  Look at the size of the joints that they smoke in movies like that relative to what you would see someone on the street consuming
*  nowadays like
*  It's just I mean so the advantage that existed from a titration perspective was with like 70s weed
*  There's a large window to titrate so people could you know take small amounts and not over consume
*  Let's say because there was a much lower concentration of THC in the plant
*  So they're able to consume you know, even if they were doing it relatively fast
*  Because of how little THC was coming into the system. It was a little easier to scale that
*  So there certainly is the propensity for people to over consume
*  higher potency cannabis even independent of
*  Concentrates if they're not allowing that titration to occur also if you have someone who is just
*  exquisitely sensitive to THC for various reasons
*  Even one or two tokes could be too much for them because at the higher potency
*  They they may not have that ability to titrate quite as well. And so a lot of people
*  Anecdotally you talk to people about cannabis and a lot of people who don't like cannabis have said
*  Oh, you know, I've tried the new stuff's too strong
*  And if there's someone who's kind of more in our age range who grew up in an earlier decade where things were a bit different
*  They may be referencing their own experience from when they were younger and what they were able to consume and now they try doing the
*  Same and it hits them like a sledgehammer. So it's a little different in that sense
*  But you know, and I don't think it's to say it's like not concerning that cannabis is as high as THC as it is
*  I just think if I'm gonna put my efforts into kind of like, you know public health perspectives of this
*  I would be digging my feet in much more about the access to
*  Concentrates and the issues and the potential harms that are gonna come with them than I would about the cannabis flower myself
*  that's just my opinion based on what I see with the concerns and what we've seen from the data and humans and I think the
*  the real world to call it ecological studies that the Colorado group have done have been very informative in this sense because
*  Yeah
*  If the if the blood levels of THC you achieve from concentrates are double to triple of what you get even from higher potency flower
*  That's a concern like I think that's where problems start arising because then you're gonna start seeing a lot higher degree of tolerance
*  I mean there used to be more of a debate in the field as to whether people develop tolerance because
*  One of the things with cannabis that I do find very interesting is with a lot of chronic users
*  They don't escalate the way you would see with cocaine or alcohol where there's very profound tolerance that develops and so I mean
*  People definitely see this in cocaine where people can become
*  Tolerant almost immediately and so dosing starts scaling up very fast
*  Usually it's the life destruction that that thwarts their yeah progressive increase
*  I mean the sheer cause another form of life life life deterioration. Yeah, that is required to be able to maintain that but with cannabis
*  It seems like there is some degree of tolerance that people exhibit it varies from person to person
*  But you know as like I've you know as Meg has said to me many times, you know
*  The guys that come in her studies these are very heavy users and then you know
*  They will use this relatively low potency product and still get high off of it
*  And so it's not to say that there's no tolerance
*  it's just it's not as profound as I think we see with a lot of other drugs and
*  this is probably due to the fact of just like
*  You know, we definitely see like if we look at some pet imaging studies chronic cannabis users do have some down sorry
*  I have to interrupt pet positron emission tomography not pets
*  Don't although people get their pets high and we don't know what those pets think about that not good
*  Don't get dogs. Although if also high one can assume a lot of things about what your pet is thinking while also high
*  Sort of half joke there. But yes positron emission tomography is one way to assess their binding of
*  drugs within the brain as well as activity of
*  endogenous neurotransmitters
*  neuromodulators such as
*  Anandamide dopamine, etc. Yeah, so a typical pet study in a human looking at this
*  They'd give a molecule that's radio labeled that will bind to CB1 receptors
*  You can scan them and then look at the emission rates of the radiation to get an idea of the density of receptors that are
*  In the brain chronic cannabis users tend to have less
*  What that means in terms of
*  The functional outcome is unclear. I mean there could be some I think there's a there's a lot of evidence that
*  There's some degree of a reservoir of CB1 receptors that you know
*  There might be a lot more receptors there than we necessarily always need or are always using let's say so we might be down
*  regulating a component of this but maybe not all of the ones that are required to produce the
*  Psychoactive effects because there's clearly some maintenance of the system that allows someone to continue to get intoxicated
*  And so with cannabis users we do see that but you do see much more profound tolerance with people using
*  High-potency extracts and concentrates and things like this and again surely I think as a response to the biology of
*  Hitting the system that heavily with that much, you know
*  THC as it comes in because they can't titrate it the same way it makes sense. Yeah, these concentrate sound like
*  Something to at least pay attention to as a potential problem
*  I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge our sponsor inside tracker
*  Inside tracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
*  To help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals
*  Now i've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason
*  That many of the factors that impact your immediate and long-term health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test
*  Now a major problem with a lot of blood tests out there
*  Is that you get information back about metabolic factors and hormones and lipids and so forth
*  But you don't know what to do with that information with inside tracker
*  They make it very easy to know what to do with those numbers
*  Because they have a personalized platform that allows you to see the levels of those metabolic factors lipids hormones, etc
*  And they give you specific directives that you can follow related to nutrition behavioral modifications supplementation and more
*  That can help you bring those numbers into the ranges that are optimal for you
*  If you'd like to try inside tracker, you can go to inside tracker.com
*  Huberman to get 10 off their new membership program inside tracker membership offers significantly reduced prices on inside trackers
*  Comprehensive blood panels again, that's inside tracker.com
*  To get 10 off along the lines of use tolerance, etc
*  Is cannabis addictive and or habit forming and I think it's probably important that we distinguish between the two
*  I I may have made this joke in the previous episode on I did on cannabis. I've known a lot of chronic cannabis users
*  and
*  None of them
*  Admit to being addicted
*  It's not my place to uh challenge them on that
*  But they do seem
*  In my experience, this is not an experiment but in my experience more irritable when they don't have access to what they call
*  Their quote unquote medicine. Yeah, so um
*  you know that speaks to a
*  Dependence or something but then we need to be careful because in the classic sense addiction, you know
*  I've defined and others in the field of addiction
*  Have defined it as a you know progressive narrowing of the things that bring you pleasure such that you know, it causes um
*  disruption to other areas of life your life becomes
*  Maladaptive. Yeah, I mean i'm not going to play with the definition of addiction. I feel like
*  I have enough friends in the addiction space that it's a very contentious
*  Sure field so I mean I will try and not use that word
*  Although I understand uh talking to the general public that's kind of you know
*  If you say someone has a use disorder versus an addiction that may not make sense to them
*  But that's the nomenclature now that people are using alcohol use
*  Cannabis use disorder. This is what you start to see now instead of saying being addicted to pot or being addicted to alcohol
*  And so I mean an addiction is obviously a very complex thing that
*  Again, I don't want to touch it simply because it's not my space
*  But that being said there's no question that people can develop cannabis use disorder. I mean, it's it's
*  Definitely a thing. So if we say is cannabis addictive and kind of a you know, normal lay speak
*  I would say yes, it is addictive. What does that look like? How does that relate to other substances of abuse? I mean
*  certainly
*  The outcomes associated with it are going to be slightly different than someone something like opiates or alcohol because that's a totally different beast
*  because you have
*  Fatality potential there's a whole bunch of other health consequences
*  But if we look at how we would define a use disorder
*  The criteria for someone hitting cannabis use disorder is really no different than how someone would hit alcohol use disorder or opiate use disorder
*  In the sense that it can consume their life
*  It can shift the way that they behave they can put themselves in risky positions to get access to a drug
*  It can consume their time and their energy
*  To have it like you said if they don't have access to it it can trigger
*  You know an assembly of behaviors that looks like irritability anger frustration things like that
*  so, I mean
*  The numbers in terms of the conversion rate of use to developing use disorder
*  I would say are not entirely clear the kind of old numbers that used to get tossed around were like 9 to 11
*  Of people that would start initiating cannabis use would probably transition to develop use disorder
*  The more modern numbers I would say
*  You know if we're looking at people who are already using weekly we're talking probably closer to 30 percent
*  Like so it's a much higher
*  I mean when you're using that frequently then the rates of people who would qualify as having cannabis use disorder probably go higher
*  so I just want to make sure i'm understanding clearly for people that use
*  cannabis weekly the
*  Propensity for developing cannabis use disorder is on the order of about 30 percent
*  I'd say in that neighborhood they would probably qualify as meeting criteria for a cannabis use disorder because weekly doesn't seem like
*  That often no
*  I mean it's it depends again on how you vary this like and i've had a lot of conversations with the public and I think
*  Depending on someone's experience in their own or in their own inner circles life with cannabis the way they would view it is very
*  differently because I think a lot of people
*  You know again regardless of anyone's opinion of alcohol if someone told you they had a glass of wine with dinner every night
*  I don't think people would say you have an alcohol use disorder
*  I think that's not uncommon. I don't think they would
*  Similarly if someone had a brandy at the end of the night or like
*  You know a nightcap to go to bed and they did it on a nightly basis
*  I don't think anyone would say that they have a use disorder and I think with cannabis
*  There are a lot of people that kind of fall into that bracket that would use it
*  You know even daily but relatively infrequently and kind of as an end of the day thing
*  I think some of them certainly would fall under the criteria of cannabis use disorder because if you start looking and say well
*  you know if you travel to like
*  Egypt are you going to go put yourself at risk of going to jail to get access to cannabis because you can't function without it
*  If you do then yeah, you know, you've got cannabis use disorder, you know, are you going to burn relationships?
*  Are you going to start failing at meeting responsibilities or getting things done in time because you're preoccupied with cannabis
*  Yes, you're going to hit the criteria for cannabis use disorder
*  If it's someone who's kind of just intermittently using it the same way that a lot of people casually use alcohol. I would say
*  A lot of them probably wouldn't hit criteria
*  But I think to someone who has never had cannabis in their inner circle or in their life
*  They look at it like a drug like cocaine
*  Whereas they're like wow if you're using cocaine on a daily basis, we'd be super concerned about you
*  And so I think that's this like
*  It's just as you go. I mean cannabis is in this really weird
*  Transitionary period I would say of going from illicit to not just because of the changes in the legal regulatory framework
*  I mean in canada now we're like five and a half years into legalization
*  So in many ways I would say the transition has happened where a lot of people view cannabis very similarly to alcohol
*  Whereas you go to some states and the perspective is still very different
*  Certainly if you're still in one of the states where there's no legal access people still look at cannabis the same way
*  They look at a lot of other
*  Um illicit drugs like cocaine or amphetamines or things. That's interesting. I I was under the impression
*  This has really changed over the last, you know, five ten years, you know growing up. It was I mean
*  I think there are still people in jail now because of uh possession and sale of of cannabis and then of course there
*  Are stores not far from here where people are selling ironic. Yeah, sadly. It's a very I mean
*  Obviously a big push for legalization is not
*  Endorsement of the safety of cannabis. It's more the
*  The harms associated with prohibition outweigh the harms associated with legalization. I think that's generally the public health perspective
*  That's certainly what motivated it in canada
*  And there was a you know, some attempts
*  Let's say it was sort of justice in terms of removing criminal records and things
*  May not have been entirely as successful as people had hoped it would be but it certainly has changed things
*  I mean we can look at our federal data and see that arrest rates related to cannabis are obviously
*  Very low compared to what they were
*  Um that obviously becomes very important because there are clearly minoritized communities
*  They get they get hit more with this than other communities
*  And so the kind of perpetual disenfranchisement that happens with a prohibition model
*  In communities that are already suffering from various other things that affect them, um, just potentiates all that so
*  I can understand the legal framework behind why there would be a move to a legalization state over a prohibition state
*  Which again a lot of people confuse
*  Legality with safety which is a weird. I mean alcohol is the perfect example of this
*  I mean you look at the scale of harms on a public health level. I mean alcohol stacks at the top
*  It across the board in terms of harms to the individual harms to society. It's it's a lot
*  Cannabis has harms. There's no question on that. Um, it just would fall lower than alcohol
*  Um, but the way that people view it a lot of people are like alcohol is legal therefore
*  It's safe and it's not something to judge people on
*  Cannabis at least historically was illegal and in some states still is so people view it very differently and I think it's
*  An interesting thing, um
*  Because I feel like you know, despite the fact that some people hate the government and hate the way that it regulates their life
*  There's this weird passive belief that like if the government dictates something is legal. That means it's safe
*  is
*  the legalization of cannabis leading to more cannabis users or fewer, um and or um
*  Incidents of people going into the emergency room
*  Suffering from cannabis induced psychosis something that I hope we can also talk about. Yeah, um
*  So it depends on how you break this down. So what we've seen in canada is I would say there's like demographic differences
*  Uh proportionately when we look at the biggest change in use, it's actually elderly communities. It's like 55 plus
*  Um, especially women over 55 tend to be more cannabis use more cannabis use now granted their baseline was quite low
*  Pre-legalization so if you look at a fold change, it looks like a very dramatic
*  Increase raw numbers. It's probably not that that high
*  But I mean it was like one to two percent or something before and now it's gone up to like eight percent or something
*  So it's a four-fold increase kind of thing
*  So we do see the magnitude of that seems to be the biggest in terms of where the use has come from
*  Definitely the young adult population like 20 24 that group has definitely seen
*  Increase use as well. Does it split male female?
*  Historically cannabis tended to be more male biased. I'd say the the gender separation there has kind of narrowed quite a bit
*  Where you do see a lot more like more females used and historically had
*  There is a little bit of difference females tend to prefer edibles over males. So
*  Males tend to like inhalation over females. So like roots of administration vary a little bit based on
*  Who someone is but
*  Yeah, interestingly we don't have a lot of actual indication that teenagers have used more
*  So like, you know, you look at 14 to 18 year olds that has been now granted our baseline going in was pretty high
*  As is down here in the states
*  I mean can in the states both hover you look at like gray 12ers and you know
*  It's somewhere between 35 and 40 percent of them have used cannabis now
*  I mean you even have some that are like, hmm, probably around five percent are probably almost daily users
*  So like you do have a pretty high baseline to begin with in that group, but that has remained relatively unchanged
*  If anything some of the states when they legalized saw slight dips in in teenage use of cannabis
*  So I think like that's obviously an important demographic to have tracked
*  This was one of the concerns with legalization was you'd prove, you know increase access teenagers
*  We get it from their parents and whatnot or had just you know other siblings and stuff
*  And so you get this big boost in consumption
*  But we don't seem to see that in terms of raw numbers of teenagers who are using cannabis. So
*  So that's good er visits
*  So we did a an interesting rollout in canada. We legalized flower for a year before edibles came online
*  So we have kind of a before and after
*  Once edibles became available. There was a notable increase in
*  Unintentional pediatric consumption that resulted in er visits because kids would you know, a lot of these look like gummies and candies
*  People are buying them not, you know storing them properly kids would find them and eat them and like become
*  Very intoxicated. I want to make mention of something along those lines. Um, I actually know somebody
*  whose child
*  Accidentally
*  ate thc containing gummies
*  Um, fortunately the child was fine
*  Um, but they're actually pretty serious ramifications for this. Um
*  The parents actually are quite susceptible to legal action if this happens, right?
*  So this is something to like really keep in mind. I mean there are a million other
*  Health related reasons why this is yeah, I don't know if that's true in canada the same way
*  But I in the states, yeah
*  like if if your kid gets into
*  A stash of thc containing gummies and ends up in the emergency room
*  There will also be most likely there'll be a police visit to that emergency room also and it doesn't bode well for the parents
*  so it's a very serious issue and again, this was highlighted to me by someone that I know who um
*  Didn't anticipate any of this but you know kids are good at finding candy
*  Yeah, and if that candy contains thc and they end up in the emergency room serious issues
*  Nonetheless, if your kid is acting strange because you think they ingested thc containing anything take them to the emergency room
*  Anyway, well, so this was one of the things that also was influenced by legalization is in canada
*  some of the increase in the er visits was because of
*  the shift in legalization and the change in policy and so
*  You know if your kid ends up drunk underage
*  It's not the same ramifications as if your kid used an illegal substance underage
*  And so people are when once cannabis was legal people were more likely to actually go into the er
*  Because the consequences were different. I see and so sure some of this is availability and some of it is just like
*  Okay, i'm not as concerned now about
*  Something happening because i've taken my kid in like i'm not gonna have my kid taken away from me or whatnot
*  So so there is I mean both those factors I think have contributed to it
*  But we definitely see the majority at least of kids ending up in the er is almost all based on edibles
*  that's I
*  I can't imagine
*  A situation where that would happen from inhalation. It would be very rare if it would it's almost always edibles because kids find them
*  So as long as we're talking about edibles
*  Is there any fundamental difference between
*  um the dose regulation that you talked about earlier of inhalants versus uh, excuse me versus edibles
*  Meaning earlier you said that even if it's high thc containing
*  Uh cannabis people will self-regulate to achieve the same approximately the same blood concentrations
*  but with edibles, I imagine you eat half a cookie a quarter of a cookie and
*  You can end up in a vastly different place than you expected. So edibles
*  So this throws a wrench in the whole system
*  And i'll say this in the context of blood levels and then what that means from our regulatory capacity as well because of the impact this has
*  so
*  Edibles are very low doses for the most part
*  I mean in canada at least you cannot buy a pack of edibles and I think this law might be changing at least
*  When they first brought it in no pack could have more than 10 milligrams of thc in it
*  So that either meant one 10 meg gummy or two five meg gummies or four 2.5 meg gummies you get it
*  um, so you couldn't in one package have more than 10 milligrams of thc now for
*  people who are
*  I would say relatively naive to cannabis or thc even people who might use it intermittently
*  Most people will feel five milligrams like they'll feel some form of intoxication
*  You know some will even feel it at 2.5 megs most people will feel at five virtually everyone will feel it at 10
*  Now if you look at the blood levels these produce
*  we're now talking blood levels of two to five nanograms per mil so
*  Folds lower than what you get from inhalation before you said 100. Yeah, so this is dramatically lower and so
*  So also the time course of this is fundamentally different so
*  And uh oral consumption, you know
*  You're looking at a minimum of 30 to 45 minutes for onset of intoxication
*  For some people up to 90 minutes after they've eaten now. This is also the reason why
*  The majority of adverse events that happen with cannabis happen with edibles because people don't understand this and so they eat a cookie or a gummy
*  They wait half an hour like i'm not feeling anything
*  I clearly didn't take enough and they'll double their dose
*  And then like 15 minutes later it starts hitting them and then like once it fully kicks in
*  It's just like a steamroller like i've heard of this. Yeah, I mean there was that new york
*  I think it was maureen doubter someone went down to colorado and she ate like
*  An insane amount of thc and a chocolate bar some like 50 or 100 milligrams and spent like the weekend on the floor
*  Of a hotel room being like this was the most aversive experience. Why would anyone do this?
*  Um, and again, I think people just don't understand the dosing around this and so this is one of the things we're trying to do in
*  Canada and I was creating this idea of standardized dosing units so that people have an like we with alcohol like we always say
*  One beer is the equivalent to one glass of wine versus, you know, like a shot of tequila or something so that there's some
*  Uh comparator that people understand how many drinks are, you know, you know, is they two drinks you do
*  You're gonna hit legal limit kind of thing. It seems very important
*  Yeah
*  and so this is very difficult to do with cannabis because
*  The dosing with oral consumption is just a different ball game than it is with inhalation
*  But what happens with oral consumption is like it kind of very slowly leaks out of the gi track
*  and it also goes through first pass metabolism in the liver and what happens there is you get a metabolite called 11 hydroxy thc, which
*  Seems to be a bit more potent than thc is in terms of its ability to activate the receptor
*  So and its efficacy at least at driving a response through cb1 receptors seems to be higher than what you would get
*  With just the parent molecule of thc itself
*  and
*  So and it seems to accumulate a lot more as well
*  So at any given time, you know
*  You've got thc kind of leaking out of the gut going through the liver making 11 hydroxy
*  And it progressively accumulates in the brain and that's one of the reasons why it takes
*  You know 45 to 90 minutes to kick in but then the high itself also lasts like six hours four to six
*  Sometimes eight depending on the person what they've eaten
*  Versus inhalation is just this like spike so you get this very rapid because it goes right through the lungs into the blood
*  Goes into the brain, but it also clears out and so yeah people will start feeling intoxicated two to five minutes
*  They the peak high is like 15 to 30 minutes maybe from consumption and then they'll start to come back down and
*  You will still see some indications of intoxication that can go on for three to four hours
*  But the bulk of the intoxication from inhalation is done by two hours for the most part
*  As long as we're on the topic of time course, um, you know based on what I was able to find
*  I believed and tell me if I was wrong that cannabis can stay in one system for as long as 80 days
*  The reason I brought this up. Yeah, um previously was
*  There are a number of people who have used cannabis are going to take a drug test and want to know how fast it can clear
*  from their system
*  um
*  But based on conversations we had offline
*  Um sounds like that 80 days might be a bit too long
*  I mean you could still fail a drug test at 80s
*  I would say I feel like I think the way it was worded more was like that you made it sound like that was the standard
*  I wouldn't say that was the standard at all. I would say
*  for the majority of people
*  30 days probably after that
*  They would not pass or they would be able to pass a drug test
*  But that abstinence for 30 days after abstaining for 30s and it's going to be highly variable depending on how much you consume
*  I mean if you're talking about someone who's used it once I I don't imagine it would be in your system
*  How long that'd be surprising the thing is thc is?
*  Olypophilic molecule fat soluble. Yeah, so it's fat soluble. It likes the storage
*  It doesn't like the blood the blood is aqueous and watery it likes fat
*  So it goes into the brain it goes into the fat and it kind of resides there and
*  It can
*  Essentially kind of slowly leak back as it as you know thc concentrations in the blood would reduce
*  Thc that's in the fat will start kind of leaking back into the blood still so detectably
*  You will still have thc for quite some time
*  I mean some of this again
*  It's going to be depending on how much cannabis someone's used how much thc they've consumed how long it's been in their system for
*  I would have thought this was going to be somewhat reflective of people's body fat content
*  Although talking to colleagues who do this they say not always
*  but we do know, you know
*  certain things like
*  Exercise for example anything that's going to trigger adrenaline because adrenaline is lipolytic. So adrenaline causes fat to
*  Metabolize and release stuff that's inside it
*  So there are plenty of cases i've heard from people where they were testing themselves and were negative
*  And then went for a run or went to the gym and then tested positive or lost weight
*  Yeah, or they've lost weight and anything that's going to cause the the lipolysis to occur so that it releases that thc
*  um
*  You can certainly all of a sudden test positive again when someone had tested negative previously
*  Just because of the fact that there still is some in the fat
*  And so this is where something like and this is what I mean by standardization of regulatory issues become very complicated was I remember
*  Right when legalization happened in canada all these kind of chemists were like
*  Talking to me about they're going to create like a breathalyzer for cannabis because this way they'll be able to do roadside detection
*  The same way they could do with alcohol
*  And I kept trying to say to them i'm like the rate limiting step here is not the science of detection thresholds
*  it's the biology of how the body processes cannabis and you're never going to get a test that works because
*  You can take someone who has eaten an edible and is profoundly intoxicated
*  And they will have possibly under five nanograms per mil of thc in their blood
*  but you're talking about this metabolite that can come from the
*  Edibles that doesn't come from inhalants that can have a much more potent from inhalant
*  But not nearly as much as you get from edibles. Um, so it's a different it's sort of a different situation altogether
*  It is but it's also the timeline because of the fact that with inhalation. It's like a uh, a bolus that hits you at once
*  You get a high blood level
*  um
*  With edibles, it's like the time course
*  So, I mean it's going to be like five nanograms per mil, let's say but it would be like that for a long time
*  Whereas the hundred nanogram per mil from smoking is like for 20 minutes and then it starts dropping so
*  but the problem is with the way that um, you detect it is you can take someone who's a chronic cannabis user
*  And is completely sober and hasn't consumed in a day or two
*  And their basal levels of thc in their blood may be higher than someone who's profoundly intoxicated by an edible
*  Just by the sheer nature of the fact that it would reside in their fat tissue or their brain
*  It would leak back into the blood and so
*  You have this issue where you let's say your cutoff was five nanograms per mil
*  Which is for some of the stuff detection thresholds would hover around that area. So you could have someone who's dead sober
*  That tests positive and someone who's profoundly intoxicated who tests negative. So it's like what's the value in this?
*  It's not telling us anything
*  Well, I guess it sounds like the drug tests either have to be revised or discarded and it also sounds like if somebody is going to
*  Take a drug test for cannabis and they have used cannabis in any form in
*  The previous 90 days, let's say going for a run right before your test is going to liberate
*  Whatever, um thc resides in the fat stores potentially. Yeah, so I mean it is it is a lot of people are writing this down
*  Um
*  Along the lines of what's known and not known. I'm curious what is known and not known about the effects of
*  cannabis thc in particular on hormones
*  I've seen studies that cite increases in testosterone from cannabis use
*  I've seen studies that cite increases in estrogen from cannabis use and they argue for increased aromatization of testosterone
*  Intestrogen as the mechanism
*  I've also seen studies that say the exact opposite. Yeah, so, um, is there any
*  Global takeaway message yet or is it just highly variable or depends too much on dose and individual age etc
*  That we just really can't I would say it's the it's
*  There's nothing that's super clean cut
*  Um, I mean I know in the previous podcast you talked about a prolactin thing, right?
*  Well, there there's um, and this is where I think it's important that people understand that you know on this podcast we cover
*  Science and studies, but we also pull from common experience that people want explained if we can
*  And one of the experiences that is talked about a lot in certain
*  Let's just say online communities is the experience of people who had no pre-existing
*  Gynecomastia male breast development. Yeah, we'll smoke
*  Marijuana does we call it marijuana these days. I got I go with cannabis. I got I actually got it
*  I got um someone I got a lot of comments that said marijuana is an inappropriate terms. Okay
*  Smoke we'll go back to that
*  That was new to me. I didn't know so forgive me if I don't know. I mean, I understand it
*  But yeah, a lot of people don't know. Okay, so um, we'll smoke cannabis and experience gynecomastia or in females
*  So males and females both have breast tissue, but in males, it's typically
*  It's not hypertrophied. Um, but they'll smoke cannabis and get a um gynecomastia growth of the male breast tissue
*  Um that's sometimes reversible sometimes not presumably through the aromatization of testosterone into estrogen
*  Which then acts on the tissue makes it grow as well as um reports of breast tissue tenderness after cannabis use in in females
*  So that was sort of the origin of that discussion around
*  does cannabis
*  impact
*  Aromatization of testosterone into estrogen and you can find a little bit of evidence for that
*  But you can also find evidence to the contrary in the scientific literature. So i'm just curious your thoughts
*  It's super mixed. So I mean you talk about something like prolactin for example
*  That is another one that's obviously involved in in this whole cascade stuff
*  Generally, I would say the the bulk of the literature actually says that cannabis would suppress prolactin not increase it
*  That's the majority of the literature because dopamine is one of the main ways that prolactin is suppressed. They're kind of in a seesaw
*  They work in somewhat seesaw fashion
*  And it probably I mean the rodent work would suggest it's through dopamine
*  That's turning off prolactin because you can reverse some of these effects by playing with dopamine signaling
*  So I don't doubt that's the mechanism but so typically I would say more often
*  I mean there's studies with inhalation and iv that have generally found reduced, uh prolactin and in chronic cannabis users
*  They find somewhat lower resting states of prolactin that's been found in one study that came out of yale
*  testosterone gets a little bit more complicated because
*  There are a lot of studies that find a to begin with
*  Cannabis users may have higher levels of testosterone just at rest now whether that's a pre-existing reason to think that would be the case
*  I don't know. I
*  Yeah, I mean that being said a lot of the stuff now granted this was mostly done in the 70s
*  um
*  and like this is from my previous life because my undergrad and graduate supervisor he was a
*  Neuroendocrinologist focused much more on sex hormones and reproductive hormones. So we've written a few reviews
*  So i've done like reviews on this area and I know the literature somewhat
*  it's mixed but generally from the 70s studies what they would often see is that if they um
*  Would look serially look at testosterone after someone consumed they would have little dips like that wasn't uncommon for them to find it
*  Not every study found it
*  um
*  That being said the kind of range that testosterone stayed in was always the normative range
*  Like it was never that it went so low that someone would have classified as being hypogonadal or
*  Would lead to something like gynecomastia at least from a testosterone deficiency side in terms of the balance between testosterone and estradiol
*  um
*  I don't know as much about the aromatization side of it again. I'd say it's pretty mixed. I mean
*  I don't think the gynecomastia stuff is I mean certainly people online might be talking about it and there might be some other components to
*  This i've also heard and again, this isn't like science. This is just
*  The same kind of stuff you see on random internet communities people talking about oh, well, you know, it has plant estrogen
*  So maybe they're subbing in and having estrogenic effects. I don't know how valid any of this is
*  Yeah, it seems a bit. I mean there are phytoestrogens in tons of different plants
*  the sort of attacks on soy and the attacks on uh,
*  This I think grew out of the um, kind of the soy versus meat communities and plant-based versus carnivore
*  This podcast has always been agnostic with respect to nutrition and is really um, if we encourage anything, it's that people consume
*  unprocessed and minimally processed foods
*  As the bulk of their food intake there seems to be enough data on that
*  but whether or not people choose to be vegan and eat a lot of plants or carnivore and just meat, you know,
*  we've essentially stepped out of that debate because um,
*  Let's just say it's as futile as um
*  About any other debate. You're just never gonna it's completely circular you end up right back in twitter
*  Yeah, and I think that um, I mean when it comes to something like this, I don't
*  I've not seen any compelling evidence for it
*  So I can't I certainly wouldn't say that it's a typical side effect that men would experience is like developing breast tissue in response to
*  Cannabis I feel like if that was the case it would be very known in the scientific community as something that comes out
*  so this seems to be something that um
*  purportedly occurs on a backdrop of elevated androgens meaning in puberty
*  or a backdrop of some other um
*  Form of androgen like someone who's on steroids. Yeah, but that's not the community i'm referring to it seems that um, because transient
*  gynecomastia during puberty is actually fairly common
*  because of there's just so much androgen being produced in puberty that some gets aromatized and that um,
*  The idea i'm not saying it's stating this as fact is that it may exacerbate that in any case
*  it sounds like the takeaway from this is that there
*  Aren't a lot of conclusive studies about the effects of cannabis on testosterone or estrogen or aromatization in any direction
*  I don't I mean i'd say like
*  Yeah, this enough studies to suggest that you might see transient drops in testosterone from cannabis and it seems to be relatively short-lived
*  um, it doesn't seem but again
*  A lot of these studies also find that the basal testosterone is already kind of high to begin with so you're staying in a normal dynamic range
*  Again, it's homeostatic just like just like the endocannabinoids. Yeah, so and that's the thing
*  I mean testosterone fluctuates across the day anyway, so it's already I mean there's other things that fluctuate
*  It's like cortisol these hormones have cycles
*  so as long as you're in this normal range there really shouldn't be any kind of like
*  behavioral like in terms of sex drive for testosterone or like physiological
*  Like gynecomastia or some change in I mean now there are potentially effects of thc directly on the testes that could affect sperm
*  That could happen independent of changes in testosterone. Are those positive or negative changes? I'm assuming that they're the studies you're referring to saw
*  Disrupted what they call sperm quality which has to do with motility, etc
*  Yeah, I mean a lot of the kind of in vitro stuff definitely would suggest that some of the animal stuff as well
*  The human stuff is definitely a bit mixed. I mean, but again if anything it would be like yeah could have some effect on sperm
*  So I have like as we say this I'm just
*  Chuckling to myself because anytime this conversation comes up about a substance and sperm quality or egg quality
*  I always get a barrage of comments of people telling me how many children they conceived while under the influence
*  No one is saying that you're gonna be infertile, but you know if people are having challenges
*  Conceiving it might be something to think about I would say that I would agree on that
*  So I would say if someone was asking me this and they were trying to get pregnant and struggling
*  I would say well definitely cut cannabis because
*  Some people may be more impacted by than others
*  So for some you know various biological reasons that we don't have a biomarker for
*  There may be some men that use cannabis and it has a profound effect on their sperm quality of their sperm capacitance their ability to maintain
*  Fertility and for the bulk majority of minutes
*  That's probably not the case
*  But again, if you're someone who is struggling and you use cannabis male or female
*  I would say cut that out and see if that has an effect for you
*  Along those lines. I saw it kind of a jaw-dropping statistic and I I'm not sure I
*  Still believe it, but you tell me what you know about this
*  Which is that up to 15% of
*  Pregnant women in the US have used cannabis during pregnancy
*  That just seems that number just seems too high and yet, you know, it exists out there. It's very I mean, I've heard higher
*  No, I've heard higher numbers
*  No, I mean so I've heard as low as two and I've heard as high as 20. Okay two sounds like okay
*  I that I could imagine
*  But as high as 20 and do we know what the effects on the developing fetus are there's a lot to unpack there
*  so first thing going back to the the
*  Levels that's challenging because again this depends on are you talking about self-report or are you talking about verified blood levels?
*  Because those have varied so some of the higher numbers actually come from blood levels where they've taken blood samples and found THC
*  But the women have reported not using
*  Cannabis and so there the idea that it's like the self-report numbers tend to come in around two or three
*  My guess is the real number is probably somewhere around 10%
*  but that also is going to vary depending on what you're talking about because there are a proportion of people who are using cannabis and
*  Become pregnant and are unaware. They're pregnant and are still using cannabis and that would still qualify
*  Under the way that it's defined that someone used cannabis while pregnant
*  So the majority I would say the overwhelming majority of people once they learn they're pregnant now that can be all the way up to
*  almost the end of the first trimester
*  Typically stop using cannabis that seems to be the norm. I would say important point there
*  Yeah
*  And I think also the number that carry on through the entire gestational period is is going to be a lot less
*  I would guess now the motivations for this quite often are
*  More in the capacity of the kind of antinousiant
*  Qualities that cannabis can have for some people and for women struggling with morning sickness now anecdotally. I have heard women say, you know
*  With the history of things like thalidomide and other anti-nausea and drugs that had profound teratogenic effects on the fetuses
*  Women have said that they would rather use cannabis than one of these other compounds because they're less concerned about the impacts of cannabis than they are
*  Because of the you know, the thalidomide effects that happened and the little might effects are
*  malformation of the limbs and another bodily structures in fetuses
*  It was an absolute tragedy of medicine that this occurred in even even one
*  birth but
*  Yes, the reason why thalidomide is now I believe banned as a drug for use during pregnancy
*  Yeah, I mean I would I actually have no idea but I would imagine
*  I think it would be one of those hard things to sell given its history especially
*  but so I think there's a reticence of a lot of people to
*  consider using pharmaceuticals to regulate nausea because they're uncertain of the consequences of it and
*  They feel that cannabis may be safer now
*  That in and of itself could present some problems in terms of that thought process now
*  there was also a study that I thought was like
*  some of these things just
*  Frustrate you it's where they actually decided to call this was done in Colorado where they called dispensaries and just acted naive and asked what their
*  Recommendations were I was something like 80 to 85 percent of them were actually recommending that
*  People would use cannabis to manage morning sickness and I thought that was like it's just one of these disappointing things where you're like
*  Why are you being so wildly irresponsible to kind of promote these things and this is you're talking about that irresponsible that the dispensaries would say that
*  Or irresponsible that the study was carried out that way because it's a little bit of
*  Entrapment you said it not me could be I mean I mean you can you can balk at either side of this
*  I think it's I mean I have a
*  Lot of frustration in general with the information that bud tenders put out into the world. Is that what they're called?
*  But yeah, but tenders that's kind of like the colloquial term that people will use for someone who sells cannabis at a dispensary
*  We says in Canada and I've heard this throughout the states as well. I
*  I
*  Personally have been a huge advocate for the fact that I think so, you know
*  I worked in restaurants and bars and stuff when I was younger and for me to serve alcohol
*  I had to undergo I don't know if you do this in the States in Canada
*  You have to do like it's like a weekend course essentially called like serving it right or some other terminology
*  We learn the basics of alcohol
*  Harms blah blah blah how to tell if someone's intoxicated when you have to cut them off all these things that you have to do to
*  Be able to serve alcohol. I have no idea if this exists in the states
*  But it was a thing in Canada bartenders in the US put in the comments on YouTube
*  Do you have to undergo training about alcohol?
*  even if it's just like an online quiz, but like so I my perspective is because
*  Pre-legalization at least in Canada
*  there was somewhat of I think of a misguided thought that people would leverage their physicians for knowledge about cannabis and what's become very
*  Apparent is that the overwhelming majority of people talk to the people selling them the cannabis and yet those people selling cannabis
*  don't need to have undergone any form of education and so like this kind of kills me because
*  We've worked very hard to try and create educational platforms that are like
*  agnostic in terms of our position on cannabis that are just based on the science and an executive director of an organization called the Canadian
*  consortium for the investigation of cannabinoids the CCIC and it's
*  We've done CME courses for physicians to try and train them about cannabis because I think it's important that physicians understand this but
*  I've tried suggesting that I think that anyone selling cannabis should undergo
*  a course like this just so that there's some consensus in the informed level that someone
*  who comes in because a lot of people going to buy cannabis are quite naive about it and they just
*  I mean even when we're talking about dosing what we've talked about with edibles or smoking or how people consume it like
*  you need to have a reliable source of information at the front line that is able to relay that to people and
*  It becomes very frustrating to me that that they have become the main source of information that people go and I'm uncertain
*  Of what their level of training is you're certainly doing your part to provide the public education about cannabis now
*  So we all appreciate your highly informed and and broad distribution of this information because this is also an issue with
*  Psychedelics which currently don't have legal status in the US
*  This is an ongoing process of whether or not it will right now things are really on the teeter-totter with MDMA where we await the decision
*  from the FDA, but the early recommendation to
*  To the FDA was to not approve MDMA as a treatment for PTSD
*  That's a sort of today and you know mid to late June 2024. We'll see what happens, but this is also the case for
*  Ketamine which is has legal status, but many people are accessing ketamine not through a physician but through online sources
*  So what you're speaking to here is a much larger issue
*  And I absolutely agree with you. I mean, I think
*  Most people are probably not aware except by
*  Experience positive or negative in some cases about the differences in blood concentration as it relates to number of tokes versus concentration
*  Versus edible. I mean, these are critical themes especially for where we're gonna go next
*  Which is you know all the discussion about high THC and psychosis. Yeah. Yeah exactly
*  So I think that I just wish I mean again, even if this was just like an online course that wasn't that much
*  but at least had some consensus of information that was the basics about how to
*  You know have conversations and I mean some of the our our system at least is somewhat provincially regulated
*  So like, you know, our organization has worked with like the Ontario group that deals with cannabis distribution the Ontario like the OCS
*  Which is Ontario cannabis stores and help to create some information
*  Pamphlets and stuff again. It's not the same as a teaching course, but at least it's like these little
*  infographics stuff that kind of like gives people rough breakdowns of things and
*  Kind of gives you a little bit of information about dosing and understanding things like especially with something like edibles how long you should wait
*  Just stuff like this and sounds like the take home messages
*  Proceed with caution, you know low and slow. I mean, that's the yeah
*  I mean, I don't don't ingest too much too quickly like really, you know, if one is going to explore this legally, of course
*  You know take a little bit wait take a little bit wait
*  Because otherwise you're gonna get the what was the reporter? I think it was more in doubt
*  But I right you're gonna I don't know actually when I say that she's still on the floor in a Colorado hotel
*  She may have recovered reporting from the floor in Colorado
*  but like
*  It yeah, it's it can become very frustrating
*  It's just the kind of lack of understanding that exists in this space
*  And so I think this is one of the reasons why we've really kind of tried to push the public health side of this a lot
*  more and we have I mean there was
*  The Center for addiction and mental health in Canada, which does a lot of the organization of these things
*  They did kind of put together what I found to be really useful which again could be leveraged in the States
*  These are all accessible in lines. It's called the lower risk cannabis use guidelines
*  They kind of tried to create a framework that is similar to how people have done stuff with alcohol
*  That just kind of goes through and a lot of it is this low and slow approach
*  But it's like obviously you want no risk you abstain if you're gonna use these are the different ways to engage in harm reduction
*  You know, like obviously oral consumption has you know, you avoid the issue of lung damage that you could get from smoking
*  But then you know with oral consumption you have to be aware of dosing and timing and all these other considerations
*  But what about vaping?
*  It can people self regulate their THC
*  Concentration in the blood by vaping as well as they can by joint or bong or other
*  Depend on exactly what you're vaping. So and the states I've noticed when people say vaping they almost
*  Exclusively refer to some kind of oil based product that's in a pen. So in those situations
*  That's gonna really heavily depend on what the concentration of THC in that product is now
*  The other form of vaping that I think is a little bit more common in Canada
*  Maybe is vaping of the plant matter itself
*  And so this is where they have like a vaporizer device that heats
*  The cannabis to a point that will essentially hit the lift point to vaporize THC and the cannabinoids big bag
*  Yeah, yeah, like a volcano. I've seen it
*  Yeah, but it doesn't create any plant combustion
*  And so there are studies that have been run on that that have shown that you avoid the combustion byproduct
*  So people don't like exhale carbon monoxide or these other things that we know can be damaging
*  If they're vaping plant matter that was actually somewhat approved as like a medical device pre legalization when Canada cannabis in Canada was only under medical authorization
*  Because of the reduced harm associated with vaporizing the plant matter versus smoking it
*  That is I would say as a safe guideline for harm reduction that if you're gonna try and avoid
*  You know, there's still gonna be some issues that happen with vaporization of plant matter, but it's not the same as combustion
*  So you avoid like some of the other issues that come out when we're talking about
*  Oil based vapor products or whatever they're in they're using some kind of oil based solution
*  Who knows I mean we don't have the research on this like we just don't know I mean we certainly know
*  Like there have been some pretty big errors of like the things that happen in the States like there was that problem where all those people
*  Developed kind of I don't popcorn lung or that lung inflammation where several people died from vaping products
*  Which seemed to be like a byproduct I believe of them adding like vitamin E acetate or something into the
*  Because again, everyone just assumes it's inert
*  But then when it when it combusts through the vaporization process it creates a massive irritant on lung tissue
*  And so that was just you know
*  Again in my mind. This is a problem with a lack of a federal
*  Regulatory framework because stuff like this happens you you would not see that on a federal landscape because you'd have to go through
*  Testing like people it's kind of the Wild West you get down here every state has its own rules
*  People there's not really a lot of like regulation of things one if you go overseas. It's even more wild
*  I mean, I mean then you have no idea what you're consuming anywhere. I would say just because the outside I mean
*  Again, Netherlands is a little bit of a different situation
*  They're not legal. They're decriminalized. I don't know how well the regulation over there the product is
*  You know we're gonna be doing episodes on stem cells and you got people flying out of country do some cell injections people are getting
*  Them down in Florida who went blind from the injections of stem cells into the eye in an attempt to save what little vision they
*  Already had
*  Probably don't want to get me started on that one. I'm in total agreement with you by the way
*  I want to make sure that I ask about
*  psychosis and paranoia yeah
*  I've previously said and I was sort of I wasn't joking but I have observed
*  in my history that when people started to
*  Experience some degree of anxiety or paranoia when smoking
*  cannabis that
*  Sometimes the message they would receive back is to take more to just adjust the subjective experience. I think that's a terrible idea
*  Baffled that you heard that I have no idea. Let's just say I did more than hear it. Yeah, see I've observed it
*  I cannot even understand that that is the strangest thing I've ever heard but okay. Yeah, well usually the advice of
*  People in terms of that was recreational drug-taking is is rarely excellent advice
*  I mean I agree with you on that point for sure that you should not be consuming more if you're having a bad reaction
*  To it because that will just like grease the wheels going downhill for sure. Yeah
*  I also
*  Am aware that there are some very high-profile
*  papers that have been published in the last really five years or so pointing to
*  Potential increased risk for psychosis of lasting duration
*  Even after the effects of cannabis have worn off in high THC cannabis users in particular
*  High THC cannabis users that initiate that cannabis use young and this might be preferentially impacting males
*  I want to make clear that what I just said is not a statement of absolute fact. It's my understanding of the
*  conclusions of these papers
*  There are other conclusions in these papers also
*  But that particular conclusion seems to be important enough that they place it in the abstract and it's reached major press headlines
*  so I guess the simple question which probably doesn't have a simple answer is
*  Does THC
*  Cause psychosis. So yeah, there's not a simple answer to that
*  And I think that also is a question over whether you're talking about acute drug induced psychotic episode versus the development of a chronic
*  psychotic disease like schizophrenia
*  So the first arm of that is just can people acutely have a psychotic episode to THC or cannabis and the answer that is yes
*  It's not common. I would say in terms of adverse events that happen with people consuming cannabis. It's on the rarer side
*  But it definitely can happen. So less than 5% of people that always much less than that
*  I mean, it's certainly I mean, it's if something like this was happening at a regular frequency. It would be very well known
*  What about anxiety attack? Yeah anxiety attack is I'd say more of a standard indication that someone's kind of gone overboard like that's not
*  Dosage overboard or does it carry the same set and setting considerations that
*  You know psychedelics like psilocybin
*  Both so I think there's some contextual component to it. There was like I mean back in the 70s when they did more
*  Let's say interesting studies. There's one where basically they dose people on THC and then had them undergo oral surgery
*  Which seems like in hindsight a very bad idea and I think virtually everyone in that study had a panic attack like
*  so it really potentiated the stress of what they were undergoing and
*  Had they been given that same dose in a different setting?
*  I'm not sure it would have evoked that kind of response
*  but there is definitely a dose effect to this in terms of like
*  you know the kind of classic low dose aspects of
*  like of THC or cannabis like that are usually considered more the
*  positive pleasurable
*  Responses that are why people use like it reduces anxiety it relaxes blah blah blah
*  That is more of like a low to normal ish dose
*  Let's say of what someone consumes to produce those responses if they start going upwards though. It's not like it's graded
*  It's like a full flip like it. It's not linear at all
*  It's almost like it goes in the opposite direction
*  So you know someone can use cannabis to reduce anxiety
*  But then cannabis can also trigger anxiety in other people and even in the same person if they consume too much
*  and a lot of this at least
*  We think has to do with the ability of it to regulate both excitatory neurotransmission and inhibitory and so
*  For reasons that we don't totally understand there's like way more cannabinoid receptors on inhibitory neurons than there is on excitatory neurons
*  But in the early days of creating the genetic lines
*  Giovanni Marzoccano and Beat Lutz or over in Europe created like deletion of CB1 only from excitatory neurons or only from inhibitory
*  Neurons, okay, so to just clarify for people these are
*  laboratory mice that are genetically modified so that they contain or lack specific receptors on
*  particular neuron type so that researchers can parse the effects of THC on
*  What we're referring to as inhibitory neurons which quiet other neurons
*  Versus excitatory neurons which excite other neurons and so forth and in doing so to understand some of the network biology
*  Which is basically impossible to do in a typical mouse what's called a wild type mouse or a human
*  Because when one ingests the drug or when the mouse is given the drug it affects any site in the brain
*  Potentially any site in the brain where the CB1 express
*  Yeah, it was like a full body deletion of CB1 and you give a mouse THC doesn't respond to it at all. Not surprisingly
*  That's a comforting experiment. You want to see that result. Yeah, exactly
*  That's how we know CB1 drives all the kind of psychoactive effects of THC
*  so if you delete CB1 off of inhibitory GABA neurons even though that removes like
*  70% of the neuro of the CB1 receptors in the brain those animals look just like wild type
*  They still get like they still exhibit all the classic signs of intoxication in terms of how they would respond to like pain
*  Sensitivity or locomotion or these other like assays we use in mice to tell if they're high if you delete it the CB1 only
*  Enough of excitatory neurons the glutamate neurons then you see
*  What looks like the full knockout? So now the animals don't seem to get high
*  So even though the majority of CB1 receptors seem to be on these inhibitory GABA neurons
*  It's the CB1 on the glutamatergic excitatory neurons that mediate most of the classic signs of what we would consider
*  intoxication from THC or cannabis, but what's interesting is
*  The other thing is
*  Biat worked with the Spanish group 10 12 years ago
*  Then they showed they're looking at anxiety that if you delete CB1 only off of excitatory neurons you lose the anti-anxiety
*  anxiolytic effects of THC
*  But you still have the you know panicky
*  Angiogenic effects of high dose if you delete CB1 off of only the inhibitory GABA neurons
*  You still have the low dose anti-anxiety effect, but now you don't have the high dose
*  Angiogenic panicky effect. So what that was suggesting was that
*  for some reason
*  CB1 like THC will initially hit CB1 on kind of glutamatergic neurons and
*  Essentially the thought is this will reduce excitatory transmission and probably quiet down circuits
*  And if we're talking about something like the amygdala, this is probably how it's reducing anxiety
*  Whereas as dosing starts to increase and you start to saturate the CB1 on the GABA neurons and turn off inhibition
*  Then the network effect is more of an amplification and that seems to result in the development of kind of an angiogenic
*  Pro anxiety response that's obviously undesirable
*  Why there's this differential shift that it's not exactly clear
*  I mean
*  It's probably either due to some of the like biology of exactly where the CB1 receptors sit
*  On excitatory or inhibitory neurons relative to all the machinery that regulates transmitter release
*  I mean Biat Lutz has definitely done some stuff looking at the ability of
*  cannabinoid receptors to evoke signaling responses in a cell and on glutamate neurons
*  They're much more sensitive than they are in GABA neurons. So there's probably a dose threshold
*  So it does look like this kind of you know
*  Low dosing what most people are trying to achieve I would assume when they consume cannabis is probably these effects mediated by
*  Quieting down excitatory transmission and then the adverse effects when someone consumes too much and they have a negative response
*  That's probably due to the higher dose starting to saturate on the inhibitory neurons
*  Now we obviously can never test something like that in humans because we can't know but based on what we've seen in animals
*  That's my theory of kind of how this is working and why we see these kind of classic biphasic effects
*  So yeah too much THC not a good thing because then you start maybe disinhibiting things like the amygdala and producing these kind of
*  Panicky angiogenic like outcomes on that scale though. I mean paranoia obviously that's a hard
*  I don't know how you study that in a rodent. I mean, that's just a strange thing
*  But I mean that's kind of the precedent of when you start going into the psychosis because obviously paranoia would be a big component of that
*  Someone wants to ask me a question about you know, you know have you know, what happens in the brain?
*  Like imaging wise when someone's having like a psychotic episode from cannabis and I was kind of thinking like how would that study get done?
*  like probably on accident because somebody takes cannabis is
*  In the scanner and then having a psychotic episode, but chances are they're gonna try and get out
*  For those that don't know these I don't want to scare people out of doing MRI or fMRI, but you know, you're typically
*  Told to stay extremely still there's sometimes even a bite bar, you know
*  Like this is a very controlled environment not not an environment that you would want to be in during a psychotic episode
*  I can't actually even imagine how that would go down
*  So I'm like where this is something I don't think we're ever gonna have an answer to because I don't think I don't think you
*  Can actually ever test it but in terms of people having this kind of psychotic response, it is pretty
*  Rare I mean and I say this because I can think of in Canada kind of whenever it's happened and someone has actually
*  Done something wildly unpredictable because they've had a psychotic response to cannabis it tends to make headlines
*  So it's not it's not common. I could not give you an actual number
*  But it's it's certainly not a frequent thing because we would hear about this a lot more if we did and there's also the issue of
*  Polypharmacology, which is simply when people take one drug then there's often the tendency to take another drug either because it's available
*  In those conditions or because their threshold to saying yes is a little bit lower
*  Do most people who take cannabis and achieve the the high?
*  Have a tendency to do other drugs. It doesn't seem like a drug that people combine with a lot of other drugs
*  I wouldn't say part. I mean there's certainly
*  Cannabis is used in tandem with other drugs alcohol psychedelics at times for sure. But that being said
*  I mean it's there is clearly a population of people that use cannabis as their only drug that they use
*  I don't think that's that uncommon
*  But in the context of the psychosis stuff, I would definitely say
*  Sure, I mean, you know if someone mixed it with amphetamine or something you could have a very unpredictable response
*  But I mean, I think the psychotic responses that have been documented that are usually purely due to cannabis like it's not it's not necessarily
*  Due to some kind of drug interaction there
*  There is something about
*  The way that cannabis is changing the way the brain functions in a way that for people who seem to be prone to this
*  They can have a psychotic response
*  I again, I don't think it's a very typical thing
*  But we're talking about what that means in the context of like an actual disorder like a chronic disorder like schizophrenia
*  Which is characterized by psychosis. I think we're talking about a whole different ballgame here. And this is an area that is I
*  mean, I think it's an important thing to discuss in the context of science because
*  You can't establish causality like in my view
*  It's it's virtually impossible because there's just no way to control all the variables that play into this what we can say definitively is
*  individuals
*  Who have schizophrenia? First of all, they use cannabis at a higher rate than the general population. That's very clear
*  Yeah, they definitely use cannabis at a higher rate than the general population
*  There is definitely a relationship between
*  Using cannabis and
*  having the
*  initiation of the development of schizophrenia
*  And this is where a lot of the statistics that have been used to develop the risk
*  Assessment essentially like so that you have a greater risk if you know
*  Like you were saying if you've used cannabis as a teenager use high potency as a lot of the research has shown
*  Though they've done these studies and they say it relates to
*  a greater risk of schizophrenia essentially
*  This is just a statistical assessment
*  This is just a statistical association that they found that people who use cannabis the conversion in the schizophrenia
*  Happens at a higher rate and there's more people schizophrenia who are using cannabis. Is there a bias towards males developing psychosis?
*  I know there may be a bias initially toward males in
*  Schizophrenia as that could confound this so we want to be careful to be honest and all the research I've and all the literature
*  I've read on this
*  I don't ever remember there being clear sex descriptions of the differences of males and females
*  I mean again historically cannabis was more used by males and females so that could
*  Lean towards any bias that may be out there in the media or the popular
*  Like just in general what people talk about
*  I can't think of any study that I've ever read that explicitly said this was you know, my male bias per se they usually just report
*  numbers or
*  proportions of people
*  The issue is
*  So yes, there's this relationship that exists and yes, we know that
*  Cannabis can trigger psychotic episodes. So if there's an individual who has schizophrenia
*  we know for certain that cannabis can lead to the onset of you know
*  Increases in positive symptoms like hallucinations and delusions
*  And a full-blown psychotic episode
*  So I think the first thing to say which is very clear is in my view if someone has schizophrenia
*  If someone has schizophrenia cannabis is contraindicated like you shouldn't be using cannabis if you have schizophrenia
*  I think that's a risk across the board. What about a first relative who has schizophrenia because there's a strong genetic component to schizophrenia
*  so I was gonna say then the next question is
*  Knowing who's gonna develop schizophrenia
*  Obviously, we don't know this and as you say the only real predictive variable that we know of is a first-degree family member that has schizophrenia
*  Means that you have a higher risk of developing schizophrenia. So again same with bipolar
*  I would say if there's bipolar or schizophrenia in a family to me. Those are the people who should avoid cannabis
*  Just in terms of the likelihood. There's a much greater likelihood that they'd have
*  It would relate to the onset of a disease or could accelerate its its presentation in some capacity. I
*  Think where things get really complicated
*  in this whole cannabis schizophrenia story is the causality and
*  There is a camp of people who have looked at this literature and definitively believe that cannabis causes schizophrenia
*  and they
*  Attribute proportion of people who have schizophrenia to only having that schizophrenia because of the fact that they used cannabis
*  And I think you'd had some discussion about this in the last podcast. I can't remember exactly the way that you described it
*  Yeah, I was looking toward some of the recent studies in
*  Lancet Jama psychiatry, I believe we can provide links to these again and now more recently there's been a lot of
*  Let's just call it mainstream media coverage of this potential. Yeah, I think it's the right way to refer to a potential linkage between
*  Adolescent teen and young adult use of high THC cannabis and
*  lasting psychosis
*  but the more I hear you talk about this the more I'm wondering if
*  That idea is being
*  Amplified more than then perhaps we ought to let it be amplified. I mean, I think this is what happens when you have I
*  Mean obviously you're familiar with this and science is different
*  There's some things that we can be a little bit more definitive about and then there's some things that we just can't know for certain
*  It's just the way it is because of the way that we gather data because of the way humans are and this isn't a question
*  I believe we can ask from an animal model perspective in the same capacity
*  So I don't think anyone would deny at least anyone who's read the literature that there's this relationship between cannabis use especially in adolescence in the development of
*  Schizophrenia now my perspective on this is and I'll explain why I have this perspective and how I justify it is to me
*  Cannabis is fuel on a fire. So if someone is prone to developing schizophrenia
*  Adding cannabis into the mix, I think will make it kick in faster and harder. So
*  if there is a genetic vulnerability for
*  For
*  Developing schizophrenia or some biological predisposition that's there. I
*  Would say in that situation cannabis can trigger an initial onset of the first episode and it can make the prognosis of the disease
*  In the long term a lot worse
*  Let's say as I recall and I may have this incorrectly but as I recall from my undergraduate
*  years
*  What you just said is also true for military service for people that have a predisposition to develop schizophrenia
*  That active military duty can exacerbate it as well. I mean, I've never heard that but that would be a stressor and stressors are other
*  ways, I mean a lot of you know, the situations where
*  I mean some of it's the age but like, you know
*  For example, if someone is prone to develop schizophrenia, they move way to college
*  Even that stressor can be something that brings on an episode but cannabis
*  very
*  Specifically like different than any other drugs like alcohol or cigarettes as far as I understand it at least the temporal relationship between
*  Cannabis use and the development of a first episode can be pretty linked
*  But the arguments that I've always had with people in this area who are very definitive on their end of the spectrum that this is a
*  causal relationship is
*  First of all
*  We have a few things that like I would leverage this kind of real-world evidence that makes this questionable
*  So the first one is like I was saying earlier in the episode
*  I mean, we really didn't have cannabis use in the West like as a normal thing
*  As one of the drugs that was part of the repertoire of what people use recreationally until like the 60s
*  So unlike alcohol which has like been there for centuries
*  We have a little bit of a before-and-after what we can look at the Grateful Dead. Yeah, so
*  Now granted we don't have like really good prevalence data of what schizophrenia was in the era prior
*  I mean even nowadays our prevalence data is not perfect
*  If cannabis is a solitary variable was driving the genesis of schizophrenia
*  Denovo in the absence of any kind of biological predisposition or genetic predisposition
*  I find it very hard to believe that we wouldn't have seen a shift in the prevalence of the disease as
*  cannabis became more mainstream and more widely used and
*  Generally schizophrenia rates have remained largely stable
*  People can make arguments about that better care other things that to challenge that argument sure so another modern perspective would be okay
*  Well, let's look at Canada in the States
*  Let's say where we have as I said earlier teenagers in Canada states by grade 12
*  35 to 40 percent of teenagers have at least used cannabis somewhat sporadically and somewhere around 5%
*  Ish are probably using almost daily. So we have a
*  Concentrated group of what it would be the high-risk population here that are using at a pretty high rate
*  And then we compare that to somewhere like let's say Norway or Sweden or any of the Scandinavian countries where cannabis is like not a thing
*  Certainly not at a recreational level and not teenagers and I mean the rate use rates
*  They are probably under 5% globally for teenagers like probably closer to 2 or 3 percent
*  So you have two countries that have pretty similar
*  social structures and other capacities of things were both Western countries and yet our
*  Schizophrenia rates prevalence wise are relatively comparable and yet in Canada in the states our cannabis use rates in adolescence are
*  Wildly amplified compared to those countries. So again if this was
*  Causing schizophrenia to develop as a disease out of nowhere
*  How would that not track like how would that not be seen when you just look at individual?
*  variances across countries and prevalence rates
*  Yeah, I I hear your point loud and clear. I seem to recall that there is a higher incidence of schizophrenia
*  independent of cannabis use
*  Closer to the polls, you know and less so at the equator
*  I don't know if those statistics still hold up, but I have no idea
*  Okay
*  I don't know interesting for us to look into that because then then it would argue that you know since
*  You know, we're comparing very northern locations to less northern locations that perhaps cannabis was you know, sort of exacerbating
*  They probably use Greece or Italy
*  I mean they're gonna have cannabis use higher than Scandinavian countries
*  But it's gonna be way lower than North America still because it's just what is it about North Americans and cannabis use?
*  I have no idea. I mean, I think it's just part of the culture here. It's just evolved totally differently
*  I'm grateful dead. No, I'm not picking on the great that I like the great
*  Well dead Rick Rubin convinced me to start listening to them again
*  And because my sister used to listen to them and there's some great songs and they're from Menlo Park Palo Alto
*  So I've done I've done my duty to listen is there some great songs
*  So I'm not picking on them
*  But I mean like you also have like in Europe though alcohol is also much more normal normal
*  In general like kids will drink it's not abnormal for kids where teenagers to drink out alcohol is just much more of a cultural thing
*  as well and
*  There are just differences. I mean, it's the same thing you look at like the opioid crisis that we're going through it
*  It's sure it's there to some degree in Europe, but it's nothing like it is in North America
*  We are just a different beast for a lot of drug use
*  Do you see differences between United States and Canada with respect to either cannabis or opioid use? I don't think dramatically
*  I think we're pretty comparable from I mean for cannabis rates. I would say they're almost the same
*  I've not seen sure you might get some regional differences like we I think Quebec has much lower rates of cannabis use than some other
*  parts of Canada and you guys probably in some southern states maybe are a bit different than other states, so I
*  I don't know about that. But again
*  Overall at a federal level, I think the which is where most of the data aggregates
*  I would say that they're pretty comparable with each other
*  So they're not they're not wildly different at all
*  and again
*  even if you talk about climate a lot of the US is a lot warmer than Canada and you guys are certainly closer to the
*  equator than we are so I
*  I mean we know like you do see higher rates of schizophrenia in urban settings than you do in rural settings
*  And so I mean stressor argument there's other you also have more like there's just yeah, there's a lot of
*  Transitory populations that come in and out of cities that you don't see as much in rural communities. There's a lot more mental health services
*  There's other variables that can influence that I'm no one's really I think sussed out a mechanism to explain why you see that but
*  So there are there are things that shift across places
*  But I don't think it has anything to do with the rates of cannabis use
*  and I mean
*  the other thing that became very interesting in this whole debate over the last 15 odd years that people have really been talking about this a
*  Lot more is the fact that there's also been several studies now that have done genetics either at the GWAS level or just even just looking
*  at
*  polygenic risk scores and
*  There's at least three papers I can think of off the top of my head that I could put the citations down for for sure after
*  this
*  that do
*  Look at this from and somewhat. Let's say unbiased perspective where they see, you know
*  There's some there's certainly some genetic architecture that relates to people either initiating cannabis use or people developing cannabis use disorder
*  And there's clearly some genetic architecture that relates to risk for schizophrenia
*  And what these studies have found kind of across the three of them was quite similar which was from their analysis
*  the the directionality suggested much more that having
*  Genetic risk for schizophrenia
*  predicted cannabis use
*  More so than cannabis use predicted the development of schizophrenia interesting
*  So what that would mean is that there is some underlying?
*  biology that might be shared between a
*  biological vulnerability to develop schizophrenia and
*  Some factor that relates to people using and or liking and or excessively using cannabis
*  I've spoken to
*  Many psychiatrists in an effort to find someone expert in ADHD
*  We've done two episodes on ADHD focusing on everything from behavioral to nutritional
*  But also prescription drug treatments for ADHD and what's interesting is that all of them have relayed the fact that?
*  Many people not just young people but adults with ADHD will often
*  Use not necessarily abused but will use stimulants like coffee and other forms of stimulants to a high degree
*  And then of course you can say well, perhaps the stimulants are causing ADHD
*  But they actually argue for the opposite which is that people are attempting to self-medicate
*  Yeah, and then it's perhaps no surprise that most not all but most of the medications that are approved for the treatment of ADHD are
*  variants of amphetamine or similar
*  so it it's another case where you know depending on whether or not you look through the lens of the drug leading to the condition or the
*  condition leading or through the lens of the condition leading to the
*  The use of the drug you can end up in two very different places, but it looks exactly the same
*  Through each lens so to speak
*  I think so
*  I mean and this is you know
*  I've debated with other researchers in the area in print and in person about the different interpretations of this and one of the possibilities
*  Is again the this idea of self medication?
*  I mean independent of there being some underlying biological thing that just is a third variable that explains the relationship between
*  Cannabis and schizophrenia the other possibility is self medication and there there are some studies that suggest this and others that don't support it
*  anecdotally from
*  Having done work in the community and talked to individuals who have schizophrenia who use cannabis what their perspective it on is
*  What I've heard from a few of them is
*  you know the medications that they're provided to manage the disease are
*  relatively effective at managing let's say the positive symptoms like hallucinations delusions that
*  Aspect of the disease is somewhat well managed, but then there's another component
*  Which is the negative symptoms which is kind of like things that they'll you know abolition, so I don't like engaging and stuff
*  there's some anxiety some depression some social withdrawal and
*  A lot of the medications don't manage that component of the disease
*  And they have said that they find cannabis helps that side of it or it helps them de-arouse a little bit
*  Even though a lot of them recognize it may trigger the development of some of the positive symptoms
*  They feel that they don't have any tool in their kit to manage the negative symptoms and so
*  It could be in my mind when I look at that it could be a bit of a vicious cycle
*  Where someone's using it to kind of band-aid one aspect but making other aspects of the disease worse at the same time
*  so it can get very complicated, but
*  So I mean there are various ways of looking at this in terms of you know
*  So it's either you could say there's a causal argument
*  Which is made by many saying cannabis causes schizophrenia and therefore if we eradicated it
*  I think you had alluded to something like that in the last podcast that if you removed it would have this big effect in
*  terms of reducing schizophrenia rates
*  and that's some of the argument that a lot of the researchers in Britain have made and
*  I'm not personally convinced of that and I say that simply because I look at the data from Scandinavia
*  And I'm like well there you have a population that barely uses any cannabis and yet their schizophrenia rates are the same
*  So the only way in my mind if I look at this kind of scientifically from a data perspective
*  That cannabis could be causing schizophrenia de novo in a subset of people is that there must be an equal proportion of people for whom?
*  For some reason and somehow cannabis is preventing them from developing schizophrenia
*  So that it's a zero-sum game at the end of the day and there's no change in rates
*  Like I can't actually understand any other model that could explain this. Yeah. No, I the way you you're explaining it now makes perfect sense
*  I do want to make sure that we distinguish between
*  schizophrenia
*  Like psychosis or schizophrenia itself induced by cannabis. Yeah and manic bipolar
*  Episode so people who have a predisposition or full-blown manic bipolar sometimes called manic depression
*  But that's you know, there's so a lot of nuance there
*  We did an episode about this that people can also find linked in the show note captions
*  But in any case is there any evidence for the fact that people who suffer from or have a predisposition to manic bipolar?
*  conditions like
*  Bipolar depression for instance should avoid high THC cannabis
*  So well first of all, I mean
*  For in like heredity family trees
*  For example where you look at something like bipolar schizophrenia the two do kind of track together sure
*  so it's not I mean, I think it's hard to separate these in some capacity because
*  You know, I remember years ago at Society for Neuroscience Glenn close was one of the I don't know if you were at that meeting
*  Yeah, she was one of the public speakers and she talked about
*  Schizophrenia and her family tree and she kind of put up this family tree of like, you know
*  her family and the one the previous relatives in her family and showed like
*  The individuals who had schizophrenia and bipolar as well. And this is something I think that's been seen a fair amount is
*  There is some co-relationship in the way that these track at a heredity level
*  And so I don't know that area really well enough to to be able to comment on and I'm from the cannabis perspective
*  Bipolar is definitely much less study studied and focused on than schizophrenia is but I think also to the comment about the high THC thing
*  I think this is the other
*  part of the argument that's emerged out of this and this is the other part where I see a lot of the
*  Causality arguments kind of crumble onto themselves to some degree and there's been others who've made these very similar arguments to what I'm making here
*  which is
*  The push that came out of this at the UK at least was much more that it's this high potency kind of skunk cannabis
*  They referred to which first of all was based on a smell which they didn't really hadn't done a lot of analytics on so
*  People make the assumption if it smells stronger, it's more potent cannabis. That's not really true because THC doesn't dictate the odor
*  That's so saying more of a terpene thing
*  But certainly I'm sure some of the skunk cannabis they were referring to is high potency cannabis
*  and so the analysis on this if you actually go back to those papers and read is they often use like hash or
*  Low potency cannabis is their control where they show no association with cannabis
*  And so that's what's used this argument that it's the high potency cannabis that has driven this
*  so now the problem with this argument in my view again, I look for what is the
*  Answer that fits in with the data like what's the most parsimonious explanation here that everything can be explained by and
*  So the problem with that argument is if you look at the cannabis schizophrenia literature
*  Everything goes back to this one 1987 Lancet paper out of Sweden where in that paper they essentially looked at
*  They have really detailed life records and health records and this was Swedish conscripts
*  And they essentially found that if someone had used cannabis the rate the risk of developing
*  Schizophrenia had gone up and up and so this was based on a cohort of people when it was published in 87 that the data would
*  Have been collected through like the 60s 70s early 80s
*  So we're talking about Sweden and cannabis
*  It's not a country that is high cannabis use rates and in an era when cannabis was hovering in a two to five
*  Percent THC range that was the initial
*  Finding that provided this association between it and yet the cannabis in that study that they would have been referring to would have been
*  Incredibly low potency compared to what has happened or like what it is today
*  So if the argument is that it's only related to high potency
*  How would that initial finding have ever been found because it doesn't make any sense whereas the alternate explanation that others have put forward
*  Which I agree with and is far more sound is that there is some
*  Biological reason why individuals were either prone to develop or who have schizophrenia like cannabis and
*  They will tend to seek out the highest potency product they can get access to so in the 70s in Sweden that would have been
*  two to five percent
*  THC cannabis
*  Nowadays, it's higher potency cannabis or maybe they seek out lots of different forms of recreational drugs and cannabis just happens to be one that
*  They land on which raises the other question which is
*  It's hard to imagine that these people who develop psychosis who happen to be using cannabis are only using
*  Cannabis it could be but I mean they also there's there's no question. There's a lot of nicotine consumption
*  I mean individuals with schizophrenia use they smoke a lot of cigarettes
*  I mean, that's also that's well much higher than the general population rate
*  Which is known to stimulate dopamine and other path and there could be other reasons, you know again
*  There may be some reason why they like it and I think this is
*  Something that I think we just don't understand
*  It's a very challenging thing to figure out why it is that individuals that have certain diseases may like certain substances
*  Is it is it?
*  Helping them. I mean some people have argued that perhaps nicotine for example might enhance cognition in
*  Individuals with schizophrenia and that may be why they like it. I think it enhances cognition in everybody
*  It just carries certain health concerns. Yeah, and by the way, it doesn't enhance all forms of cognition
*  But there there there is a nice body of work to support the idea that nicotine
*  Delivered in any number of different forms can improve cognitive function to some extent
*  But I don't suggest people run out and do it and in fact, it's one of the more
*  quickly
*  Abused drugs and nowadays because of the non smoking delivery routes that are becoming really popular pouches and things
*  In fact, I was chewing a little bit of Nicorette gum to kind of do an experiment
*  I liked it a lot and then I decided to stop completely recently because it just
*  It wasn't having the same effect and I found myself reaching for more and that's the time when I usually back out
*  Well, yeah, no nicotine is a whole other sure which I bet
*  We'll have you back to talk about I would definitely do not know enough about that to have any kind of informed
*  conversation but
*  So, I don't know I would say it to me at the end of the day if I put all the data together
*  what I would kind of
*  the perspective that I have on this is
*  For some reason be it genetic architecture or biological predisposition
*  individuals who are prone to develop schizophrenia also seem to be prone to use cannabis and use it
*  Possibly at excessive levels or possibly at higher potency products they seek out
*  Using cannabis if someone is prone to develop it may initiate or trigger the onset of the disease
*  and I think in the long term it will likely make the prognosis of the disease worse, so if you were a
*  psychiatrist in a clinic and you
*  Consistently see patients presenting saying I didn't have psychosis. I used cannabis now
*  I have psychosis and it converts into
*  Schizophrenia I can understand why the association would be made
*  regularly that there's kind of a domino effect here and
*  Causality becomes attributed but I think when we take a step back and look at the larger
*  Data in its kind of entirety to me
*  it's a very tricky argument to make because there's a lot of things that you just can't explain from that perspective and
*  This is also one of the things that I find absolutely bizarre about cannabis in general is
*  It's a wildly polarizing
*  topic of conversation and people have incredibly deep-rooted opinions on both sides of the spectrum and
*  For some reason if I don't say cannabis is the devil and causes disease that means I'm an advocate
*  And then on the other side of the coin if I don't say cannabis cures everything
*  I'm a prohibitionist so like I'm in this fun position where I get hate mail from both sides and
*  Everyone just generally depending on their perspective thinks that I have a bias kind of going in one way or the other and I'm very
*  You know want it this way or want it this way at the end of the day
*  I'm just like no I just like data
*  so I'm like I'm gonna try and answer things as best I can with that and to me that's the perspective I've maintained and
*  I do think that like these aren't trivial questions because when we went through the legalization process in Canada
*  This was something that came up again and again and again
*  was this association with schizophrenia and
*  In the UK this is something that comes up again and again and again
*  because whenever there's any discussion about the UK moving forwards legalization these ideas come back and so
*  the public health kind of consequence of this is not intangible and so
*  for people to be making these very strong causality arguments and having this kind of
*  Opinion that a lot of people just take up I
*  Think can have a lot of influence and so that's why like there's literally no reason I should have a dog in this fight
*  I don't study schizophrenia in any capacity
*  And it's not my area of research
*  But because I'm in the cannabis field I always feel very strongly that we need to maintain
*  Clarity over what the data says and not get caught in these
*  opinion based arguments and I feel like this is one of these areas that has just kind of
*  The amount of people I talk to that regularly tell me that they know that cannabis causes schizophrenia
*  They're terrified if someone uses it because it's gonna cause them to become
*  Schizophrenic I am just kind of shocked by so this is clearly permeated
*  You know the general population that there's a widespread belief of this
*  You know
*  I think it's because of these very high profile papers in the way those were picked up by traditional media
*  And this seems to be something that every couple of years. There's a resurgence of this idea
*  I'm clearly people are curious about it and so I just want to say thank you for clarifying
*  What is
*  Now to me obvious that it could be that there's a relationship there
*  It's clearly not the case yet
*  Yeah
*  And it may never be the case that there's a causal relationship there and it could just as well be that people who have a predisposition
*  To schizophrenia are seeking out cannabis use and engaging in cannabis use and I think that's a very important principle
*  For our listeners and viewers to just hear and understand anytime we're talking about a substance and a condition
*  Yeah, and I mean I think again this is again no endorsement that that doesn't mean that it's safe and that that's without harm
*  I'm just strong of the opinion that I don't think individuals with schizophrenia who are or who have you know first degree relatives should use
*  Cannabis because I think there's a high degree of risk there
*  But that's a very different argument than making saying cannabis causes schizophrenia and if we remove it from society
*  We'll see drops in rates of schizophrenia. I don't believe there's any evidence that actually could support that
*  So it's just a nuanced argument and this is a good thing about more of a long-form podcast is it allows for nuance
*  Yeah, absolutely
*  Let's talk about strains of cannabis. I've spoken before
*  about the sativa versus the indica strains and certainly there is a lot a lot a lot of
*  subjective anecdotal descriptions about differences in the
*  Quote-unquote effects of those as reported by users when I talked about this before in the cannabis episode. I
*  leaned on a paper that took those subjective reports of
*  arguably many many people
*  Push those subjective reports through what was known about the strains they claim to have used
*  So this is you know, people are reporting their use we assume honestly
*  But you always have to assume that there I guess people could be lying about which strains were misinformed
*  But and then using machine learning to couple their
*  subjective experiences as they report them to indica versus sativa strains and then
*  By looking at the chemical composition of those different products because these were products that they had consumed trying to attack chemical composition
*  to strain in this case that mainly the indica sativa
*  discrepancy to subjective experience and I know that you and
*  Presumably others in the field of cannabis research take real issue to that sort of approach and
*  Perhaps I have the the feeling this is what you're gonna say
*  Rest on the idea that we at least at this point in time really can't say anything about the different biological
*  Effects of sativas versus indica's and yet at the beginning of the episode you said that there are many many different cannabinoid
*  compounds in cannabis so
*  Three questions and I'll keep these very short one
*  Do you think that there are different subjective effects of different strains of cannabis that can be attributed to the different?
*  strains right not just to individual differences in experience and then the second is do you think that
*  There will ever be a time in which we can understand this plant flower
*  Right to the extent that we can engineer it to provide specific subjective experiences
*  Perhaps more positive than negative etc. And then there's a third question, but I'll hold off
*  Okay, so
*  Yes, so going back to
*  Just the idea with the indica sativa thing so
*  the indica sativa
*  Names at least from everything I've understood from everyone that I talked to and being in this field is it's those are botanical terms
*  That largely refer to shape of the plant the you know, the way the bud grows blah blah blah
*  They do not track with chemical composition in any way
*  in fact Nick Chakomis has done like a lot of
*  analysis of like thousands and thousands of
*  different kinds of cannabis cannabis that have been submitted for kind of biochemical analysis to understand THC CBD
*  terpenes minor cannabinoid content and
*  essentially
*  his his work as well as from all the people who have done the genetics on this is
*  The variability that exists within what someone calls an indica or sativa is
*  Greater than the variability that there is between them and there's no there is no such thing as a chemical
*  Profile that exists in something that's a sativa versus something that's an indica. Is it possible that there's a chemical profile that relates to the most common?
*  Indica's are most common sativas
*  I mean I think in Nick's analysis there was like a couple of
*  Terpenes that may have loaded on a little bit onto things that were sativas
*  But there was tons of sativas that didn't fall into that bracket. Okay, well then that immediately to me
*  Negates the sort of premise of this paper that I was referring to that divides according to indica sativa
*  And yet the paper is also trying to distinguish among all the different types or products of cannabis
*  Yeah
*  Meaning is there some other feature of the cannabis plant that does relate to these different subjective effects because people do seem to
*  Get different subjective effects from different products that relate in some way to things other than the concentration of THC
*  Yeah, I would my honest opinion is this is expectancy bias. This is all expectancy bias
*  I mean I see so they purchase something that they think is gonna make them calm and it makes them feel calm 20 people
*  Tell you that taking this makes you calm you cannot remove your expectation bias from the fact that when you consume it you feel calm
*  like and this has been I think one of the most common things with with cannabis is like this whole area is so ripe with
*  These expectancy biases that people have about
*  What they assume if you go someone goes into you know, and a bud tender tells them this is a sativa
*  It's gonna energize you there's no way to remove that expectancy bias from from what you get
*  And I mean like from talking to a lot of people that kind of study this more explicitly
*  They always say the biggest predictor of what someone feels when they consume cannabis is what they're told on the label
*  It's gonna do to them. I mean and it's pretty wild it speaks to you know
*  I did an episode on the placebo effect. It's a lot of people here placebo effect and they go, okay
*  Well, then everything's a place the placebo effect is amazing
*  There's dose response the placebo effect of nicotine on cognition
*  I mean those response if you're told you got a high dose when you actually got a low dose
*  You will exhibit the high dose neurocognitive enhancement effect and by brain imaging it shows a high dose like
*  Enhancement of the relevant brain areas in other words the expectancy drives changes in brain activity
*  The board I mean it's again. This is not unique to cannabis in any way
*  it's just cannabis is so ripe for this because of the like myth like the lore that it just exists like people
*  Say this I mean the issue has been
*  I
*  Just asked Ryan van der this as far as I know I don't believe there's actually ever been a clinical trial that has blinded people
*  And given them sativas or Indica's and actually had them predict what they are or been able to characterize
*  any kind of phenotypic description of what that intoxicated state feels like and
*  Because all the like the paper that you were referring to where it was users who had got the product
*  They can't remove their own inherent biases from their own experience. It's it's gonna it's gonna influence it
*  there's no way around it and so
*  people kind of lean into this and I
*  Probably not consciously, but they I mean the amount of people I've talked to that really
*  genuinely believe this to their core that sativa does this and Indica does this is
*  Fascinating to me because again like you have these two like THC is what drives the high that's very clear and you can take a
*  Sativa and Indica that have virtually identical levels of THC and yet people will report very different intoxicating states that come out of that
*  Do you think this also explains the?
*  Lore or perhaps it's real that different alcohols produce different drunks
*  You know, I mean I've heard of you know
*  I've got friends who will swear that whiskey makes them feel aggressive and vodka
*  You know is mellow and white tequilas feel different than yeah than the other tequilas and you know for people listening this
*  They go. Okay. Well, that's not science. I agree. That's not science. That's just anecdote. Yeah, and yet
*  You know the chemical composition of these different drinks is different but ultimately we're talking about alcohol
*  Different sugar contents, you know different hangover propensity. I mean I have to believe the majority that's an expectancy bias
*  I have a hard time believing that these things are really driven by fundamental biological differences within because anything else that's I mean, that's the thing like
*  Sure, some of the labs now there is a movement to start looking at can certain compositions of other things in cannabis
*  Start to maybe modulate or influence. This is called like I think I've said this before the entourage effect this idea that
*  THC alone might do one thing but then layering in other
*  Turpenes or minor cannabinoids may influence that effect. That is a theory
*  That's not a thing that we know definitively in any way. And in fact, there's virtually no research that's ever been done to test this
*  There's some stuff that's starting to come out now like Ryan Vandrie at Hopkins
*  Recently published a paper where they kind of in a dose dependent manner added limonene, which is one of these terpenes
*  Like I said, I think gives it like a citrusy odor into the THC and did find that a really high dose
*  Probably a dose that I don't think you could actually find in cannabis
*  It's a little bit higher than what you would have gotten there
*  But limonene did seem to be able to curb the ability of high dose THC to make someone feel anxious and this was done in
*  a blinded manner so
*  There's I think some validity to the interaction whether that's occurring in cannabis naturally because of the levels of THC to limonene
*  I don't know but it really was one of the first demonstrations that adding in a terpene could actually influence a
*  component of the intoxicated state in a in a blinded manner
*  I think is interesting and Zeva Cooper who's here at UCLA is doing some work with beta-cariophyllene, which is probably
*  Probably the second most abundant terpene I think from Nick Chakomis's work
*  I think Mersene may have been the highest prevalent terpene across all types of cannabis beta-cariophyllene is probably the second and limonene
*  I think is probably the third
*  and
*  So I think they I mean and so they're looking at I think Zeva's work is in the context of pain
*  So they're trying to look at if a fixed dose of THC if you add in varying levels of beta-cariophyllene
*  Does this influence this so because again you do see this in patient communities where they say well this strain helps my pain
*  Better than that strain and so it's like okay
*  Is there actual legitimacy to this or again?
*  Is this just an expectancy bias because someone who sold this to you told you that this strain is better for pain and
*  The problem is these are all subjective endpoints
*  I mean, this is like pain sleep anxiety
*  These are all how someone personally experiences it we know from all the clinical trials that study pain sleep and anxiety
*  There's massive placebo effects that happen in all these conditions
*  And so it's very difficult to actually make any kind of sound statements about this in the absence of there being
*  Kind of clinical trials that have clearly started to do this
*  But it's like as you can imagine when you start doing the math
*  Given the amount of terpenes the amount of combinations at different levels how overwhelming this could become
*  Because maybe you know there's a few that you need in there that interact with THC not just one
*  There is like a lot of work that's happened in the last few years that has really started to try and look at if these terpenes
*  Or minor cannabinoids act at the cannabinoid receptor which none of them seem to so this isn't like you've got things that modulate
*  How THC is binding to CB1 if they're doing something else? It's probably through an interaction with another chemical system
*  That's influencing what THC is doing
*  So I'm not against the idea that like different chemo bars or what people call strains of cannabis
*  Could do different things subjectively
*  I just am remiss to believe this until I see some blinded data because I think outside of that
*  We know how powerful an expectancy bias is so it makes it very very challenging to
*  Make any kind of firm statements and so
*  Kind of in the context of like how you introduce this that was
*  again, I think like one of the issues that I took with the other podcast was because as you've said I
*  Understand the thought process you went through like you know you had this paper where people were reporting subjective effects
*  There's some neuroimaging data that's been done with cannabis you kind of said okay
*  This is what that was and that was what sativa did and versus this is what indica did
*  So I think it's important that you explain that because I do think that like well
*  That's what the data pointed to but now what I'm realizing is that anytime we're talking about cannabis
*  because of the 70 plus cannabinoids present that could modify or
*  Join so work in parallel with the effects of THC. We're really talking about polypharmacology
*  It's not a pure substance. It's not like giving an and amide
*  Yeah, or it's not like you know adjusting levels of endogenous and an amide
*  You know this raises. I think an equally important issue for us to resolve which is
*  CBD which we didn't talk about earlier when
*  Nolan Williams who's a psychiatrist he's one of these phenoms triple board certified psychiatry neurology
*  Colleague of mine from Stanford School of Medicine who mainly works in Ibogaine and transcranial magnetic stimulation, but we talked about
*  Cannabis a bit when he was on the podcast and he mentioned a strain of cannabis
*  That is available in Colorado, which is pure CBD
*  And I think it's called Charlotte's web
*  And the parents of
*  Children who have epilepsy
*  Will move there or go there just to get this strain because it seems to help their epileptic
*  See, I mean, I would say that's definitely not true nowadays that pre
*  Legalization anywhere outside of Colorado. That was true. People were gravitating there towards it. Yeah, so the questions are
*  Could you tell us a little bit about the biology of the CBD receptor?
*  Mainly as it relates to CB one or not, you know, does it bind CB one as well?
*  If not, how is it working and you mentioned that people will not report any subjective effect of taking a pure CBD compound
*  So lacking THC, but it sounds like it may have some usefulness for treatment of epilepsy. And what are some other?
*  established meaning
*  clinical trials and or lab data to support the use of CBD for any type of either
*  You know psychiatric condition pain, etc
*  so, I mean the first thing that's interesting that I think a lot of people don't understand about CBD is
*  CBD like
*  Doesn't really exist in any form of street cannabis and it hasn't for a very long time meaning there's no CBD in there
*  There's some there's very very low levels of CBD and the reason that is is because
*  THC and CBD are both made from the same precursor molecule and which direction it goes in is based purely on which synthetic enzyme
*  converts it to either THC or CBD and so as
*  People have clearly chased THC and wanted cannabis that's rich in THC
*  And so cannabis has been bred to become higher content in THC by default
*  CBD has been bred out of the plant and it has largely been bred out of the plant for quite some time
*  and so
*  This I always find it interesting that there's this community that's like
*  Oh, well THC is the recreational cannabis and CBD is the medical cannabis and was like that's bizarre because historically
*  there's always been like THC has been what people have bred cannabis for and so
*  Kind of any medical benefits that people have reported from cannabis per se usually are THC and CB1 driven
*  CBD is this other molecule that we can go to the pharmacology in a second, but again, it's just it's I mean
*  I think in the in the analysis that Nick Chacoma state of all these strains and types of cannabis that exist
*  In the United States when they went through their thing of thousands and thousands of kinds of cannabis
*  It was like three percent of them maybe had like more than one percent CBD like it's very low like there's almost none and
*  In Canada to get a CBD rich strain
*  You have to basically explicitly buy it because it has to be bred to make CBD
*  And so this is the kind of chemo of our distinction
*  I think you did allude to this last time which is the type one type two types three
*  So type one is high THC type two is like somewhat balanced and type three is high CBD and now I think like
*  90 to 90 something low percent of all cannabis that are out there are type one like they're all high THC because that's what's been bred
*  There's a few that have been mixed
*  So are kind of equal proportions, but you're never gonna get high equal proportions
*  So like a high THC cannabis is like 20 to 30 percent if you go for type two, which is mixed
*  They're both gonna fall around 12 percent
*  Maybe a little more but in that range and then same if you got a type three, it's high CBD
*  It's gonna be 20 ish percent CBD and very low THC and so no one has ever kind of grown CBD rich cannabis outside
*  This recent boom in the last decade that's happened about people wanting CBD because of the Charlotte's Web, which was
*  popularized by I think Sanjay Gupta on CNN in like
*  2012 or something was a while ago, but that was what got a huge movement going around this idea of CBD and
*  Yeah, so the Charlotte's Web was like I believe that was what they had named that kind of cannabis that they'd extracted it from and so
*  It was this it was a tincture that they were using that was very high CBD content that they were finding was controlling
*  Pediatric seizures and kids now. This has actually been studied pretty effectively
*  Most of its come out of Boston
*  Elizabeth teal
*  Has been one of the main leads on this and she's a neurologist there that has done a lot of the work on this and
*  So they have I think very clearly and the data is incredibly compelling
*  Their research is one of the reasons why CBD has been de-scheduled or changed its scheduling down to a what is it five?
*  What is it class like?
*  What ebd yeah, like CBD I mean given the availability of CBD everywhere
*  yeah, in gummies and drinks and I mean you can get it in a
*  Convenience store. It's been kind of a lot of it's been like shifted in its classification status
*  Because it actually has been shown very clearly to have medical benefit and so in and it was very specific
*  It was a very specific form of pediatric epilepsy called Dravet syndrome. Now. I there's other forms of pediatric epilepsy
*  I know Elizabeth has studied in addition that has found comparable levels of efficacy
*  But essentially what they have shown is that like very high doses of CBD
*  are relatively effective at
*  Calming down the seizures and some kids it's profound like in some kids you're talking about kids that were having
*  dozens of seizures a day to essentially none and so
*  And I can understand. I mean, yeah, that's super impressive from a grassroots perspective
*  I can understand if you were a parent who had a child with a disease like this that was largely intractable and not
*  That well controlled from the medications they were on and then something came around
*  That showed this level of efficacy you would gravitate towards it
*  Like that makes sense to me and I think the work that Elizabeth and her colleagues have done has been really important to establish
*  the efficacy of this of CBD in these in these
*  Disease states and so I don't think at this point
*  There's a lot of controversy around that the question that comes out though is so how is it working?
*  And we don't have a mechanism
*  So as you had said like CBD receptor there is no CB like there's no receptor that CBD binds to I was under the impression that CBD
*  Also bound to the CB one receptor
*  No, I mean certainly not or that it or that under some conditions it can
*  modulate
*  The shape of the receptor to adjust THC binding, but now you're telling me that these two things rarely coexist together
*  So I guess the question you can dose them like you can certainly
*  I mean you can have products that are made that are like oil-based products at least that have a certain amount of CBD and
*  Certain amount of THC and people do go for those and there's this I mean one of the arguments people make is
*  They say oh introducing CBD reduces the adverse effects of THC and Mike
*  Well if you're using it in a strain, that's simply because the strain of cannabis has less THC now
*  It's impossible so you've bred it out
*  But I mean like a lot of this was based on some work that came out a long time ago from Brazil where they showed that
*  Like giving CBD with a relatively high dose of THC could curb some anxiety that came out from high dose THC
*  I thought the explanation for that was that
*  CBD can modify
*  The CB1 receptor in some way that makes THC less able to engage with the THC
*  There is some evidence to support that that like we would call these allosteric modulators
*  There's some evidence to suggest that CBD may interact with a allosteric site on the cannabinoid receptor that makes THC bind less
*  Doesn't sound like you're particularly convinced by that evidence
*  I mean like the
*  I'm looking at the look on your face with those listening. I'm looking at Matt and he's I think he's he's being generous here
*  Let me ask you something
*  He's being generous here. Let me ask it a little differently
*  Does anyone know what CBD binds to?
*  No, and so the most convincing thing that I've seen that CBD binds to is the work that C.C. Hillard has done looking at its ability to
*  Essentially block adenosine uptake and so it can inhibit the adenosine transporter
*  So that should make people feel more alert
*  No, because you're getting more adenosine so you get an accumulation it blocks the adenosine transport mechanism
*  I see so you get an accumulation of adenosine which is more sedative
*  and that I mean in the PNAS paper that
*  C.C.'s lab had from 2006 they showed that that also mediated it was the adenosine. I think 2a receptor that drove the
*  anti-inflammatory effects of CBD so it was the secondary effect by sort of the opposite of
*  Caffeine of caffeine. Yeah, I know if I'm ever doing the way you're describing this it sounds like the the anti-caffeine
*  That's kind of how I describe to people if they ever ask me for what the pharmacology of CBD is
*  I'm like that's not the only mechanism
*  But the thing that was important in cc studies that I think is relevant is that it was not super high concentrations of CBD that
*  caused that so you could get this adenosine accumulation at
*  You know, you're not talking like
*  Micromolar levels of CBD which is what a lot of studies have done
*  And so even when we're talking about the allosteric modulatory site like yes, there's evidence for it and it is convincing evidence
*  it's just the dose range in there you're kind of like
*  Who's getting hit with CBD at that level where you're getting these effects and more so
*  When they've done the blinded work like when Ryan van der Haapkins again
*  Who is one of the main people who's done a lot of this work has actually blindly given people CBD
*  Dosing with THC finds the opposite that it actually amplifies some of the effects of THC
*  And this was something we learned from the pediatric epilepsy world was that when you start giving CBD at relatively high doses
*  one of the things it does is saturate a lot of liver enzymes and so
*  Some of the efficacy in the pediatric epilepsy space may be a secondary
*  Effect due to an accumulation of some of the anti-epileptics as well
*  Because they're not being metabolized the same way and this has now been very well replicated
*  We know that once you start taking CBD when they hit doses that are at the clinical level
*  You're going to start having hepatic effects
*  So it's going to affect the liver and it's going to affect the ability of the liver to chew up other drugs
*  And there's very specific
*  Sip enzymes like the cluster of enzymes that metabolize things is very specific ones that CBD hits
*  And so as a consequence one of them is what choose THC up
*  So you can get a potentiation of THC by inhibiting its metabolism if you have high enough CBD on board
*  Given the effects on adenosine that you described before that it's sort of the what we're calling just for sake of discussion the anti-caffeine
*  How do we explain the preponderance of CBD added to energy drinks that also contain caffeine? There's like no logic there
*  There you go
*  Everything can't be expectant. I mean, I have a feeling it's gonna be interesting to see in the comment section on youtube
*  I mean presumably there's some um regular pot smokers
*  Uh listening to this and you know, the expectancy bias is so strong as I alluded to in the placebo episode
*  And we've been talking about here. Um, and yet
*  It's so strong that I think people will also be convinced that there are real differences between different strains because they've maybe done the you know
*  non-formal blind
*  You know someone someone gave them their their weed and someone else and then they got a completely different effect, right?
*  They're not expecting something. Um different necessarily
*  In a particular direction, but they get a very different effect. But that to me just speaks to the idea that
*  Again cannabis sounds like polypharmacology 70 different cannabinoids THC being among the more powerful
*  components, but it's um, it's yoked in the sense that
*  As you said people self-regulate their intake provided they're smoking not ingesting it by edible
*  And so it's almost like THC is being held constant and then there's this constellation of other things around it that are modified
*  And people eventually veer towards what they like what they can afford what works with their lifestyle and then they come up with a bunch of
*  theories based on packaging what they're told but
*  Presumably also some real effects of these terpenes the cbd component, etc. It can't all be just psychological
*  Yeah, I mean so what you're saying is like what we said is the entourage effect
*  And I think that is a theory that is held by a lot of people that this exists
*  I mean the reality is these terpenes and minor cannabinoids exist at such low levels that like there's a couple of
*  kinds of cannabis that might have like a high enough level where you're seeing something but
*  Yeah, I mean I agree to the extent that it would be a little wild if everyone's subjective experience across different kinds of
*  Cannabis was entirely driven by some kind of expectancy, which I can't imagine is accounting for all of it
*  But I think when we talk about
*  Sativa versus indica, I think there's a huge bias that's going into there
*  um
*  But one of the things with cbd that's interesting unlike thc is you can actually do pretty clean blinded studies
*  Because it's really hard to give someone thc and them not know they're on thc
*  Right. This was the big problem with the mdma trial that happened recently is that people who got the placebo
*  Knew they got placebo people got the drug knew they got the drug. It's very hard
*  You could do a dose response
*  But it's very it's very challenging to give someone a psychoactive drug and a placebo and them not know which one they have
*  Whereas because cbd doesn't produce an intoxicating state. It's not really
*  Perceptible from the person who's taken it
*  um that it's doing anything that actually does make it far more amenable to do blinded trials with and so
*  I mean the interesting thing with cbd and this is where I get a lot of people that get angry at me as well is that
*  I would argue that the overwhelming majority of the effects of cbd that people report are all placebo effects and I say that
*  because people leverage the epilepsy stuff and some of the clinical work and say but we know it does things and my response to them is
*  Do you know what dose those people are getting because this is something that for some reason has not made the transition from science into pop culture
*  This is a similar phenomenon with glp1
*  um
*  I and other people have pointed to the fact that certain food products or certain
*  Drinks or certain activities can increase glp1 gluglugon like peptide, which is now becoming more
*  commonplace knowledge
*  Because of ozempic monjaro, etc as very powerful weight loss tools, although there's questions about muscle loss, etc
*  and then we had
*  Dr. Zachary Knight on who explained that
*  Even a four-fold increase in glp1 brought about through a prescription drug or ingestion of a particular food or drink
*  Does not lead to any appreciable weight loss
*  However, when one achieves a thousand fold increases in glp1 through the use of things like ozempic monjaro
*  You see profound weight loss meaning that you need enormous effects
*  In order to see that the clinically relevant changes in in that case weight loss
*  So it sounds like a similar thing with with cbd
*  So if somebody um takes a cbd gummy and they feel that they sleep better
*  You would argue that that's entirely expectation bias
*  I think that's a placebo effect can I say that because the majority of gummies are about like two megs five megs 20
*  Megs, I've never taken a cbd product. I know a few years ago. They were all the rage
*  I just I was never tempted to do it
*  And i'm aware and we'll talk about this a little bit more that
*  There is evidence according to matt walker who did a six episode series with us on sleep that thc
*  Does help certain people fall asleep, but it can dramatically alter the architecture of sleep in ways that are probably not great
*  Yeah, yeah, I mean thc and sleep is definitely a whole other thing
*  But sure a lot of people report this with cbd
*  But again, so most cbd edibles or things that people take that are sold through commercial markets are in the range of two to
*  25 megs of cbd
*  So then I say to them
*  So you're aware that in the pediatric epilepsy studies the dose ranges are like
*  1500 to 2000 makes and then you're talking about a child
*  Who weighs on the order of what 20 kilos maybe, you know, like 40 60 pounds somewhere in that range versus
*  So if you start dosing by weight, which is how most these things are done. Well, they'll say 20 megs per cake or whatnot
*  um
*  so
*  Someone my size so I weigh a bit over 200 pounds for me to take
*  That dose of cbd
*  Uh, and let's say 20 megs per kig at like 90 odd kilos
*  I mean you're talking about me taking a liver damaging dose an insane. Well, maybe I wouldn't say damaging. Um, it's definitely
*  Influencing how the liver metabolizes other things because it's going to saturate those enzymes, but you're taking a very high dose
*  So if for instance you were to take a high dose of cbd and then maybe uh have a couple alcohol containing drinks
*  That could be problematic right because now you're talking about the two hit model
*  Yeah, I I can't speak to that because I actually do not know the metabolism of alcohol well enough
*  I don't believe so because that's alcohol dehydrogenase
*  So that would probably be a separate enzyme pathway than the sips. This is more like separate enzyme pathway, but you're but you're
*  Challenging the liver. Yeah, but I don't know if it would have an effect in that capacity
*  I mean, they've definitely seen this like they know the list of medications that this is a problem for so it's things like warfarin
*  Um and like blood thinners
*  And the anti-epileptics funnel into the same metabolic pathway as this thc
*  So there's certain things that this would influence
*  I don't know if I would say this would be in the context of alcohol, but
*  I think more so. I mean what I try and point out to people repeatedly is I have yet to see a blinded clinical
*  Study that has found any effect of cbd. That's efficacious. That's under
*  300 to 500 milligrams and
*  Yet in in the wild and people who are using it on their own
*  We're using doses of 10 to 20 milligrams and reporting these effects
*  And the thing is that I think a lot of people don't also realize is cbd has absolutely horrific bioavailability
*  Like so if you take it orally in a in an oil or in a gummy or whatever you consume it in now
*  This might be different with some of these beverages that are out there
*  I don't know if anyone's actually ever done the pharmacokinetics on them at least i've never seen it
*  Um, but standard routes we're talking four percent like very very little actually leaves your gut into your bloodstream
*  Now we do know from the studies from gw who created the pharmaceutical version of cbd that was used for a lot of the
*  pediatric epilepsy studies
*  That they did I don't know if it was random or intentional find that opposite to something like alcohol
*  If you had just eaten a fatty meal that actually enhanced the bioavailability of cbd dramatically
*  So then it went up to like maybe 20 got into the blood
*  But that's probably because again cbd is a fatty molecule
*  It likes fatty environments and for some reason having fat in the stomach
*  And then the gut seems to promote its ability to get into the bloodstream. You can see now. It's the steak in cbd
*  Or the the cbd with omelet
*  Protocol, i'm just kidding folks. I'm not i'm not suggesting that protocol
*  But yeah, I mean and so because of this it's like you're taking very low doses of cbd that have very poor bioavailability
*  And then people really stand by the effects of these and so i'm like, you know
*  what I would always say is if it works for you, there's no reason to stop it, but
*  Because you're having benefit from it, but would I ever recommend someone do this? No, I wouldn't because I I can't
*  Say that I think that this has any biological activity because even when we start looking at
*  These potential targets of what cbd could interact with there's a couple receptors people have said, you know
*  It might interact with serotonin receptor
*  There's some of these like random orphan receptors that we don't know a lot of what they do that cbd might interact with but like
*  the concentrations you need to hit those are
*  Reasonable and you're not getting that in the blood and certainly not in the brain of people from consuming incredibly low doses of cbd. So
*  The whole market that exists for cbd to me is is a little bizarre
*  And I think for a lot of us in the cannabis field
*  this has been one of the most bizarre social experiments we've ever watched because like
*  You know if you asked me in 2010 to walk into a room and ask how many people knew what cbd is like
*  Maybe one out of a hundred like no one knew what cbd was and now it's like 80 to 90
*  Would know what it is because everyone you can't walk down a street in any city in north america
*  And not see cbd products whether it's some kind of cream or like
*  a shake or some random like concoction that people have added cbd because now it's gonna
*  You're saying the energy drinks like it's just it's bizarre to me how much this has taken off because it seems to have
*  Somehow migrated into being a health product in some capacity. So yeah, i've never tried any of these cbd containing products
*  I think a lot of what you're describing speaks to the fact that um, you know people are
*  Eager for things that can help them adjust their anxiety and sleep better, you know, which is a large
*  Reason why a lot of
*  This podcast is focused on respiration based tools and other based tools that um can help people with anxiety
*  I think that many people suffer from um, just too much
*  activation in their autonomic nervous system and um that I I would argue there are much better things that are not of a
*  Ingestible type, you know things that one can do that are science supported right? There are clinical studies. Um
*  Meditation breath work any not so much breath work. I would argue but certain patterns of breathing meditation cognitive behavioral therapy
*  There are a whole bunch of different things as you know
*  Um, so I don't know what explains the cbd craze, but you certainly have shed light on what?
*  Is and mainly what is not known about cbd and I think it's really important for people to hear
*  Yeah, I mean again, it's I think from my point of view
*  It's an ethical thing as well because like this isn't covered by insurance people are spending their own money on this and so
*  I find it really challenging to recommend someone to be spending what can I mean if you're especially if you're talking about an actual clinical dose
*  I mean for someone to take cbd at the level where it could actually
*  Be shown to have some benefit in some condition of which currently it really is just pediatric epilepsy
*  Like this idea with sleep pain anxiety
*  There's not a lot of super conclusive data and i'd say most of the trials that have been done have not found
*  Really good evidence of benefit in any capacity. So it makes it very challenging to recommend this in any capacity
*  especially, I mean if someone if finances aren't an issue sure go for it, but
*  Um, you know, I understand people are like you say looking for solutions
*  So it doesn't sound like cbd is the solution
*  I would I I am not convinced by the data that exists that it's really doing what a lot of people claim it's doing
*  Except supporting the placebo effect, perhaps perhaps it's a great study of the placebo effect
*  I want to make sure before we close that we touch on
*  some of the potential harms or
*  Asserted harms of thc because I think there's a lot of misunderstanding about this. Uh, we talked about
*  Psychosis and the lack of evidence for a direct causal effect
*  Um, you give a beautiful description as to how we should think about all of that based on the current literature
*  but
*  cannabis and driving
*  Is a potential hazard. Yeah, right and some people will laugh they'll be like oh driving too slow as opposed to you know
*  Driving drunk or driving too fast. Okay, we can talk about that
*  Um, we talked about the potential for addiction and the evidence potentially for and against that right?
*  um
*  There's also this the big
*  Black or gray box of you know, all the things we don't know about what regular cannabis use could do
*  And yet I know a lot of people who've used cannabis for years
*  Mainly as a replacement for alcohol at least that's how they describe it
*  Well, it's not as bad as alcohol that you hear that a lot. Okay
*  But what are some actual if any?
*  What are some actual harms of cannabis use that people need to take into account and just weigh against the fact that
*  Every compound caffeine even water can kill you if you drink too much of it
*  um, and then let's make sure that we touch on this issue of cannabis and driving or operating machinery
*  But I think the machine most people are thinking about uh these days, um is driving. Yeah
*  so
*  health harms, I mean
*  Someone's smoking obviously there's risks for lung damage
*  I would say the evidence for things like lung cancer certainly don't hold the way they do with cigarette smoke
*  Because people are smoking less of it or there's just fewer carcinogens in there
*  I don't think you could make the argument about fewer carcinogens per se. I think probably it relates more to the frequency
*  I mean donald tashkin who's in california here. I think he was at ucla. I'm not 100 sure
*  But I know he was in california
*  He did like very long-term studies tracking cannabis smokers and basically did not find
*  Associations of lung cancer the way that you do with cigarette smoking why that's the case
*  I don't think anyone has like people have theories
*  Some suggest because a lot of this in vitro animal work with really high dosing suggests it could have anti-proliferative effects for tumors
*  Whether that's real or not. I don't know but like
*  I think more likely it's because most people who smoke cigarettes at least that were um
*  You know the relationship with lung cancer where people were smoking regularly throughout the day and it's very rare
*  Someone smokes cannabis at that frequency
*  Maybe if they isolated that population they would see relationships with lung cancer
*  I just don't think it's been born out by the data the same way certainly lung damage emphysema things like that are
*  On par is if you have any combustion product you're going to have damage there. There's no question about that
*  So again harm reduction perspective would be you know oral roots of administration bypass lung damage
*  They come with their own issues with dosing and whatnot, but
*  If you're talking about physical harms, that's one thing to avoid that you could bypass that aspect of it with
*  There is
*  some
*  I don't think we are at a point where we can say that the state of it. There is something with cardiovascular function and cannabis that
*  relates to
*  higher frequency of strokes perhaps or cardiac events in some capacity
*  The data is not entirely clear in this in this sense yet
*  I mean we don't see again
*  It's not like super clean relationships like we're seeing that we're there when they established, you know
*  Cigarettes smoking and lung cancer kind of thing
*  I think that effect was so profound and the population of smokers used to be so high it was can this um potential I want to highlight potential
*  relationship between cannabis use and
*  cardiovascular issues
*  be bypassed no pun intended by
*  Using edibles not inhalants or is it related to thc itself?
*  I would probably guess and this is a guess
*  That the in you know anything again combustion smoke wise, I mean maybe not vaping plant matter
*  but at least the combustion from smoking probably exacerbates this just because
*  Any kind of combustion product is going to have some vascular effects to some degree on the system
*  So I imagine we make it worse, but thc itself has a very complex effect on cardiovascular function because
*  It tends to cause
*  Typically vasodilation so you get widening of the blood vessels
*  Which is why it relates to a lot of people will experience postural hypotension
*  So sometimes when what that is is if you stand up and your blood pressure doesn't catch up with you
*  So you get really light-headed and people will collapse and so this is not uncommon to happen to people when and with edibles as well
*  So it's not just from smoking
*  Um, but when they've consumed cannabis in some capacity
*  There are some people that seem to be very sensitive to the vasodilating effects
*  And so when they stand up their blood pressure can't match the shifting gravity that happens
*  And so not enough blood perfuses the brain and they go down and that can be transient
*  They'll come to a minute or two later, but it happens
*  but as a consequence of
*  The vasodilation is is it triggers tachycardia, which is an accelerated heart rate. And so that's a very
*  reliable physiological response for a lot of people who use cannabis and so
*  It's a bit of a tricky thing because
*  Obviously if there is some underlying
*  Heart or cardiac sensitivity or issue
*  The tachycardia itself can be a problem. I mean so like um
*  You know if someone has like an underlying heart condition where at rest it may not present itself
*  But the shifts into that kind of beating faster to compensate for the fact that you've got a drop in blood pressure
*  um
*  Can do put strain on the heart in a way that could unmask a vulnerability or an event
*  And again, this is me theorizing what I think it could be based on what we understand to some degree about how it affects cardiovascular function
*  um
*  there are occasionally people who
*  Um have reported having like elevated blood pressure
*  I mean some of that also could be from like an anxiety state or whatnot coming around but
*  the typical response and this is usually driven by cannabinoid receptors that are in the um
*  the vascular beds themselves that it causes a vasodilatory response and so
*  That is usually the first step the second is the the uptick in the in the heart rate so you get these kind of
*  effects over time there's some work looking at like um
*  You know vascular stiffness that can evolve over time and cannabis users
*  There's some evidence to suggest that you might get more of that emerging
*  And so again that could relate to a vulnerability to have strokes or other kind of cardiovascular events in that in that sense. So
*  I think the issue in terms of like why it is more difficult for us to say anything definitively at this point
*  It's just obviously the the timeline of this. I mean
*  You know cigarette smoking was an easier thing to establish in that context because you know
*  Once antibiotics and medicine advanced in like the 40s and the 30s and stuff and people started living longer
*  You started seeing a lot of these effects of cigarette smoking emerge because yeah, it took a while for the um
*  Medical community to adopt the idea that cigarette smoking was bad. Oh, I know
*  I know
*  It's wild physicians would smoke in clinic the ashtrays in the doctor's office
*  I mean my grandparents grew up in belfast
*  They had smoked for years and they had even said like when they were younger doctors would say
*  I'll have a cigarette after a meal it promotes digestion
*  so it's kind of wild to hear that stuff when you think of how cigarettes are viewed nowadays, but
*  um
*  it is
*  I don't think we've we've kind of been able to track this long enough to be able to say with certainty what we're seeing
*  but I think there's
*  Like if people ask me about risks and harms of cannabis the the first thing I always say is you know
*  Schizophrenia and bipolar those are the main concern areas. I think where you want to avoid cannabis
*  And I would also say if anyone has cardiovascular issues
*  They should avoid cannabis just because that's more of like I would say being safe because I don't know how to actually explicitly say
*  What I would say the harms associated with it are but I think there is something there. I've seen enough evidence. That's like
*  Starting to coalesce into a story. That's like there's something here
*  so I would that's where I would say that I think there's risk there's also things like
*  This bizarre cyclic vomiting syndrome, which is this really strange thing that has become really apparent
*  Uh, we've seen this in canada a bit more now with legalization again because people are going into er's more where it's this somewhat
*  Strange phenomenon where it's usually people who are pretty excess cannabis users
*  They just start like puking and they can't stop it and it's like this intractable vomiting that they get into
*  And then bizarrely, um
*  Like one of the things that seems to cure it is a hot shower
*  Which is like I can't even begin to understand this
*  I mean there's also i'm chuckling at the example because you are so very clearly rooted in science
*  But that just came out of nowhere like okay cool hot shower deliberate deliberate heat exposure folks. There it is
*  I have been trying to understand how i'm not i'm not enjoying it because it's deliberate heat exposure
*  But it just speaks to the fact that we you know, we're talking about um
*  You know smoking being a regular part of the the medical community's behaviors up until you know a few decades ago
*  um, and then
*  You know a hot shower being the treatment for this like chronic vomiting and it it speaks to the fact that like with science and medicine
*  We do know a ton. It's amazing how much we've progressed is especially in the last hundred years last 25 years even
*  But it's also astounding how?
*  Um these seemingly surprising um antidotes to uh uncomfortable conditions can hold up over time with in the absence of any
*  Randomized controlled trials or mechanistic data. I mean, I I really struggled to understand because certainly
*  I don't think it was doctors that figured this out
*  This was people I think who were experiencing this and then they started telling doctors this and then I think
*  And I can only imagine i'm like maybe they're going in the shower because they're like vomiting on themselves
*  Probably and then inadvertently realized that being in a hot shower somehow seemed to calm this down
*  I have seen a study where they actually applied capsaicin cream and that also seemed to provide benefit something about activation of the
*  Heat thermal regulation because the other thing that seems to have shown some benefit is propanolol
*  Which again would suggest some kind of sympathetic which is a beta blocker. It's a beta blocker. So yeah, it's your effect
*  So there's something with autonomic it must be messing up some kind of autonomic balance or something with thermal regulation
*  Why that results in this kind of bizarre vomiting syndrome?
*  I have no idea
*  but I remember when I first started hearing the the stories of this years ago and I was just like how because I mean it is again
*  surprisingly counterintuitive because one of the
*  Medical uses that people have used cannabis for is as an anti-nausea and especially in the context of chemotherapy
*  and so something that typically has anti-nausea and quality suddenly triggering a vomiting syndrome is kind of a
*  Paradoxical and yet we started off today's conversation with you explaining beautifully how
*  activation of these
*  CB1 receptors are
*  Homestatic in some sense the thermostat analogy and you know, maybe after you know chronic use there's some you know
*  The seesaw sort of gets flipped to one side and gets stuck there
*  I think that's how most people have tried to kind of conceptualize
*  What's going on is maybe like and it seems to involve the insular cortex
*  At least the anti-nausea and defects of cannabinoids are involved through the insular cortex
*  And so maybe you like have burned out those receptors from chronic use
*  And so that endogenous mechanism isn't working or it's somehow flipped in the other direction now in that circuit becomes sensitized
*  But it is it is a very bizarre but very real thing that seems to happen again. This isn't common like I've
*  I've heard a couple of people I've met describe it but it's not like
*  It's happening to every 10th or 20th person or something
*  It's little it's a little more infrequent
*  But it's certainly happening enough that we've now captured it at a federal data level that this is a thing that people are showing up
*  In the air for so interesting it is a hot shower. Yeah, so apparently if it happens hot showers
*  So yeah, so for me, I would say that the the main
*  Harms that people need to be aware of the schizophrenia bipolar
*  possible cardiovascular effects and then this is one of these syndromes that can come out of it as well as possible lung damage from
*  Smoking those are the main I think genuine bona fide health issues associated with cannabis that people should be aware of
*  I mean and if you I mean, I know we're not gonna probably go into depth with it on the other side with the medical stuff
*  It's a little bit more challenging. I mean a lot of this is just because we really don't have
*  Good studies that have been done in any capacity that have really definitively told us of cannabis has like really bona fide medical benefit
*  Yeah, I was gonna ask you about that
*  It's always nice to end on a positive side and you know, we don't want to demonize cannabis nor do we want to glorify it
*  I but you know the examples that I've heard of medical uses for cannabis include appetite stimulation. We talked about that
*  for glaucoma lowering eye pressure and glaucoma that age and
*  age-related increase in eye pressure
*  Are two of the major risk factors for glaucoma, which is the most common blinding disease
*  Second to cataract more than 70 million people suffer from it everybody regardless of age get your eye pressures checked
*  There are drops for this but okay cannabis can reduce eye pressure and glaucoma
*  Nausea you mentioned and then anxiety it sounds like if people get the
*  The dose right and it's right for them that in some cases it can help them with their anxiety
*  and the reason I raised that one is because
*  It seems that most people who decide to use cannabis regularly are using it as
*  Perhaps for its euphoric effects
*  But as a kind of a mild sedative a way to relax in the same way that they would use a glass or two of wine
*  What are your thoughts on that because I think this is the most common use case
*  I mean you look at I mean the other one that wasn't on there
*  But you've mentioned this before and I have as well as pain so chronic pain
*  pain is I would say the number one so pain is certainly the one that there's the most amount of evidence for and
*  Thank you. I
*  Would say when you talked about this in the previous podcast you were mostly correct about this component of it in the sense that
*  It's not that cannabis is a profound analgesic. It's that
*  Cannabis it has some analgesic properties, but it's not like super sledgehammer in that sense
*  But what it does seem to do is it seems to strip away the affective component of pain to some degree
*  And so what I have consistently heard from chronic pain patients when they use cannabis is they say yeah
*  My pain is still there
*  But now the pain's background noise so I can sleep at night and just being able to sleep
*  I think is actually providing a huge amount of the benefit to that community
*  But it's the day-to-day like they're able to function with the pain because it doesn't
*  They don't become focused on it the same way because they're able to kind of push it to the background that seems to be the main
*  Ability of cannabis. I mean, yes, there's some mild analgesic properties to it to some degree
*  But it really seems to be much more of that component of and I think you'd alluded to something like that in the previous podcast
*  You'd said something about how it's changing the emotional state of pain
*  so and we know from the biopsychosocial model of pain that emotions and interpretation of
*  The sensation of pain is a huge component of what people refer to as chronic and acute pain
*  Yeah
*  so so the pain thing I think is is a central one and that's one of the only ones that there's a little bit of
*  Actual research on most of its either with isolated THD
*  I think there's one or two studies that have actually looked at smoke cannabis and found small signals of benefit. But so
*  Anxiety is is an interesting one
*  And so I mean obviously this is more near and dear to my heart because I study stress and anxiety as my primary area and
*  cannabinoids and endocannabinoids in that space
*  And yeah, you look at questionnaire based
*  studies about why people smoke cannabis and like 85% of them will say because it reduces stress and it makes me feel less anxious
*  I mean that was like a big impetus as to why we started studying
*  Endocannabinoid regulation of it because similar to feeding and pain where we know endocannabinoids are involved in regulated feeding circuits and
*  Endocannabinoids are also integrated into pain circuitry and can provide some endogenous analgesic signals
*  We figured the same was gonna be true for stress and anxiety which to some degree it is
*  But it's very complicated because it can be like I said before by phasic where some you know lower doses are anxiolytic higher doses
*  Can promote anxiety but for the majority of people who use cannabis regularly?
*  It's because it helps reduce anxiety now whether that would hold weight in a clinical trial is a different story
*  There is some old evidence from like I'd say the 70s early 80s where they were using
*  Synthetic forms of THC like nabolone which is some of you can get in Canada or maranol or dronabinol
*  Which I think is what's accessible in the states where they did find some evidence to suggest it was on par with like a benzodiazepine
*  Like diazepam or something. I can't remember exactly what the comparator they'd used there, but there was some evidence for
*  There being some anti-anxiety properties of THC and that tracks generally well with
*  The self-reported literature that's out there
*  Now whether that's the same as an ability to have benefit in something like PTSD is a different question
*  It gets a little bit more complicated because obviously PTSD has an anxiety component to it, but there's a lot more to it as well
*  And again, there's very little research in this space. There was one really really small
*  Study done by the Canadian military
*  First they did one version of it. That was an open label open label trials for people who don't know
*  It's just basically everyone knows what they're getting it's not blinded in any way
*  but because of the self-reported data from the veteran population about
*  Cannabis helping especially with sleep and the big thing that they reported was that it suppressed their nightmares. And so
*  You know post-traumatic stress disorder is a very complex disease for many reasons and one component of it is the
*  re-experiencing events that happen during sleep where there's a lot of nightmares and individuals will kind of
*  re-experience the trauma that led to the development of the PTSD
*  and there does seem to be some suggestion that because they're remembering it and maybe changing the details because they're in a
*  dreamscape space that they
*  Re-consolidated a little bit more and there's often a high degree of sympathetic activation and arousal that goes on with these
*  nightmares and
*  Some of the belief is that this is part of the sensitization process that can happen in
*  PTSD where the disease can worsen over time because the
*  re-experiencing and the
*  Re-consolidation and the sensitization of the disease that happens over time in this kind of sleep state can make it worse. And so
*  The majority of veterans who have used cannabis and report benefit if you actually talk to them about it
*  As I've done in a few different situations and also just look at the anecdotal data almost all of it talks explicitly about sleep
*  And they say oh we you know, we use cannabis or THC before bed
*  We find we don't have the nightmares and just the simple trickle-down effect of that is hugely beneficial for them
*  And so the Canadian military did an open label trial on this again not blinded
*  It was small numbers, but they basically found soon as they put people on nabalone this
*  Synthetic version of THC it vary in like a large proportion
*  I think like 85% of them almost stopped having these nightmares and this was a like a treatment resistant population that was pretty severe
*  So this was a big benefit
*  So they then took the open label and did what you should and moved forward to do a double blind placebo controlled now
*  It was a very small sampled studies and that is obviously always a problem with human work is if this was like 15 or 17 people
*  So not powered enough to really make any kind of firm conclusions
*  But interesting in the sense that at least it was done in a proper crossover design where they got placebo at one point
*  They got nabalone one point. It was switched. They didn't know which one they were on
*  Because they're taking it right before bed
*  Maybe that will remove some of the subjective bias again
*  You can't totally remove it
*  but like if someone's taking it within you know an hour or so of going to sleep they may not feel the high the same way but
*  even under the double blinded conditions, they found a very effective suppression of the
*  Nightmares and the re-experiencing and then they also at the same time found this increase in kind of quality of life measures
*  Which tracked with the fact that they were probably sleeping better
*  I don't think they actually reported any change or even looked at maybe the overall PTSD score
*  They only reported are really focused on the nightmare component of it because that was the primary outcome of the study
*  But so I thought that was interesting because that's if you look at the anecdotal data in PTSD
*  that's where a lot of it is focused on is the using it as kind of I wouldn't maybe call it a sleep aid because it's
*  really more of a
*  Modulator of the dream state and I think presumably because it's reducing the amount of rapid eye movement sleep you're getting which most people will
*  Probably hear and interpret as bad, but you know REM deprivation is actually one treatment for depression. So there are certain
*  case conditions where
*  Dreaming and REM is not advantageous and you're describing depression and PTSD are both two disorders that are
*  Characterized by changes in REM like they have earlier onset to REM so they go into REM faster
*  They tend to have some altered architecture of the REM component of their sleep
*  So in those states, maybe suppressing REM isn't actually a bad thing at least certainly for
*  PTSD I would imagine in terms of the context of the nightmares
*  That's providing some benefit whether or not it globally is is changing the disease severity or improving the disease
*  I don't think we really have any evidence to say
*  but again, I can understand the
*  the desire for people to kind of self-medicate let's say by using this as an approach to try and
*  Reduce that component of their sleep so they sleep better. They feel better
*  Maybe you know, maybe down the road it would help the prognosis of the disease long term if it's not sensitized in the same way
*  But I don't think we have any strong data that we can leverage in that capacity to be able to say it
*  But to me, it's one of the more interesting areas. I think
*  anxiety disorders in general
*  There's definitely some potential. So as I'd mentioned earlier
*  The the FAU inhibitor that elevates anandamide levels so Johnson & Johnson did do a trial in social anxiety disorder
*  It's published I think from a few years ago at 21 or something. I can pull up the reference for that where they did find
*  Some benefit it wasn't huge and some of this had to do with the design of the study because they kind of underdosed the
*  patients a bit and so not everyone actually showed the elevation in anandamide when they went back and looked but when they actually
*  Isolated the group of people that had higher anandamide in that proportion of the patients. They did see some symptom improvement
*  So it did support it and this is I mean very similar like for us
*  This is a big thing because all of the work that we focused on is looking at how stress and stress hormones regulate
*  Largely anandamide signaling and the main and one of the main things that we've demonstrated that's been replicated relatively well over the years is that
*  stress exposure
*  Can actually cause a rapid loss of anandamide signaling and it's that loss of anandamide signaling that seems to
*  Facilitate some synaptic strengthening in the amygdala and promote activity in areas that are involved in these anxiety circuits. And so
*  The thought has always been while of anandamide, you know, it's that job is it's kind of tonic housekeeper at keeping these in that homeostatic range
*  Let's say we're talking about explicitly an anxiety circuit, you know
*  There's individual variation that exists in humans across everything
*  So one of our predictions has been maybe people who are on the high end of the anxiety spectrum might be on the low end
*  of their tonic anandamide signaling spectrum and we've gotten a little bit of support from that from animal work where we've screened animals based
*  On anxiety and looked at endocannabinoid levels in the amygdala and found lower anandamide. That's extremely interesting because it squares with my
*  Again non laboratory observation that a lot of people use cannabis
*  To deal with their anxiety. Yeah, right. So what you're saying is that you know, there's a range of kind of let's just say
*  baseline circuit activation within the amygdala and related structures in mice and humans presumably in other animals also
*  if
*  People take a compound that adjusts the sort of homeostatic
*  Level of what's considered low moderate and high activation of those circuits that include the amygdala then perhaps they're bringing their anxiety into range
*  Yeah in a way that perhaps is different than with alcohol, which is more acute, you know, people have a couple drinks
*  They'll feel relaxed, but then there's this phenomenon of anxiety, you know the next day
*  Feeling a little anxious when they're not drinking whereas
*  It's interesting that many people who use cannabis for this purpose are not using it all day long
*  They are perfectly able to wait until the night time or evening and of course people can wait for their happy hour for a drink
*  as well
*  But it's far and away different than the way we envision something like alcohol use disorder where somebody
*  Discoveres that alcohol really helps with their anxiety and then they're drinking, you know
*  Maybe one at lunch maybe a couple at dinner and then in the evening to fall asleep at night
*  I'm describing extremes here, but I find your hypothesis to square really well with the real-world observations
*  Yeah, and it's an interesting one there is some evidence actually support so my buddy such Patel who's at Northwestern now
*  But he was at Vanderbilt when he did this study
*  They basically played with these drugs that you can use to prevent endocannabinoid synthesis
*  so you can create a state of like
*  impaired endocannabinoid function and
*  Humans and they did this in rodents. Okay, so this was done in mice and they basically but the one of the questions was is
*  So a does like, you know reductions in endocannabinoid function produce states of anxiety and they did demonstrate that so you could deplete
*  Endocannabinoid levels and you got the emergence of an anxiety state
*  So then you could give drugs that would boost the endocannabinoids to normalize this
*  So again, it kind of fit with the idea
*  But then they did one key study where then they gave THC and saw could THC fill in the gap and they found that like
*  boosting endocannabinoids giving THC on a background of low endocannabinoids was able to
*  Reverse that anxiety phenotype and bring it back into more of the normal range. So again
*  Maybe for some people this is if this again, this is theoretical
*  So I don't know how much of a spectrum there is if there are people that are at this low end
*  But certainly I think from the animal literature there's some foundation for making a theory that's similar to what you're saying
*  Which is maybe some people are
*  Trying to fill in a gap of something that's deficient in them and therefore that can help them feel less anxious and that again may be
*  Very different than someone who is like, you know, very anxious for different reasons or has normal endocannabinoid function or something else might be a play there
*  So very interesting. Yeah, I think I could explain some of the heterogeneity that exists out there for sure
*  Yeah, so perhaps genetic differences in sort of baseline levels of anxiety
*  Perhaps mapped to endogenous levels of an andamide and might predict propensity for THC use. Yeah
*  I mean we have definitely found in human populations through work
*  I've done with a lot of clinical collaborators and others like, you know
*  We look at endocannabinoids in the blood and it's not in the brain
*  But they are lipids that can move pretty easily back and forth
*  And we have found relationships between peripheral endocannabinoid levels and mood states both anxiety and kind of depressive measures
*  Which does you know somewhat relate to?
*  The possibility that this could be real. We don't know
*  It's it's it's been hard obviously for various reasons to really track this but we've never looked at an anxiety disorder population
*  We've done some work with post-traumatic stress disorder populations
*  There's been working depression populations that have found some relationships that are pretty similar
*  So it's certainly a possibility, but again, this is all like our theory at this point
*  So we'll see as things kind of move forward if they pan out. But yeah
*  Fantastic and I really appreciate that you're able to share some of what your laboratory is working directly on now and looking into the future
*  And I want to thank you for what has been an incredibly clear
*  Precise and in many cases actionable whether or not it leads to a yes or a no
*  Actionable information here because cannabis and CBD as you pointed out are kind of everywhere around us
*  yeah, and people are making decisions about
*  cannabis and CBD and
*  I also want to thank you because
*  What initially started off as a bit of a confrontation online which I alluded to in the introduction that I gave
*  has now evolved into a collaboration that I'm certain based on the
*  exquisitely clear and generous information that you've provided has led to
*  Better education more clarity and therefore better informed choices for all the people listening and watching
*  So I really truly appreciate you coming out here sitting down with me discussing these issues
*  clarifying points that were unclear before
*  And and also point into the fact that this is a complex system a complex biology
*  You know, there are a lot of things about psychosis about negative effects about potential
*  positive uses of cannabis that just are not yet clear and
*  Thanks to excellent researchers like you are likely going to be clarified in the years to come. So
*  Thank you ever so much for your time for your research and
*  For your attention to the public health education effort around cannabis. Thanks, and I think it's also important
*  I think it's good as you had said that like for people to see that scientists can have disagreements. I think it's important
*  I think it's good that you kind of provided me an opportunity to correct the record
*  And did so in a very appropriate manner. I think this was a great discussion for people to understand
*  different perspectives also good to highlight
*  Where it was that I had had issue with your previous podcast and I think the discussions that came out of that were for the better
*  So that's all the best and hopefully if there's other contentious issues that happen down the road similar things
*  Move forward you chat with people. Oh, I always yeah
*  if somebody who is expert in a particular area takes issue with something specific and can substantiate it with something that
*  Can foster better understanding
*  Without fail I'll reach out to them now how quickly we're able to get them here
*  Etc is always an issue. Sometimes we can put an addendum to a podcast nowadays. That's easier using
*  What's called dynamic insertion where we can go back and actually make a correction?
*  But listen the best situation is always when this podcast can mimic the real world of research science as you and I both know
*  To exist where if we had been in a meeting and you presented data
*  I presented data and we disagreed what we would probably do would be to head
*  well traditionally would be to the bar, but we'd grab a cup of coffee or go for a walk and we would
*  Talk about it hash it out and then
*  Potentially bring it up again at the next meeting
*  So in some sense what we've done here over the last month or so and certainly during today's podcast is to do something
*  To that effect. So and I think it's really good for people in the public to know this is how science progresses
*  This is you know, someone says something someone disagrees with it
*  You get an opportunity to clarify things and I think that that's really good just to move things forward
*  So I think that was a good process that we've gone through
*  Yeah, likewise and it's certainly within the spirit of the podcast in no way shape or form. Do I?
*  purport to get everything right and where I've made mistakes
*  I really strive to correct them and listen it's been a real honor and privilege to have you out here
*  Thanks for coming all the way from Canada
*  And I do hope to have you back again as the research evolves and we can learn more about these topics and more so thank you
