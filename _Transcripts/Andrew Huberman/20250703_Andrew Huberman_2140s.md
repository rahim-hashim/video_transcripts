Video Description: In this Huberman Lab Essentials episode, I explore major depression, including its underlying biology and discuss science-based approaches to alleviate symptoms and improve mood.
I describe the wide-ranging symptoms of depression and explain how key neurotransmitters, hormones, stress, genetics and inflammation contribute to its development and persistence. I also cover treatment options, from traditional classes of antidepressant medications to emerging therapies such as ketamine and psilocybin. Finally, I highlight lifestyle-based tools, including exercise, supplementation and dietary strategies that can help manage depressive symptoms and promote mental well-being.

# Understanding & Conquering Depression | Huberman Lab Essentials
**Andrew Huberman:** [July 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY)
*  Welcome to Huberman Lab Essentials, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=0.0s)]
*  where we revisit past episodes [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=2.44s)]
*  for the most potent and actionable science-based tools [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=4.48s)]
*  for mental health, physical health, and performance. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=7.66s)]
*  I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=11.78s)]
*  and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=14.44s)]
*  Today, we're discussing depression. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=17.28s)]
*  In particular, we're going to talk about major depression. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  The phrase major depression is used to distinguish [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  one form of depression from the other, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=24.72s)]
*  the other one being bipolar depression. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=26.8s)]
*  Major depression impacts 5% of the population. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=29.68s)]
*  That is an enormous number. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=34.32s)]
*  That means if you're in a class of 100 people, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=36.8s)]
*  five of them are dealing with major depression [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=39.44s)]
*  or have at some point. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=41.72s)]
*  Look around you in any environment, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=43.8s)]
*  and you can be sure that a good portion of the people [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=45.28s)]
*  that you're surrounded by is impacted by depression [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=49.2s)]
*  or will be at some point. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  So this is something we really have to take seriously [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=53.92s)]
*  and that we want to understand. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=55.78s)]
*  It is the number four cause of disability. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=57.96s)]
*  A lot of people miss work, miss school, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=61.24s)]
*  and before then likely perform poorly in work or school [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=64.18s)]
*  due to major depression. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=68.08s)]
*  So let's talk about the things that are present [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=70.24000000000001s)]
*  in somebody that has major depression. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=73.16s)]
*  First of all, there tends to be a lot of grief. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=76.12s)]
*  There tends to be a lot of sadness. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=79.56s)]
*  That's no surprise. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=80.8s)]
*  There's also this thing that we call anhedonia, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=82.18s)]
*  a general lack of ability to enjoy things. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=84.8s)]
*  For the time being, we want to frame up anhedonia, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=87.58s)]
*  this lack of ability to achieve or experience pleasure, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=90.44s)]
*  a kind of a flat affect as it's called. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=93.66s)]
*  Sometimes even delusional thinking, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=96.53999999999999s)]
*  negative delusional thinking, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=99.34s)]
*  and in particular, anti-self confabulation. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=100.94s)]
*  What is anti-self confabulation? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=104.94s)]
*  Well, first of all, confabulation is an incredible aspect [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=106.53999999999999s)]
*  of our mind and our nervous system. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=110.0s)]
*  You sometimes see other forms of confabulation [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=112.06s)]
*  in people who have memory deficits, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=115.32s)]
*  either because they have brain damage [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=117.26s)]
*  or they have age-related dementia. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=119.08s)]
*  A good example of this would be [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=122.06s)]
*  someone with age-related dementia [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=123.54s)]
*  sometimes will find themselves in a location in the house [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=125.62s)]
*  and not know how they got there. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=129.64000000000001s)]
*  And if you ask them, oh, what are you doing here? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=131.46s)]
*  They will create these elaborate stories. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=134.16s)]
*  Oh, you know, I was thinking about going to the shopping [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=136.14000000000001s)]
*  today and I was going to take the bus [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=138.3s)]
*  and then I was going to do, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=140.92000000000002s)]
*  they create these elaborate stories. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=141.76s)]
*  They confabulate. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=143.26s)]
*  It's as if a brain circuit that writes stories [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=144.58s)]
*  just starts generating content. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=147.42000000000002s)]
*  In major depression, there's often a state [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=150.78s)]
*  of delusional anti-self confabulation [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=152.78s)]
*  where the confabulations are not directly [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=155.68s)]
*  or completely linked to reality, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=158.96s)]
*  but they are ones that make the self, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=161.22000000000003s)]
*  the person describing them, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=163.9s)]
*  seem sick or in some way not well. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=165.58s)]
*  A good example would be somebody [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=169.9s)]
*  who experiences a physical injury, perhaps. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=171.18s)]
*  Maybe they break their ankle, maybe it's an athlete [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=173.74s)]
*  and they also happen to become depressed. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=175.86s)]
*  And you'll talk to them, you say, how are things going? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=179.22s)]
*  How's your rehab? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=181.02s)]
*  And they'll be, oh, it's okay. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=181.86s)]
*  And I don't know, I'm just, I feel like I'm getting weaker [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=182.68s)]
*  and weaker by the day. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=185.10000000000002s)]
*  I'm just not performing well. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=186.5s)]
*  And then you'll talk to the person that they're working with, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=187.86s)]
*  their kinesiologist or whoever the physical therapist is [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=190.68s)]
*  and they'll say, no, they're actually really improving. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=194.06s)]
*  And I tell them they're improving, but somehow they're not, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=196.0s)]
*  they're not seeing that improvement. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=198.38s)]
*  They're not registering that improvement. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=199.78s)]
*  They are viewing themselves and they are confabulating [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=201.6s)]
*  according to a view that is very self-deprecating [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=205.35999999999999s)]
*  to the point where it doesn't match up with reality. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=209.35999999999999s)]
*  The other common symptomology of major depression [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=212.2s)]
*  is what they call vegetative symptoms. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=216.56s)]
*  So vegetative symptoms are symptoms that occur [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=219.92s)]
*  without any thinking, without any doing [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=223.48s)]
*  or without any confabulation. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=226.26s)]
*  These are things that are related to our core physiology, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=227.66s)]
*  things like constantly being exhausted. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=230.28s)]
*  The person just feels exhausted. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=233.22s)]
*  They don't have the energy they once had. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=235.64000000000001s)]
*  So it's not in their heads. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=238.3s)]
*  Something is disrupted in the autonomic [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=240.4s)]
*  or so-called vegetative nervous system. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=242.44s)]
*  And one of the most common symptoms [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=244.48s)]
*  of people with major depression, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=246.32s)]
*  one of the signs of major depression is early waking [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=248.12s)]
*  and not being able to fall back asleep [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=252.48s)]
*  despite being exhausted. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=254.48s)]
*  So waking up at 3 a.m. or 4 a.m. or 5 a.m., [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=256.72s)]
*  just spontaneously and not being able to go back to sleep. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=260.12s)]
*  It's well known that the architecture of sleep [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=263.92s)]
*  is disrupted in depression. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=267.5s)]
*  What's the architecture of sleep? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=269.36s)]
*  Early in the night, you tend to have slow wave sleep [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=271.08s)]
*  more than REM sleep or rapid eye movement sleep. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=274.28000000000003s)]
*  As the night goes on, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=276.58s)]
*  you tend to have more rapid eye movement sleep. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=277.44s)]
*  That architecture of slow wave sleep [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=279.82s)]
*  preceding rapid eye movement sleep [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=282.36s)]
*  is radically disrupted in major depression. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=284.8s)]
*  In addition, the pattern of activity in the brain [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=289.8s)]
*  during particular phases of sleep is disrupted. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=292.18s)]
*  And then there are some other things [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=295.08s)]
*  that relate to the autonomic nervous system, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=296.34000000000003s)]
*  but that we normally think of as more voluntary in nature. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=298.96000000000004s)]
*  And these are things like decreased appetite. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=302.74s)]
*  So you could imagine that one could have decreased appetite [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=305.36s)]
*  because of the anhedonia, the lack of pleasure from food. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=309.36s)]
*  So you can see that the symptomology of major depression [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=312.62s)]
*  impacts us at multiple levels. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=315.84000000000003s)]
*  There's the conscious level [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=317.7s)]
*  of how excited we are generally. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=319.02s)]
*  Well, that's reduced. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=322.06s)]
*  There's grief, there's guilt, there's crying. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=323.24s)]
*  But then there's also these vegetative things. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=326.46s)]
*  There's disruptions in sleep, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=328.53999999999996s)]
*  which of course make everything more challenging [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=329.78s)]
*  when we're awake. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=331.74s)]
*  We know that sleep is so vital for resetting. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=332.58s)]
*  You're waking up early, you can't get back to sleep. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=334.91999999999996s)]
*  That's going to adjust your affect, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=336.82s)]
*  your emotions in negative ways. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=340.76s)]
*  We know this. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=342.26s)]
*  And appetite is off. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=343.44s)]
*  And there are hormones that get disrupted. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=344.84s)]
*  So cortisol levels are increased. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=347.38s)]
*  In particular, there's a signature pattern of depression [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=349.58s)]
*  whereby cortisol, this stress hormone [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=352.52s)]
*  that normally is released in a healthy way [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=355.2s)]
*  only in the early part of the day [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=357.64s)]
*  is shifted to late in the day. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=359.82s)]
*  In fact, a 9 p.m. peak in cortisol [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=362.64s)]
*  is one of the physiological signatures [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=365.42s)]
*  of depressive-like states. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=368.9s)]
*  It's not the only one, but it is an important one. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=370.74s)]
*  So let's just take a few minutes [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=374.04s)]
*  and talk about some of the underlying biology [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=375.8s)]
*  that creates this cloud or this constellation of symptomology. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=378.48s)]
*  One of the most important early findings [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=383.36s)]
*  in the search for a biological basis of depression [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=386.2s)]
*  was this finding that there are drugs [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=390.36s)]
*  that relieve some of the symptoms of depression. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=393.12s)]
*  Those drugs generally fall into three major categories, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=397.12s)]
*  but the first set of ones that were discovered [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=400.68s)]
*  were the so-called tricyclic antidepressants [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=403.52000000000004s)]
*  and the MAO inhibitors, the monoamine oxidase inhibitors. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=406.96000000000004s)]
*  And these tricyclic antidepressants [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=412.24s)]
*  and the MAO inhibitors largely worked [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=414.44s)]
*  by increasing levels of norepinephrine in the brain, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=418.52000000000004s)]
*  as well as in the body in some cases. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=422.72s)]
*  They were discovered because of the exploration [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=425.08000000000004s)]
*  for drugs that alter blood pressure. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=427.72s)]
*  Norepinephrine impacts blood pressure [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=431.04s)]
*  and drugs that lower blood pressure [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=433.62s)]
*  reduce levels of norepinephrine. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=436.92s)]
*  And that in many cases was shown to lead to depression [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=439.0s)]
*  or depressive-like symptoms. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=443.0s)]
*  These tricyclic drugs and the MAO inhibitors [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=444.92s)]
*  actually increase norepinephrine. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=448.08000000000004s)]
*  And frankly, they do quite a good job of relieving some, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=450.36s)]
*  if not all of the symptoms of major depression. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=454.40000000000003s)]
*  However, they carry with them many side effects. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=457.98s)]
*  Some of those side effects are side effects [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=460.76s)]
*  related to blood pressure itself [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=463.15999999999997s)]
*  by increasing noreadrenaline, norepinephrine as it's called, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=464.56s)]
*  you raise blood pressure, that can be dangerous. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=467.48s)]
*  But they also have a lot of other side effects. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=469.92s)]
*  The reason they have other side effects [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=473.32s)]
*  is because they impact systems in the brain [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=475.02s)]
*  and in the body that impact things like libido, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=477.4s)]
*  appetite, digestion, and others. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=481.08s)]
*  They made some people so uncomfortable [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=484.0s)]
*  that they preferred not to take them, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=485.44s)]
*  even though when they didn't take them, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=486.96s)]
*  they had a worsening or a maintenance [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=488.84s)]
*  of their depressive symptoms. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=490.7s)]
*  A decade or so later, there was the discovery [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=492.28s)]
*  of the so-called pleasure pathways in the brain. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=494.82s)]
*  This pleasure pathway, as it's sometimes called, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=497.59999999999997s)]
*  involves areas like the nucleus accumbens [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=500.38s)]
*  and the ventral tegmental area. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=502.59999999999997s)]
*  These are areas of the brain [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=504.47999999999996s)]
*  that are rich with neurons that make dopamine. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=505.88s)]
*  And if you think to the symptoms of depression, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=508.79999999999995s)]
*  of anhedonia, lack of pleasure, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=511.55999999999995s)]
*  a lack of ability to experience pleasure, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=513.3199999999999s)]
*  well, that was a smoking gun [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=515.88s)]
*  that there's something wrong [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=518.44s)]
*  with the dopamine pathway in depression. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=520.0s)]
*  So it's not just norepinephrine, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=522.8000000000001s)]
*  it's also the dopamine or pleasure pathway [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=524.1600000000001s)]
*  is somehow disrupted. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=526.5200000000001s)]
*  And then in the 1980s, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=527.6800000000001s)]
*  there was the discovery of the so-called SSRIs. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=529.2800000000001s)]
*  Most people are now familiar with the SSRIs, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=531.96s)]
*  the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=534.2s)]
*  The SSRIs worked by distinct mechanisms [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=537.36s)]
*  from the tricyclic antidepressants and the MAO inhibitors. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=540.9200000000001s)]
*  As their name suggests, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=545.0s)]
*  SSRI, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=546.12s)]
*  prevent serotonin from being wiped up from the synapse [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=549.96s)]
*  after two neurons talk to one another. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=555.36s)]
*  What do I mean by that? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=557.28s)]
*  Well, here's some very basic neurobiology 101. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=558.16s)]
*  If you don't know any neurobiology, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=560.88s)]
*  you're going to know some in about 15 seconds. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=562.52s)]
*  Neurons communicate with one another [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=565.42s)]
*  by spitting out chemicals into the little gap between them. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=567.48s)]
*  The little gap between them is called the synapse. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=571.48s)]
*  Those chemicals bind to the neuron on the opposite side [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=573.76s)]
*  and cause changes in the electrical activity [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=577.24s)]
*  of that neuron on the other side of the synapse. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=579.64s)]
*  Serotonin is one such neurotransmitter, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=582.7s)]
*  or more specifically, it's a neuromodulator. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=585.46s)]
*  It can change the activity of large groups of neurons [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=588.12s)]
*  in very meaningful ways. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=590.92s)]
*  Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor means [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=592.3199999999999s)]
*  when a person takes this drug, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=595.8s)]
*  some of those drugs include things like Prozac or Zoloft, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=598.48s)]
*  the more typical names or more generic names [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=601.56s)]
*  are things like fluoxetine. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=603.7199999999999s)]
*  When people take those, more serotonin hangs out [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=605.52s)]
*  in the synapse and is able to be taken up [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=609.04s)]
*  by the neuron on the opposite side [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=611.5s)]
*  because of this selective reuptake inhibition. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=613.9599999999999s)]
*  It prevents the clearance of serotonin from the synapse [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=618.7399999999999s)]
*  and thereby more serotonin can have an effect. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=623.1199999999999s)]
*  So SSRIs don't increase the total amount [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=625.92s)]
*  of serotonin in the brain. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=629.0s)]
*  They change how effective the serotonin [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=630.6s)]
*  that's already in the brain is [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=633.72s)]
*  at changing the activity of neurons. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=635.84s)]
*  About a third of people that take SSRIs [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=639.36s)]
*  don't derive any benefit. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=642.36s)]
*  It doesn't relieve their symptoms of depression. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=644.16s)]
*  However, for the other two thirds, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=646.44s)]
*  there's often a relief of some, if not all [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=648.2s)]
*  of the symptoms of major depression. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=650.6s)]
*  The problem is the side effects that accompany those SSRIs. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=652.6s)]
*  And so these days, SSRIs are a complicated topic. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=656.6s)]
*  It's sort of what I would call a barbed wire topic, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=659.86s)]
*  but these drugs also have saved a lot of lives. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=661.9s)]
*  They've also improved a lot of lives. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=664.32s)]
*  The issue is that they tend to have varying effects [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=667.3000000000001s)]
*  on different individuals [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=670.66s)]
*  and sometimes varying effects over time. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=671.58s)]
*  So they'll work for a while, then they won't work for a while. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=673.84s)]
*  There are also a lot of mysteries about the SSRIs [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=676.26s)]
*  and those mysteries bother people. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=679.3000000000001s)]
*  SSRIs increase the amount of serotonin [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=681.38s)]
*  or more specifically, they increase the efficacy [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=684.62s)]
*  of serotonin at the synapse. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=687.4s)]
*  That happens immediately or very soon [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=689.54s)]
*  after people start taking SSRIs, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=692.18s)]
*  but people generally don't start experiencing any relief [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=694.3s)]
*  from their symptoms of depression [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=697.02s)]
*  if they're going to experience them at all [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=698.62s)]
*  until about two weeks after they start taking these drugs. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=701.38s)]
*  So it's very clear that there are [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=704.26s)]
*  at least three major chemical systems in the brain, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=706.54s)]
*  norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=709.66s)]
*  that relate to and can adjust the symptoms of depression. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=712.5799999999999s)]
*  And those actually can be divided into separate categories. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=716.98s)]
*  So for instance, epinephrine or norepinephrine [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=720.0600000000001s)]
*  is thought to relate to the so-called psychomotor defects. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=723.9000000000001s)]
*  This is the lethargy, this is the exhaustion, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=727.2600000000001s)]
*  this is the inability to get out of bed in the morning. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=729.98s)]
*  Dopamine is thought to relate to the anhedonia [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=732.6600000000001s)]
*  or I should say lack of dopamine in depressive patients [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=736.22s)]
*  is thought to lead to the anhedonia, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=739.62s)]
*  the lack of ability to experience pleasure. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=741.82s)]
*  And serotonin is thought to relate to the grief, the guilt, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=745.28s)]
*  some of the more cognitive [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=750.0799999999999s)]
*  or more emotional aspects of depression. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=751.52s)]
*  So we've got the norepinephrine system [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=754.8399999999999s)]
*  related to activity and alertness, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=756.4399999999999s)]
*  the dopamine system relating to motivation, pleasure, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=758.6s)]
*  and the ability to seek and experience pleasure, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=761.78s)]
*  and then the serotonin system that's related to grief. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=764.16s)]
*  And unfortunately, brains and organisms don't work [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=768.04s)]
*  in a simple mathematical way where you just say, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=771.3199999999999s)]
*  oh, well, this person's experiencing a lot of grief, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=774.1600000000001s)]
*  but they don't have any problems with lethargy. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=776.44s)]
*  And so let's just boost up their serotonin. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=780.12s)]
*  On paper, it works, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=782.0s)]
*  but oftentimes it doesn't work clinically. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=782.98s)]
*  A really good psychiatrist will work with someone [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=785.12s)]
*  to try and pull and push on these various systems [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=786.8000000000001s)]
*  to find the combination of drugs that may be [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=789.36s)]
*  or may not be correct for them. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=792.1600000000001s)]
*  So next I'd like to talk about hormones [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=794.36s)]
*  and how they relate to depression. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=796.0s)]
*  And I'd also like to talk about stress [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=798.12s)]
*  and how it relates to depression, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=799.96s)]
*  as well as talk about some of the genetics [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=801.6s)]
*  or the predispositions to depression. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=803.66s)]
*  20% of people that have major depression [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=806.9399999999999s)]
*  have low thyroid hormone. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=809.64s)]
*  And that leads to low energy, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=811.8199999999999s)]
*  low metabolism in the brain and body. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=813.8199999999999s)]
*  Sometimes a psychiatrist will prescribe thyroid medication [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=816.78s)]
*  to increase thyroid output in people that are depressed, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=820.68s)]
*  and that will work to relieve the symptoms. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=823.1999999999999s)]
*  So there are certain situations or conditions [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=825.12s)]
*  that can impact the thyroid hormone system [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=827.62s)]
*  and make people more susceptible to depression [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=830.62s)]
*  or make a preexisting depression worse. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=833.16s)]
*  And those are things like childbirth. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=835.36s)]
*  So it's well known that women who give birth [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=837.8399999999999s)]
*  can often undergo what's called postpartum depression. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=839.8399999999999s)]
*  And that's thought to be hormonally related, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=842.6s)]
*  either directly to the thyroid system [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=845.04s)]
*  or perhaps to the cortisol system as well. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=847.64s)]
*  We'll talk about cortisol in a moment. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=849.4399999999999s)]
*  As well, certain women during certain phases [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=851.12s)]
*  of their menstrual cycle experience symptoms [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=853.64s)]
*  that are very much like clinical depression [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=856.62s)]
*  and oftentimes are diagnosed [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=859.4399999999999s)]
*  with clinical depression appropriately. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=861.44s)]
*  And of course, the menstrual cycle is associated [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=863.8000000000001s)]
*  with shifts in hormone levels. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=865.36s)]
*  As well, menopause and postmenopausal women [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=866.72s)]
*  are more susceptible to major depression, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=870.32s)]
*  regardless of whether or not they've had [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=873.1600000000001s)]
*  that major depression earlier in their life. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=874.46s)]
*  So these are things to be on the lookout for [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=876.08s)]
*  and to definitely talk to a doctor and get a blood panel [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=877.84s)]
*  that hopefully includes measures of thyroid hormone [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=880.84s)]
*  and cortisol hormone. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=883.36s)]
*  Why cortisol hormone? [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=884.36s)]
*  Well, more stress is correlated with more bouts [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=885.48s)]
*  of major depression across the lifespan. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=888.9s)]
*  How many bouts? [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=891.5s)]
*  Well, it turns out that as you go [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=892.34s)]
*  from having one to two to three, [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=895.14s)]
*  well, when you hit four to five bouts [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=896.98s)]
*  of really intense stressful episodes in life, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=899.3s)]
*  these tend to be long-term stressful episodes, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=902.38s)]
*  your risk for major depression goes way up. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=904.9399999999999s)]
*  And that's because the stress system [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=907.9399999999999s)]
*  is associated with the release of cortisol. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=909.5799999999999s)]
*  The cortisol system can dramatically impact the way [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=911.62s)]
*  that these different neuromodulators, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=914.34s)]
*  dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin function. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=916.24s)]
*  One of the more important reasons [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=918.78s)]
*  for learning how to counter stress [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=920.78s)]
*  in order to offset depression [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=922.3399999999999s)]
*  is that there is a genetic predisposition [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=925.16s)]
*  that certain people carry to become depressed. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=927.74s)]
*  How do we know? [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=930.02s)]
*  Well, in what are called concordant monozygotic twins. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=930.86s)]
*  So these would be identical twins [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=935.04s)]
*  for which one of those twins goes on [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=937.0799999999999s)]
*  to have major depression. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=939.0s)]
*  There's a 50% probability that the other one [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=940.0799999999999s)]
*  will have major depression. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=942.5s)]
*  So it's not 100%, it's not 100% inherited. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=943.66s)]
*  It's not 100% genetic, as you might say, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=947.22s)]
*  but there's a much higher predisposition for depression. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=949.9200000000001s)]
*  Whereas in fraternal twins, that number drops. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=954.72s)]
*  And in siblings, that number drops to about 25%. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=958.5600000000001s)]
*  And in half siblings, it's about 10%. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=961.6800000000001s)]
*  Basically, the more closely related you are [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=964.38s)]
*  to somebody who has major depression, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=966.38s)]
*  the more likely it is [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=968.62s)]
*  that you will also get major depression. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=970.2s)]
*  And therefore, if you haven't gotten major depression, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=971.6600000000001s)]
*  the more likely it is that you should take steps [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=974.26s)]
*  to learn to mitigate stress [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=977.76s)]
*  because stress is the major factor [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=979.8s)]
*  that can trigger one of these depressive episodes. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=981.28s)]
*  So next, I'd like to talk about some of the tools [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=983.84s)]
*  that people who both have depression [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=985.88s)]
*  or who are prone to depression, [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=988.76s)]
*  as well as people who don't have depression [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=990.24s)]
*  and simply want to maintain a good mood, [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=991.68s)]
*  who want to maintain a positive affect [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=994.2s)]
*  and pursuit of things in life, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=995.98s)]
*  what are the things that you can do? [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=997.56s)]
*  Any behavioral tool that adjusts the levels [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=998.86s)]
*  of a particular chemical ought to, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1001.58s)]
*  perhaps, provide some relief [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1003.46s)]
*  for some of the symptoms of major depression. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1005.36s)]
*  Let's take an example that I've talked about before [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1007.6s)]
*  on the podcast, which is, if you get into a very cold shower, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1010.48s)]
*  you take an ice bath, you will release norepinephrine [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1013.12s)]
*  and epinephrine in your brain and body. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1016.1600000000001s)]
*  There's no question about that. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1017.8000000000001s)]
*  If some aspects of depression are related [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1019.12s)]
*  to low levels of norepinephrine, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1022.2s)]
*  will taking cold showers relieve your depression? [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1024.24s)]
*  Perhaps, it might even relieve certain aspects [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1027.68s)]
*  of that depression. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1030.0s)]
*  Will exercise help? [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1030.84s)]
*  Well, if you go out for a run, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1031.8799999999999s)]
*  you're going to increase the amount [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1033.56s)]
*  of norepinephrine in your body. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1035.02s)]
*  If you enjoy that run, it's likely that you'll increase [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1036.9599999999998s)]
*  the levels of dopamine and probably serotonin [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1040.24s)]
*  in your brain and body as well. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1043.02s)]
*  Will that cure your depression? [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1044.74s)]
*  Well, there are a lot of studies exploring [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1045.86s)]
*  how exercise can impact depression, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1048.06s)]
*  and indeed, regular exercise is known [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1049.8999999999999s)]
*  to be a protective behavior against depression, [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1052.4199999999998s)]
*  but it also can help relieve some [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1057.1799999999998s)]
*  of the symptoms of depression. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1058.54s)]
*  So you may ask yourself, why would you need drugs at all? [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1060.34s)]
*  Why would there be prescription drugs [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1063.3s)]
*  or the need for supplementation or other things [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1065.3999999999999s)]
*  to alleviate the symptoms of depression? [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1067.4599999999998s)]
*  Ah, well, that's the diabolical nature of depression, [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1069.4599999999998s)]
*  which is if people are far enough along [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1072.78s)]
*  in this thing, this sometimes called disease, [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1076.4199999999998s)]
*  sometimes called disorder, but major depression, [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1079.3s)]
*  oftentimes they can't get the energy to even get up [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1082.5s)]
*  and take a bath or a shower. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1086.36s)]
*  They have no motivation to do it. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1088.7s)]
*  They have no desire to go for a run, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1090.98s)]
*  but it's very important to highlight the fact [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1093.14s)]
*  that these circuits that are accessible to some of us, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1094.9s)]
*  the circuits for happiness, for pursuit of pleasure, [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1098.5s)]
*  for exercise, for getting in a cold shower, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1101.14s)]
*  if that's your thing, that those circuits are present [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1105.82s)]
*  in all people, but for certain people [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1109.22s)]
*  that are experiencing major depression [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1112.0s)]
*  and are really in the depths of their depression, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1113.6200000000001s)]
*  they can't really access those circuits in the same way [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1116.42s)]
*  that people who are not suffering from depression can. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1120.0600000000002s)]
*  But let's look at depression from the standpoint [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1123.38s)]
*  of a deeper biological phenomenon, [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1125.5800000000002s)]
*  which is inflammation and the immune system. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1127.7s)]
*  There's growing evidence now [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1130.74s)]
*  that many forms of major depression, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1132.6200000000001s)]
*  if not all of them, relate to excessive inflammation. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1134.7s)]
*  Now, inflammation plays an important role [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1139.8200000000002s)]
*  and wound healing is that it is a positive aspect [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1141.5600000000002s)]
*  of our immune system, our ability to combat wounds, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1144.9s)]
*  combat illnesses, et cetera. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1149.3400000000001s)]
*  But inflammation gone unchecked, [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1151.46s)]
*  inflammation that lasts too long [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1153.9s)]
*  or is of too high amplitude, meaning too many cytokines [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1155.44s)]
*  and things of that sort in the body is bad. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1159.18s)]
*  And there's decent evidence now [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1161.7800000000002s)]
*  that inflammation can lead to or exacerbate depression. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1163.7800000000002s)]
*  And that if we want to control depression [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1168.18s)]
*  or limit or eliminate depression, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1170.22s)]
*  that focusing on reducing inflammation [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1172.58s)]
*  and its associated pathways is a really good thing to do. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1176.02s)]
*  And I think this is a really good thing [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1178.6999999999998s)]
*  for everybody to do regardless of whether or not [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1180.6999999999998s)]
*  you suffer from depression or not. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1183.1399999999999s)]
*  So first of all, who are the major players [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1185.1399999999999s)]
*  in creating chronic inflammation in the brain and body? [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1188.9399999999998s)]
*  They are the inflammatory cytokines, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1192.22s)]
*  things like IL-6, interleukin-6, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1194.54s)]
*  things like tumor necrosis alpha, TNF alpha, [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1196.98s)]
*  things like C-reactive protein, all right? [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1201.26s)]
*  When we are stressed, chronically stressed, [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1204.54s)]
*  we get inflamed, our brain and various locations [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1207.3799999999999s)]
*  in the brain become inflamed because certain classes [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1210.42s)]
*  of cells, in particular, those glial cells, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1212.54s)]
*  the cells that are typically thought [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1215.18s)]
*  to just be support cells, those cells [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1216.94s)]
*  and their biochemistry and their dialogue [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1219.28s)]
*  with the neurons of the brain and body [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1221.1s)]
*  starts to become disrupted. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1222.94s)]
*  It turns out there is a set of actions [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1224.98s)]
*  that we can take in order to limit inflammation. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1228.22s)]
*  One of those approaches is to increase our intake [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1231.46s)]
*  of so-called EPAs or essential fatty acids. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1235.38s)]
*  Increasing our intake of these essential fatty acids [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1238.38s)]
*  and in particular, the EPA variety of omega-3s [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1241.18s)]
*  can lower the effective dose of things like SSRIs. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1246.04s)]
*  The threshold level seems to be about one gram, [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1251.04s)]
*  a thousand milligrams of EPA. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1254.28s)]
*  So you will sometimes see on a bottle of krill oil [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1256.44s)]
*  or fish oil or any other source, even plant source [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1259.64s)]
*  or other source of EPA that it's a thousand milligrams [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1263.28s)]
*  or 1200 milligrams. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1268.14s)]
*  But what's really important to look at is whether [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1269.64s)]
*  or not there's more than a thousand milligrams of EPA [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1272.24s)]
*  because the EPA in particular is what's important here. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1276.0800000000002s)]
*  So how would this work? [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1278.7s)]
*  These inflammatory cytokines act in a variety [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1280.06s)]
*  of different ways, but they mainly act [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1282.78s)]
*  to inhibit the release of serotonin, norepinephrine [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1284.92s)]
*  and dopamine or the synthesis of serotonin, [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1287.5s)]
*  norepinephrine and dopamine. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1291.5s)]
*  Dopamine also called 5-HT essentially derives [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1293.18s)]
*  from a precursor called tryptophan. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1296.6000000000001s)]
*  Tryptophan arrives into our system through our diet. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1299.4s)]
*  Okay, tryptophan is an amino acid. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1303.26s)]
*  Tryptophan is eventually converted into serotonin. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1305.5800000000002s)]
*  However, if there's excessive amounts of inflammation, [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1308.66s)]
*  these inflammatory cytokines cause tryptophan [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1312.76s)]
*  to be diverted down a different pathway. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1316.8s)]
*  The pathway involves something called IDO, [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1320.32s)]
*  dolamine, which converts tryptophan into kinurine. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1322.5s)]
*  Kinurine actually acts as a neurotoxin by way [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1326.9199999999998s)]
*  of converting into something called quinolinic acid. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1330.32s)]
*  Okay, and quinolinic acid is pro-depressive. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1333.6399999999999s)]
*  So if that seems like a complicated biochemical pathway, [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1336.44s)]
*  what's basically happening here is that the tryptophan [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1338.8799999999999s)]
*  that normally would be made into serotonin [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1341.18s)]
*  under conditions of inflammation is being diverted [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1343.72s)]
*  into a neurotoxic pathway. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1346.0s)]
*  An ingestion of EPAs, [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1348.2s)]
*  because it limits these inflammatory cytokines, [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1350.0s)]
*  things like IL-6, C-reactive protein, et cetera, [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1353.1200000000001s)]
*  can cause more of the tryptophan that one ingests [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1357.44s)]
*  or has in their body to be diverted [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1361.88s)]
*  towards the serotonergic pathway. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1363.9s)]
*  Exercise, it turns out, also has a positive effect [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1366.0s)]
*  on the tryptophan to serotonin conversion pathway. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1370.36s)]
*  The activation of the muscles through rhythmic repeated use, [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1374.36s)]
*  in particular aerobic exercise, but also resistance training [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1377.78s)]
*  has been shown to do this to some extent, [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1380.8999999999999s)]
*  tends to sequester or shuttle the kinurine into the muscle [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1383.34s)]
*  so that it isn't converted into this neurotoxin [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1388.2199999999998s)]
*  that is pro-depression. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1391.1999999999998s)]
*  From the data that are published [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1393.62s)]
*  in quality peer review journals, [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1394.86s)]
*  it really appears that this inflammation pathway [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1396.2199999999998s)]
*  does function to increase depression through these pathways. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1398.1s)]
*  And so knowing that there are behavioral steps [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1401.6399999999999s)]
*  and supplementation-based steps, [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1403.78s)]
*  or if you prefer getting your EPAs from typical food, [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1405.3799999999999s)]
*  from nutritional approaches, [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1409.34s)]
*  I find that very reassuring that the mechanisms [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1411.98s)]
*  all converge on a common pathway, serotonin. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1414.98s)]
*  There's a common biochemical pathway [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1417.56s)]
*  that can explain why these things not just work, [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1419.4599999999998s)]
*  but why they should work. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1422.62s)]
*  They should work because they operate [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1424.3s)]
*  in the very same biochemical pathways [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1425.84s)]
*  that antidepressants that are prescribed to people do. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1428.32s)]
*  Now I want to talk about something that, at least for me, [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1432.4399999999998s)]
*  was quite surprising when I first learned about it [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1435.6399999999999s)]
*  for sake of treatment of mood disorders, [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1438.4199999999998s)]
*  and that's creatine. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1441.3999999999999s)]
*  Creatine has a number of very important functions [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1443.1599999999999s)]
*  throughout the body. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1445.9199999999998s)]
*  For those of you that are into resistance training, [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1447.24s)]
*  and actually for those of you [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1450.6399999999999s)]
*  that are into endurance training as well, [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1451.72s)]
*  phosphocreatine has achieved a lot of popularity [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1453.82s)]
*  in recent years because supplementation with creatine [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1457.06s)]
*  can draw more water into muscles [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1460.7s)]
*  and can increase power output from muscles. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1462.6799999999998s)]
*  However, there's also a so-called phosphocreatine system [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1465.1399999999999s)]
*  in the brain, and that phosphocreatine system [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1468.7s)]
*  has everything to do with the dialogue between neurons [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1471.98s)]
*  and these other cell types called glia. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1474.5s)]
*  But the phosphocreatine system in the forebrain in particular, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1477.6s)]
*  in the front of our brain, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1481.6599999999999s)]
*  has been shown to be involved in regulation of mood [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1482.5s)]
*  and some of the reward pathways as well as in depression. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1486.84s)]
*  The American Journal of Psychiatry in 2012 [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1491.3s)]
*  published a study which was a randomized [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1494.76s)]
*  double-blind placebo-controlled trial [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1497.3s)]
*  of oral creatine monohydrate, [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1498.78s)]
*  and what it found is that it could augment [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1500.86s)]
*  or enhance the response to a selective serotonin [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1503.46s)]
*  reuptake inhibitor, in particular in women [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1505.98s)]
*  with major depressive disorder. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1508.14s)]
*  So like EPA, creatine supplementation seems to either [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1510.02s)]
*  lower the required dose of SSRI [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1514.78s)]
*  that's required to treat depression [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1517.3799999999999s)]
*  or can improve the effectiveness of a given dose of SSRI. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1519.26s)]
*  However, there are other studies that have looked directly [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1525.58s)]
*  at creatine supplementation in the absence of SSRIs, [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1527.94s)]
*  and those are interesting as well. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1530.62s)]
*  So let's talk a little bit more [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1532.22s)]
*  about novel therapeutic compounds [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1533.34s)]
*  for the treatment of major depression. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1535.18s)]
*  One is ketamine, which is getting increasing interest [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1536.78s)]
*  in psychiatric clinics, [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1540.46s)]
*  in various experimental and clinical studies. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1542.1s)]
*  They create dissociative anesthetic states. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1544.48s)]
*  So dissociative states where people don't feel [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1547.66s)]
*  as closely meshed with their emotions and their perceptions. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1550.86s)]
*  Clinically, what's described in the trials for ketamine [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1555.46s)]
*  and things like it, that people who are depressed [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1559.54s)]
*  will take ketamine, will experience [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1562.54s)]
*  a kind of separateness from their grief [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1565.86s)]
*  and from their emotions. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1568.34s)]
*  And that possibly there's plasticity, [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1570.3999999999999s)]
*  there are actually shifts in the neural circuitry [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1573.02s)]
*  such that their emotions don't weigh on them so heavily. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1575.02s)]
*  It's not always about just getting people peppy [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1578.9799999999998s)]
*  and excited and happy. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1581.52s)]
*  There also seems to be a requirement for getting them [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1583.6799999999998s)]
*  distanced from their own grief. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1586.34s)]
*  And this brings us back to something that we talked about [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1588.62s)]
*  way back at the beginning of this episode, [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1590.9399999999998s)]
*  which was this particular feature [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1593.1s)]
*  of the anti-self confabulation. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1596.1799999999998s)]
*  That everything that happens is a reflection, [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1599.02s)]
*  that I should say for the depressed person, [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1601.56s)]
*  that everything that happens is a reflection [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1603.1799999999998s)]
*  of how life is bad and their experiences just point [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1605.02s)]
*  to the fact that nothing is going to get better. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1608.3999999999999s)]
*  This is the common language of depression. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1610.34s)]
*  If this is very depressing to hear me talk about, [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1612.34s)]
*  it is heavy. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1614.9199999999998s)]
*  And that's what it's like to hear these things. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1616.26s)]
*  It's even heavier, of course, [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1618.58s)]
*  for somebody to experience them. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1619.6999999999998s)]
*  And those beliefs, those patterns of guilt and grief [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1621.74s)]
*  and anhedonia and delusional anti-self confabulations, [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1627.04s)]
*  those are the things that eventually, [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1631.1s)]
*  if they get severe enough, [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1632.74s)]
*  start to convert into things like self-harm, mutilation, [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1634.38s)]
*  and in the most tragic of cases, of course, suicide. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1638.42s)]
*  And so I think we can look to these treatments [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1641.86s)]
*  such as ketamine and its use in the clinic [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1645.66s)]
*  as ways for people to get distanced [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1648.26s)]
*  from the negative affect that they feel [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1650.7s)]
*  isn't just inside them or overwhelms them, [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1653.3s)]
*  but that for the very severely depressed person, [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1656.22s)]
*  they feel is them. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1658.9s)]
*  Another category of treatments [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1660.82s)]
*  that's being actively explored now in laboratories [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1662.46s)]
*  and in the psychiatry realm are the psychedelics. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1665.74s)]
*  And that's a huge category of compounds. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1669.5s)]
*  However, one in particular, psilocybin is one [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1672.9s)]
*  that's being most intensely and actively pursued [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1675.94s)]
*  for its capacity to treat major depressive disorder. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1679.24s)]
*  But let's focus on psilocybin for its capacity [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1682.46s)]
*  to rewire neural circuits and alleviate depression. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1685.42s)]
*  There have been anecdotal data or evidence over the years [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1689.96s)]
*  that psilocybin has this capacity. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1694.26s)]
*  How does psilocybin work? [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1696.36s)]
*  Well, psilocybin engages or increases serotonin transmission, [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1697.76s)]
*  meaning it increases the amount of serotonin, [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1704.04s)]
*  mainly by acting at these 5H2A receptors. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1706.68s)]
*  But where in the brain does it happen [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1710.24s)]
*  and what are the major effects? [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1712.46s)]
*  First, let's talk about the major effects [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1713.68s)]
*  because I think that's what people are interested in. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1715.1200000000001s)]
*  The study that I'd like to highlight [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1717.3600000000001s)]
*  is a fairly recent one. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1718.88s)]
*  It was published in May of 2021 in Journal, excuse me, [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1721.18s)]
*  of the American Medical Association Psychiatry, [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1726.0800000000002s)]
*  so JAMA Psychiatry, and it's entitled [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1728.52s)]
*  Effects of Psilocybin-Assisted Therapy [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1730.96s)]
*  on Major Depressive Disorder, a Randomized Clinical Trial, [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1733.1200000000001s)]
*  basically what they did was they screened for patients [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1736.48s)]
*  to come into the clinic. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1740.14s)]
*  These were people that suffered [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1741.08s)]
*  from major depressive disorder [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1742.08s)]
*  and administered either one or two rounds of psilocybin. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1744.5s)]
*  Typically it was 20 milligrams per kilogram of body weight, [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1749.88s)]
*  so it depends on body weight. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1753.5s)]
*  What's really striking about this study [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1754.84s)]
*  is that there was a very significant improvement [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1757.28s)]
*  in mood and affect and relief from depressive symptoms [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1761.6s)]
*  in anywhere from 50 to 70% of the people [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1765.2s)]
*  that were subjects in the study [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1770.04s)]
*  who received the psilocybin treatment. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1772.0s)]
*  These are really enormous and significant effects. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1776.8s)]
*  What's really interesting is there are some common themes [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1779.8s)]
*  to psilocybin administration and experience [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1783.8s)]
*  that lead to relief from depressive symptoms, [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1787.64s)]
*  but they are subjectively, excuse me, [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1789.94s)]
*  subjectively very varied, meaning that whether or not [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1793.24s)]
*  people feel they had a good experience or a bad experience, [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1798.32s)]
*  whether or not people thought about their parents [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1801.04s)]
*  or thought about the color of the ceiling [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1803.1200000000001s)]
*  doesn't seem to have too much of an impact [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1805.94s)]
*  on whether or not they receive relief during these studies, [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1808.64s)]
*  in these clinical studies. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1813.3s)]
*  It seems like different people can have lots [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1815.76s)]
*  of different experiences and still receive benefit. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1817.64s)]
*  It's somehow rewiring associations between events, [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1821.16s)]
*  emotional events, past events, current events, [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1824.8000000000002s)]
*  and future events in ways that allow people [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1827.3600000000001s)]
*  to get some sort of relief or distance from these narratives, [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1830.22s)]
*  these depressive stories about their past and present [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1834.68s)]
*  and allow them to see new opportunity [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1837.88s)]
*  and optimism in the future. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1840.02s)]
*  One of the most common questions I get for this podcast [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1841.48s)]
*  is about different diets, different regimes, [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1844.24s)]
*  different nutritional plans, things like keto, [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1847.6200000000001s)]
*  ketogenic diet or vegan diets or intermittent fasting [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1850.36s)]
*  or the all meat diet, the so-called lion diet, et cetera. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1854.8799999999999s)]
*  There are actually really interesting data [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1858.6599999999999s)]
*  relating nutrition and diet to major depressive disorder. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1861.26s)]
*  There have been some explorations of whether or not [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1865.5s)]
*  a vegan diet can improve symptoms of depression. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1868.78s)]
*  Not a lot of data, not impressive data. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1872.1599999999999s)]
*  There have been very few controlled studies [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1874.52s)]
*  looking at the carnivore, all meat diet. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1876.76s)]
*  However, the ketogenic diet has been explored [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1880.0s)]
*  for its ability to relieve certain symptoms of depression, [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1883.6s)]
*  in particular to what's called maintain euthymia. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1889.56s)]
*  Euthymia is the kind of state of equilibrium [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1893.6s)]
*  between a manic episode and a depressive episode [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1896.28s)]
*  in a manic bipolar person. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1899.48s)]
*  Euthymia is that kind of place in the middle [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1900.76s)]
*  where people feel neither too high nor too low. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1903.88s)]
*  And there are some interesting studies [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1907.56s)]
*  looking at the ketogenic diet [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1909.8999999999999s)]
*  for maintaining euthymia in manic depressives, [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1911.56s)]
*  but also in people with major depressive disorder. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1914.44s)]
*  The ketogenic diet, by way of increasing ketone metabolism [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1917.24s)]
*  or shifting brain's metabolism over to ketones, [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1920.6799999999998s)]
*  tends to modulate GABA such that GABA is more active [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1924.34s)]
*  and adjusts the so-called GABA glutamate balance. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1930.36s)]
*  This is getting technical, [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1933.76s)]
*  but glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1934.76s)]
*  GABA is inhibitory neurotransmitter, [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1937.82s)]
*  and their balance is vital for neuroplasticity, [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1939.52s)]
*  for maintaining healthy levels of activity [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1942.24s)]
*  in the brain, et cetera. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1944.4s)]
*  And so there is decent evidence [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1946.56s)]
*  that people with major depressive disorders, [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1949.8799999999999s)]
*  in particular the people with major depressive disorders [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1953.1s)]
*  that are refractory, meaning they don't respond [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1956.92s)]
*  to classical antidepressants, [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1960.52s)]
*  can benefit, it seems, from the ketogenic diet. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1963.76s)]
*  It's really interesting that eating in a particular way, [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1968.56s)]
*  lowering carbohydrates to the point [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1971.1999999999998s)]
*  where you rely on ketogenic metabolism in the brain, [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1973.3999999999999s)]
*  increases GABA and can provide some relief [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1977.22s)]
*  for depressive symptoms, and that in particular [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1980.1599999999999s)]
*  that seems to have positive effects [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1983.28s)]
*  in people that are refractory or don't respond [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1985.08s)]
*  to classic antidepressants. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1987.4599999999998s)]
*  So today we've covered what at least feels to me [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1989.4399999999998s)]
*  like a tremendous amount of material. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1992.16s)]
*  This topic of depression is indeed an enormous topic [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1994.16s)]
*  to try and get our arms around. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1996.8600000000001s)]
*  We talked about the symptomology, [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1998.5s)]
*  we talked about some of the underlying [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=1999.8400000000001s)]
*  neurochemistry and biology, [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=2001.0800000000002s)]
*  and then we talked about approaches to deal with it [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=2002.72s)]
*  that are really grounded in the neurochemistry and biology. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=2005.0800000000002s)]
*  I just want to recap a few of those tools [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=2008.5600000000002s)]
*  and what those things are. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=2011.3600000000001s)]
*  So number one, don't overwhelm your pleasure centers, [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=2012.64s)]
*  either through activities or compounds. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=2016.8600000000001s)]
*  It might seem counterintuitive, [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=2018.92s)]
*  but you're setting yourself up for anhedonia and depression [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=2020.24s)]
*  if you do that. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=2023.38s)]
*  Second of all, talked about the norepinephrine system [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=2024.56s)]
*  and how the norepinephrine system is really deficient [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=2027.76s)]
*  in many forms of major depression and in depression. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=2030.56s)]
*  There is now more deliberate pursuit [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=2035.24s)]
*  of norepinephrine inducing activities that are healthy, [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=2038.04s)]
*  that aren't adrenaline seeking per se. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=2040.58s)]
*  Things like exercise that will increase [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=2043.76s)]
*  our levels of noradrenaline. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=2046.08s)]
*  I'd be remiss if I said that these activities [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=2047.52s)]
*  could completely eliminate depressive symptoms [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=2050.42s)]
*  in people with major depressive disorder. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=2053.72s)]
*  I don't think that's the case. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=2055.2599999999998s)]
*  And again, I want to acknowledge that people [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=2056.24s)]
*  with major depressive symptoms often don't have the energy, [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=2057.6s)]
*  the willingness or the capacity to engage [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=2061.56s)]
*  in some of these activities, [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=2064.56s)]
*  but things like cold showers, deliberate cold showers, [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=2065.52s)]
*  things like regular exercise, [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=2068.4s)]
*  they aren't just feel good activities. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=2070.68s)]
*  They actually engage the norepinephrine system [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=2073.52s)]
*  and keep that system tuned up [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=2076.1200000000003s)]
*  and allow us to increase our norepinephrine levels [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=2077.52s)]
*  at will on a regular basis. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=2079.6400000000003s)]
*  And their mood enhancing effects are real effects [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=2081.4s)]
*  at the level of neurochemistry. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=2084.0s)]
*  Then we talked about EPAs, these essential fatty acids. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=2086.2400000000002s)]
*  And it's clear that for most people, [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=2088.6000000000004s)]
*  getting above a thousand milligrams [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=2091.48s)]
*  and probably even closer to 2000 milligrams per day [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=2093.28s)]
*  of EPAs can be beneficial for mood, [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=2095.96s)]
*  especially in attempts to treat [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=2097.88s)]
*  or offset major depressive disorder. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=2100.2400000000002s)]
*  We also talked about exercise and how EPA and exercise [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=2102.6400000000003s)]
*  on a regular basis can offset these inflammatory pathways. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=2105.6s)]
*  And then we talked about the prescription compounds [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=2108.68s)]
*  and the compounds that are being used mainly [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=2111.3199999999997s)]
*  in the course of studies and of psychiatry and depression, [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=2113.2799999999997s)]
*  things like ketamine, psilocybin and related compounds. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=2116.24s)]
*  And then lastly, we talked about ketosis, [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=2118.8399999999997s)]
*  which may not be right for everybody, [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=2120.68s)]
*  but might be right for certain individuals out there [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=2122.12s)]
*  who are grappling with this. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=2125.24s)]
*  I want to thank you for embarking on this journey [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=2126.72s)]
*  of trying to understand what is depression, [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=2129.16s)]
*  how does it work and how to treat it. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=2131.36s)]
*  And thank you for your interest in science. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY&t=2133.68s)]
