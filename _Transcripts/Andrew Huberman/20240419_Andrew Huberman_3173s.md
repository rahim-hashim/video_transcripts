# LIVE EVENT Q&A: Dr. Andrew Huberman at the Sydney Opera House
**Andrew Huberman:** [April 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA89kjVY6Ik)
*  Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
*  where we discuss science
*  and science-based tools for everyday life.
*  I'm Andrew Huberman,
*  and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
*  at Stanford School of Medicine.
*  Recently, the Huberman Lab Podcast hosted a live event
*  at the Sydney Opera House in Australia.
*  The event was called the Brain-Body Contract
*  and featured a lecture,
*  followed by a question and answer session with the audience.
*  We wanted to make the question and answer session
*  available to everyone, regardless if you could attend.
*  So what follows is the question and answer session
*  from the Sydney Opera House in Australia.
*  I also would like to thank the sponsors for the event.
*  They are 8Sleep and AG1.
*  8Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling, heating,
*  and sleep tracking capacity.
*  And one of the key aspects to getting a great night's sleep
*  is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment.
*  And that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep,
*  your body temperature actually has to drop
*  by about one to three degrees.
*  And in order to wake up in the morning feeling refreshed,
*  your body temperature actually has to increase
*  by about one to three degrees.
*  8Sleep makes it extremely easy to control the temperature
*  of your sleeping environment at the beginning, middle,
*  and throughout the night and when you wake up in the morning.
*  I've been sleeping on an 8Sleep mattress cover
*  for nearly three years now,
*  and it has dramatically improved my sleep.
*  If you'd like to try 8Sleep,
*  you can go to 8Sleep.com slash Huberman
*  to save $150 off their pod three cover.
*  8Sleep currently ships to the USA, Canada, UK,
*  select countries in the EU and Australia.
*  Again, that's 8Sleep.com slash Huberman.
*  The other live event sponsor, AG1,
*  is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
*  that also contains adaptogens
*  and other critical micronutrients.
*  I've been taking AG1 daily since 2012,
*  so I'm delighted that they decided to sponsor the live event.
*  The reason I started taking it
*  and the reason I still take it every day,
*  once or twice a day,
*  is that it ensures that I meet all of my quotas
*  for vitamins and minerals,
*  and it ensures that I get enough prebiotic and probiotic
*  to support gut health.
*  Now, of course, I strive to consume healthy whole foods
*  for the majority of my nutritional intake every single day,
*  but there are a number of things in AG1,
*  including specific micronutrients
*  that are hard to get from whole foods
*  or at least in sufficient quantities.
*  So AG1 allows me to get the vitamins and minerals
*  that I need, probiotics, prebiotics, the adaptogens,
*  and critical micronutrients.
*  To try AG1, go to drinkag1.com slash Huberman,
*  and you'll get a year's supply of vitamin D3K2
*  and five free travel packs of AG1.
*  Again, that's drinkag1.com slash Huberman.
*  Thank you to the Sydney Opera House for hosting us
*  and for making this event possible.
*  ["Dreams of a New World"]
*  What are the latest findings
*  on the physiological mechanisms
*  behind stress's impact on the body
*  and brain, and what are some practical tools
*  or techniques for managing stress effectively?
*  Well, thank you for that question.
*  I'll deliberately not repeat what I said earlier
*  about physiological size, panoramic vision, et cetera,
*  and raising stress threshold,
*  because we covered that already.
*  But I think that one of the most interesting findings,
*  two most interesting findings in the field of stress
*  in the last five years or even three years,
*  I think the work from my colleague,
*  Ali Crum at Stanford, she's been a guest on the podcast,
*  she works on mindsets, is the following result.
*  Students, Stanford students, that is,
*  come into the laboratory, they view a,
*  I think it's a five minute movie
*  about how awful stress is for the mind and body,
*  all the things it does, like deplete your immune system,
*  make you miserable, deplete certain aspects
*  of the reproductive axis, and on and on,
*  and then a separate group comes in and watches a video,
*  also five minutes, also true,
*  about all the things that stress can do
*  to enhance performance, both cognitive or physical,
*  like excess or additional energy,
*  additional cognitive power, access to certain memory sets,
*  albeit narrow memory sets, et cetera,
*  and what you find is that the results
*  point directly to the fact that whatever you believe
*  about stress, provided the information you have is true,
*  is what happens.
*  So if I tell you that stress improves
*  your memory focus attention, one observes that.
*  If I tell you that stress depletes your immune system,
*  et cetera, one observes that.
*  So this is something that we don't quite yet understand
*  as neuroscientists, and the psychology of it
*  makes more sense, frankly, than the mechanisms,
*  but it's becoming very clear that what we believe
*  about a given phenomenon strongly impacts
*  how it shapes our response to that.
*  So I find that very interesting.
*  Now, of course, you can't delete information
*  about stress being bad for you,
*  so what does that mean if you want stress
*  to be enhancing, as it's called?
*  There's literally now called
*  the stress is enhancing mindset.
*  That the thing you can do is to learn more
*  about how stress can be enhancing.
*  We're not talking about lying,
*  we're not talking about placebo effect,
*  we're talking about real knowledge,
*  based in fact, that one can absorb,
*  and I find it amazing and wonderful
*  that the mere learning of something
*  can actually change how we respond
*  to something at a core physiological level.
*  The second, I think, very important set of findings
*  on stress relate to a structure
*  that I've talked about recently on the podcast,
*  and I talked about with the one and only David Goggins.
*  Most people presumably have heard,
*  he's on his way, he's running here right now
*  from Central America.
*  Yeah, that guy, I'll tell you,
*  that guy is every bit as intense as he comes across.
*  I met him for the first time in 2016
*  at a gathering in, it was in Silicon Valley,
*  we were just doing a little bit of work for this company.
*  At the end of the day, he leaves for a minute,
*  and he changes into his shorts and his shirt.
*  He's like, I'm going running, I gotta go to the airport.
*  I'm thinking, I'm gonna go running,
*  then I'm gonna go to the airport.
*  He was running to the airport.
*  Seriously, only like 14 miles from the airport,
*  which I realize 14 miles from Marathon are no big deal,
*  and he's got his bags.
*  And I'm thinking to myself, this guy is nuts,
*  and I love him.
*  I mean, he's really that guy.
*  It's actually very refreshing.
*  I think one reason we love the Rick Rubens
*  and the David Goggins is they truly are different,
*  but from one basic standpoint,
*  is they just don't give a shit.
*  They just do what they're gonna do,
*  and they trust that they're doing right for them
*  and for the people around them, and it's awesome.
*  It's really awesome.
*  And I think that it, again, brings about that word
*  that doesn't come about very often for me,
*  but it just kind of stuns you into like,
*  behold, David Goggins, Rick Rubin, the cuttlefish, whatever.
*  You know?
*  So, but I talked about this with David.
*  There's this structure in our brain,
*  and these are recent discoveries, not by my lab.
*  I wish I had discovered these,
*  but actually a colleague of mine at Stanford,
*  Joe Parvizzi, who's in the Department of Neurosurgery,
*  has made these beautiful discoveries
*  about the anterior mid-singulate cortex.
*  The anterior mid-singulate cortex
*  is a structure in the brain that has a lot of subdivisions,
*  but when Joe put a little stimulating electrode
*  into this area, because he had patients
*  that needed neurosurgery, and they probe around
*  asking questions, what do you feel, how do you feel,
*  what are you gonna do, and sometimes they hit an area.
*  I've seen these experiments, they're unbelievable.
*  Stimulated an area, and the person says,
*  I feel like I'm about to go into a rage.
*  You're like, okay, let's back off, let's move over here.
*  Anterior mid-singulate cortex, they stimulate,
*  and the patient, the person says,
*  I feel like I'm heading into a storm.
*  You go, oh, that doesn't sound good,
*  and they say, nope, but I'm ready, I'm leaning in.
*  A different patient, you stimulate their
*  anterior mid-singulate cortex, and the person says,
*  I feel like I'm gonna get up out of my chair
*  and do something really, really difficult.
*  Okay, so this is interesting.
*  Across multiple people, you're seeing the same general
*  forward center of mass response,
*  leaning into challenge, and challenge specifically,
*  and then there's now scores of studies
*  in just the last three to five years,
*  showing that, for instance, people who successfully
*  overcome a challenge of any kind,
*  fitness challenge, cognitive challenge,
*  anterior mid-singulate cortex expands,
*  or at least increases its baseline levels of activity.
*  You see people that fail to meet that challenge,
*  less anterior mid-singulate cortex activity,
*  so there's a bidirectionality of the response,
*  and on and on, and it seems that doing things
*  that are difficult, that we don't enjoy,
*  or that we have to push ourselves to do,
*  grow and enhance the activity within this
*  anterior mid-singulate cortex, and the beauty of it
*  is that it generalizes, that the anterior mid-singulate
*  cortex can be applied, or the growth of it
*  can be directed towards lots of different things,
*  which is, I think, a call for, of course,
*  seeking pleasure, seeking comfort, seeking relaxation,
*  seeking sleep every night, seeking sunlight
*  in the morning, et cetera, but also,
*  deliberately seeking out challenges,
*  that is, challenges for us.
*  The importance of doing hard things in a safe manner,
*  psychologically and physically safe manner, of course,
*  is truly beneficial toward our ability
*  to manage ourselves in what would otherwise
*  be called stress, so I think the work of Ali Krum
*  and the work on the anterior mid-singulate cortex
*  by Parvizzi and a bunch of other labs,
*  I think are the two areas where I feel like
*  things are happening really quickly,
*  we're making big strides as a field,
*  and we're moving away from kind of conjecture
*  about how to better ourselves in lots of different ways.
*  Can you talk about time perception?
*  Why is it that, in some instances, time moves very slowly,
*  while in others it seems to move very fast?
*  Thank you, tonight has been so fun.
*  Thank you.
*  I've had fun, too.
*  This is something I'm trying to do more of,
*  not necessarily live, that too, but someone recently
*  who I love and admire very much said to me,
*  we're gonna have so much fun, and I thought,
*  whoa, like, behold, no one's ever said that to me.
*  No one's ever said that to me.
*  All my years growing up, I mean,
*  I mean, with all due respect to my parents,
*  I can't remember anyone ever turning to me and saying,
*  we're gonna have so much fun.
*  So, I'm trying, that to me just kind of blew me away.
*  I'm thinking, yeah, like, you're allowed to have fun.
*  So, time perception is a topic that I am, you know,
*  as obsessed by as I am many other topics,
*  but one that is really near and dear to my heart,
*  because I've always been struck by this observation
*  that is certainly not uniquely mine,
*  that, you know, if you're sitting, waiting for an appointment
*  at the doctor's office, it feels like time goes by
*  really slowly, like really slowly.
*  Whereas if you have a really full day
*  with lots and lots of activities,
*  it seems like time went by really fast,
*  like, oh my God, I can't believe that
*  so much time has gone by.
*  Sorry, so much has happened, excuse me,
*  but not a lot of time has gone by,
*  which means that our frame rate on life is highly dynamic,
*  and in fact it is, and in fact it's set by,
*  you guessed it, our visual system,
*  at least for sighted folks,
*  for people who are low vision or no vision,
*  and by the way, I always reference that
*  because my laboratories worked on low vision,
*  no vision issues for a number of years.
*  It's through the auditory system.
*  But for sake of generalizing now and simplicity,
*  we'll talk about the visual system.
*  So it is a fact that when we focus on things up close,
*  think a watchmaker, think about looking into your phone,
*  our perception of time is more fine grained,
*  that is our frame rate is higher,
*  okay, so more frames per second
*  than when we view things at a distance.
*  You might think, well how could that possibly be?
*  How could that possibly be?
*  But it makes perfect sense, you know,
*  when we think about the time space coding in the brain,
*  we need to anchor ourselves to something,
*  the rising and setting of the sun,
*  of course, unless you're a flat earther,
*  we're going around the sun.
*  No, what's that?
*  No, we've got no flat earthers?
*  One flat earther in the audience, okay, cool.
*  I don't think that's what they were saying.
*  But we need to anchor ourselves in time,
*  and our visual system is the way
*  that we anchor ourselves in time.
*  We have facts about past, present, and future,
*  so we have knowledge.
*  But at an unconscious level,
*  we need to anchor our frame rate, set our frame rate.
*  And so this is why if you go down to Bondi
*  and you lie back and you look up at the clouds,
*  and the clouds are kind of moving in an unpredictable way,
*  whenever we're looking at a landscape
*  which has some lack of predictable features,
*  like waves or rustling of trees,
*  where you could predict that if the wind's blowing this way,
*  that the tree's gonna go this way and then back again,
*  but you're not really in a mode of trying to anticipate
*  just how far, in the same way that, for instance,
*  if you call an Uber or you're waiting on a text message,
*  if you're ever waiting on a text message,
*  you notice you'll find slice, okay, dot, dot, dot,
*  when's that thing coming, when's that thing,
*  you're find slicing time.
*  As your level of autonomic arousal goes up,
*  your frame rate goes up.
*  As your level of autonomic arousal goes down,
*  so you're sleepy, or if you're viewing things
*  that have kind of an unpredictable aspect to them,
*  then your frame rate expands, the passage of time changes,
*  or your perception of the passage of time changes.
*  This is why, one of the reasons why I love aquaria,
*  and one of my favorite things to do,
*  since I don't have a fish tank at home right now,
*  but that's gonna change soon, is I'll go on YouTube
*  and there's this beautiful live video
*  of this aquarium in Japan,
*  and I'll just zone out.
*  It's like the most relaxing thing ever,
*  and every once in a while, a whale,
*  they have a whale shark in an aquarium,
*  every once in a while a whale shark will go through
*  and go like whoa, and then it disappears,
*  and then the little fish and the kelp and things like that,
*  and it's immensely relaxing.
*  What it does is it slows your frame rate down,
*  and then I find that resets me after just five or six minutes
*  to go back to doing this high frame rate type stuff,
*  which is what we're doing when we're texting,
*  when we're typing, when we're, social media,
*  by the way, is tuned to a frame rate
*  that's really interesting, that keeps us engaged
*  just up into the point where then we wanna swipe
*  to the next thing.
*  The algorithms are designed,
*  and by the way, I have a somewhat benevolent,
*  semi-benevolent view of social media,
*  I think it'd be used for good,
*  I think it'd be used for not good,
*  I think limiting one's time on there is good,
*  but there's some good content on there for sure.
*  A lot of my life is spent on there, indeed.
*  So frame rate is set by where you're looking.
*  The further out you're looking,
*  the larger, the longer time bins you're capturing,
*  bigger time bins, less resolution.
*  Closer in, and the more you're trying to predict
*  the next outcome, fine-grain analysis,
*  predicting what we call DPOs, duration, path, and outcome,
*  what's gonna happen for how long,
*  and what's gonna happen is something
*  that you're thinking about and wondering about,
*  then frame rate goes up.
*  And there's actually a wonderful movie,
*  a Hitchcock movie, the name escapes me at the moment,
*  in which Hitchcock understood this,
*  and it's a movie that's only about 90 minutes long,
*  but in the background, the sun rises and sets,
*  and the way that people move through the scenes
*  of this movie gives you the feeling
*  by the end of this 90-minute movie
*  that a full 24 hours passed.
*  It's really interesting.
*  You feel it in your body as if it was a much longer movie,
*  even though if you look at your watch, that happens,
*  and now the cannabis smokers again are thinking,
*  yeah, where you sit there and you're like,
*  whoa, that was a really long time you looked at it.
*  It's like three minutes went by,
*  and you're like, whoa, wow.
*  Psychedelics will do this as well.
*  They certainly do, they distort our time perception,
*  mainly through the deployment of large amounts
*  of the neuromodulator serotonin,
*  which is intimately involved
*  in our clock perception mechanisms.
*  There are a bunch of other things
*  that can set intrinsic rhythmicity
*  of our auditory system that also adjust our frame rate.
*  I think one of the reasons why 40 hertz tones
*  can be valuable for doing cognitive work
*  is that they tend to entrain certain circuits
*  within the brain for doing the kinds of work
*  that most people call work,
*  kind of where you have to type things out,
*  think logically, kind of if-then kind of analysis.
*  Very different than, say, writing new sheet music
*  or coming up with poetry where, you know,
*  here again we can think back to the Rick Rubin thing
*  or being stationary, right?
*  You know, like the wall are sitting within a movement
*  in the brain going forward.
*  There's something about adjusting frame rate
*  for capturing new ideas versus implementing ideas.
*  Implementation of ideas tends to be carried out
*  on higher frame rate type time perception,
*  and now you can understand why our visual perception
*  set it about the distance of a laptop or phone
*  would be good for that, or a conversation.
*  You know, remember that whole thing
*  of like looking at somebody's face
*  and having a conversation,
*  as opposed to looking off into the distance,
*  walking and allowing one's gaze to go panoramic.
*  So hopefully now you're starting to sense some themes.
*  So that's all I'll say about time perception now,
*  but of course humans have throughout history
*  and still now, frankly, also embarked on a lot
*  of pharmacology, if we're honest,
*  in order to try and adjust frame rate
*  for sake of productivity,
*  but caffeine will adjust frame rate
*  in the predictable direction,
*  but also things like alcohol and various drugs,
*  like cannabis in order to adjust frame rate.
*  I'm certainly not suggesting you do those things.
*  I'm not a cop, you do what you want,
*  just know what you're doing.
*  Can you please talk about the jet lag protocol
*  you followed when arriving in Sydney?
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Well, this one was a little bit easier for me
*  because obviously it's not that far off,
*  it's just you're a full day ahead
*  from where I live back home in California,
*  but nonetheless, I suffer tremendously from jet lag,
*  and once actually in 2017, I went to Abu Dhabi,
*  it's a 12 hour flip from where I was living
*  at that time in the Bay Area, and I was a wreck.
*  I could barely make it to the meeting, I was crying,
*  I was like, it really messes me up.
*  I slept great the first night
*  and then just didn't sleep for two days, I was a mess.
*  So jet lag is something that I really had to work hard on,
*  and there are a couple things worth noting,
*  and we've done a whole episode about this,
*  but I'll kind of hit a few key bullet points,
*  and maybe it's relevant to you
*  even if you're not traveling at any point soon,
*  because many people are jet lagged without traveling
*  because of the way that they stay up late.
*  In fact, most everybody in the world now
*  qualifies as a shift worker, did you know that?
*  And here, no disrespect, only reverence and gratitude
*  to the actual shift workers that stay up all night
*  doing emergency work and hospital work
*  and caring for children and things like that
*  throughout the night, so I'm not trying
*  to take anything away from them,
*  but we are all shifted enough by virtue
*  of artificial lighting and electronic devices
*  that we are effectively shifted and shift working
*  because we're staying up, engaging our cognitive systems
*  in ways that frankly we didn't evolve to,
*  which I'm not saying is bad, but it's just the reality.
*  Okay, what to do for jet lag?
*  The key thing is this, and actually this is very valuable
*  in general for sake of sleep, so this is something
*  I haven't talked enough about on the podcast.
*  Ask yourself what time you normally wake up
*  without an alarm.
*  I realize there's some variance day to day,
*  but for me it would be about, let's say 6 a.m.
*  So let's say for you it's seven.
*  Pick your typical wake up time.
*  If you subtract from that number, so for me 4 a.m.,
*  that almost with certainty is what's called
*  your temperature minimum.
*  Your temperature minimum, we could measure it,
*  you could put a thermometer in your mouth
*  or if you come to the laboratory,
*  unfortunately they have to do it rectally.
*  4 a.m. would be my temperature minimum.
*  Maybe for you if you wake up at seven,
*  typically or around seven, it's gonna be 5 a.m.
*  So we're not actually measuring your temperature
*  in this kind of g'donk in this thought experiment.
*  What we're doing is we're trying to find a time.
*  So here's what's interesting.
*  If you expose your eyes, not your skin, but your eyes,
*  to bright light in the two hours or so,
*  maybe three hours prior to that temperature minimum time,
*  so if you wake up at 7 a.m., 5 a.m. is your temperature
*  minimum, so in the two hours, maybe three hours prior to that,
*  you're going to shift your wake up time and your to bed time,
*  what's called a phase delay, a shift in your circadian
*  rhythm by about an hour.
*  Interesting.
*  Given that if you view bright light in the two to three hours
*  after your temperature minimum, you advance your clock,
*  meaning you pull back your clock to want to wake up
*  a bit earlier and go to sleep a little bit earlier
*  by about an hour for every time you do that.
*  You think, well, okay, I wake up in the morning at seven,
*  let's say I'm using you as an example or me at six,
*  and I usually try and get some sunlight in my eyes,
*  especially on overcast days, et cetera, et cetera,
*  you've heard me blab about this many times before
*  on the podcast and elsewhere,
*  so how come I'm not going to bed earlier and earlier
*  every night and waking up earlier and earlier every morning?
*  And indeed, you would, you would keep phase advancing
*  your clock if you did that, except that in the afternoon,
*  if you got sunlight in your eyes, as presumably you did
*  today, it was a beautiful sunny day on your way here,
*  you phase delayed your clock a little bit,
*  and as a consequence, you wake up and go to sleep
*  at more or less the same time every day.
*  It's an amazing mechanism, and guess what?
*  Viewing sunlight in the middle of the day
*  does not do the same thing, it doesn't shift
*  your circadian clock, they don't tell you that in school,
*  but they should, they're telling you all the other stuff.
*  The reason it doesn't do it is that middle of the day period
*  is what's called the circadian dead zone,
*  sounds very dramatic, very ominous.
*  Getting sunlight in your eyes during the middle of the day
*  is great for mood, it's evident that it's also important
*  if it gets on your skin and healthy, not burning amounts,
*  levels that would induce burn, then it can enhance
*  testosterone, estrogen levels, et cetera,
*  in healthy ways, healthy ratios.
*  Nonetheless, that morning sunlight viewing
*  after your temperature minimum advances your clock,
*  makes you want to get up earlier, go to bed earlier,
*  viewed before delays your clock,
*  makes you want to get up later, go to bed later.
*  So, this is very useful if you ever want to shift your clock
*  at home before you travel to get onto a new schedule
*  for work or school, or if you're traveling.
*  What it means is that when you arrive in a new location,
*  like I did in Melbourne the other day,
*  believe me, I practiced that for like at least an hour,
*  and with two Aussies, and they kept telling me
*  I was doing it wrong until finally they're like,
*  no, I'm just joking with you, you got it right
*  like the fourth time.
*  You guys have a wicked sense of humor down here.
*  It's like I'm tougher than I look.
*  The key thing is that if you land,
*  you have to ask, let's say at 8 a.m. local,
*  or noon local time, the key is to ask yourself,
*  hmm, what does my body think?
*  What is my temperature minimum from back home?
*  So for instance, if you land at 5 p.m.,
*  but it corresponds to the time before your temperature
*  minimum, and you go outside, and you're like,
*  whoa, beautiful setting sun.
*  I'm supposed to get sunlight in my eyes.
*  Well guess what, you might delay your clock
*  if you want to go to bed earlier,
*  that's probably not a good idea.
*  Whereas if you want to advance your clock,
*  you would view sunlight at a time that is corresponding
*  to the two hours after your temperature minimum.
*  I realize it's a little bit tricky,
*  but that's all you have to ask yourself
*  for the first three days, first three days
*  that you travel to some location,
*  because then you can shift very fast.
*  So what that requires is sometimes saying,
*  oh, I don't want to shift myself,
*  so I'm actually going to wear sunglasses and a brimmed hat
*  to avoid shifting, because I'd like to be
*  on the local schedule.
*  Or in some cases, you can go, I really want to wake up here,
*  and I'm in the perfect opportunity to wake up,
*  because it's the middle of the afternoon in Sydney,
*  and back home, I would have just hit my temperature minimum,
*  and so I'm going to get sunlight in my eyes.
*  Well, that's going to wake me up,
*  and it's going to actually make me want to go to bed
*  a little bit earlier, so I can go to bed at local time,
*  so I'm not going to be up until 3 a.m.
*  So you might have to work this out a little bit on paper,
*  but this is the way that military,
*  and this is the way that shift workers
*  who are educated in the mechanisms of this stuff,
*  that's the way they do it.
*  It also helps to eat on the local schedule,
*  because food is another what we call zeitgeber,
*  another one of the timekeepers for the circadian clock,
*  so if you force yourself to eat on the local schedule,
*  that can help you shift.
*  Activity can help you shift,
*  and social rhythms can help you shift as well.
*  But that temperature minimum and the role of light
*  before or after the temperature minimum,
*  either delaying or advancing your clock,
*  that's the heavy hammer in this whole process.
*  So I did that, and these days,
*  I do a lot of red light time in the evening
*  when I want to go to sleep,
*  and I don't mean red light panels,
*  like the expensive stuff that has a whole other set of uses.
*  What I'm talking about is just getting a red light,
*  like a party light.
*  We turn off the lights and put in a red light,
*  and that is known to reduce cortisol levels
*  as opposed to other kinds of lighting.
*  So it only takes about half hour
*  before you go to sleep or so.
*  You want to just mellow out.
*  You just switch over to red light.
*  It's actually very pleasant, right?
*  As long as you can go about the activities
*  you want to do safely,
*  you just put a red light up.
*  And by the way, Rick's house is like all red lights at night.
*  No artificial lighting past sundown.
*  Guys, like a plant.
*  Can you elaborate on the science
*  between psychedelic psilocybin and neuroplasticity?
*  Yes.
*  This is a topic that just a few years ago
*  I was like too frightened to talk about.
*  I was afraid to lose my job, frankly.
*  These are still scheduled drugs in the United States,
*  although they are being explored for therapeutic reasons,
*  mainly for the treatment of severe depression.
*  But among other things, smoking cessation, eating disorders,
*  by the way anorexia nervosa still is the highest morbidity
*  of any psychiatric challenge.
*  It's just really tragic.
*  So there's a real need for treatments that work.
*  And psychedelics like psilocybin, LSD to some extent,
*  MDMA, which technically is not a psychedelic,
*  it's an empathogen,
*  but we could talk about that, also called ecstasy.
*  So these sorts of compounds have been explored
*  quite extensively in the last few years.
*  I've completely revamped my stance on them
*  for a couple of reasons.
*  I'll just come clean.
*  As a kid, too young, I explored these things.
*  I do not recommend that.
*  I had some pretty bad experiences on LSD as a young teenager.
*  And I don't recommend it.
*  I think the brain is highly plastic that time.
*  In fact, being an adolescent, a kid or a teen
*  is a psychedelic experience.
*  You do not need psychedelics and I don't recommend them
*  unless some very qualified clinician
*  can convince you otherwise.
*  There I would also seek a second opinion.
*  But they clearly have their role.
*  And I think a couple of things have changed my stance.
*  First of all, there are a lot of federally funded studies
*  taking place at Stanford and elsewhere on these compounds.
*  Second, for whatever reason,
*  and I don't quite understand the sociology of it,
*  but for whatever reason, psychedelics are no longer
*  associated with the kind of counterculture
*  the way they used to be.
*  And are in fact heavily associated
*  with some of the veterans groups
*  that are using these for PTSD with groups in the states,
*  groups like Veterans Solutions,
*  which are doing amazing work with different psychedelics
*  including Ibogaine, Iboga,
*  which is a 22 hour long psychedelic journey.
*  I've never done it, truly, where you close your eyes
*  and you get essentially real life like recollection
*  of your experiences, but you have agency
*  inside these experiences.
*  There's some cardiac issues with Ibogaine
*  that require constant monitoring of the heart,
*  but they've got some really impressive outcomes.
*  This is all worked by my colleague
*  Nolan Williams at Stanford.
*  So things like psilocybin,
*  we view a little bit differently nowadays.
*  What is psilocybin?
*  Psilocybin, if you look at it chemically,
*  looks a lot like serotonin.
*  A lot like serotonin.
*  And it tickles, that is it binds nearly selectively
*  to a specific serotonin receptor,
*  and it seems to create more
*  what we call resting state lateral connectivity,
*  which means more brain areas connected to other brain areas,
*  or at least talking to those brain areas,
*  after the psilocybin journey, as it's called,
*  as opposed to before.
*  Now, these journeys, and I have done them as an adult,
*  I did this as part of a clinical trial.
*  I participated in a psilocybin trial,
*  and I participated in MDMA trial.
*  They can be terrifying while they're happening,
*  but often there's great insight from those experiences,
*  provided the right support is provided,
*  and they always say set and setting.
*  So I'm not providing all these caveats about safety
*  for no reason, or to protect me,
*  I'm saying to protect you.
*  I mean, it can be, and it was for me, absolutely terrifying.
*  And then you do it again as part of these trials.
*  The second time I'm like,
*  okay, this time I'm just gonna be good at going,
*  boom, terrifying.
*  It was horrible.
*  But I learned a lot.
*  And there does seem to be an antidepressant effect.
*  I wasn't clinically diagnosed with depression,
*  but prior to that, or after, thank goodness.
*  But I think what we're seeing with these compounds,
*  and from my own experience, if I may,
*  is that they allow us to see relationships
*  between events of past and present,
*  and hopefully anticipate certain actions
*  and changes into the future,
*  while experiencing the fullness of the emotionality
*  of those experiences in real time.
*  So as somebody who's done an immense amount of therapy,
*  I can tell you that I find great value in talk therapy,
*  I do, especially of the, I think what's called
*  insight-oriented psychoanalysis,
*  or psychotherapy doesn't have to be classic psychoanalysis.
*  Not just support, you need that.
*  Not just rapport, you need that.
*  But insight as well is the goal, those three things.
*  But one of the issues is,
*  unless you get on the phone with your therapist,
*  or you talk to them in person,
*  in a moment where something is really acute,
*  like it's really getting you right at that moment,
*  sad or happy, or whatever it may be,
*  it's hard to experience the fullness of that issue
*  in that moment, while also parsing it cognitively.
*  And it does seem that the psychedelics,
*  and to some extent MDMA,
*  allow people to get into the full amplitude,
*  maybe even enhanced amplitude,
*  emotionality of an experience,
*  and at the same time, allow people to reflect,
*  and with the help of a so-called guide or the therapist,
*  take notes in a way that leads
*  to specific actionable outcomes.
*  And I think that's the real value.
*  You can get real-time experience with insight,
*  and of course you need support as well.
*  And of course set and setting and safety are absolutely key.
*  So psilocybin seems to do that in one manner.
*  MDMA does it in a different way.
*  MDMA, by the way, we know dramatically increases
*  serotonin and dopamine,
*  but it seems to be the serotonergic effect
*  that is responsible for most of its therapeutic effect.
*  By the way, MDMA is methylene-dioxymethamphetamine,
*  which isn't necessarily saying that it's bad.
*  What's actually interesting is that MDMA,
*  ecstasy, provided that it's pure
*  and in the appropriate dosage range,
*  does not seem to be neurotoxic
*  as it once was thought to be.
*  The paper claiming that was retracted,
*  they accidentally were giving the subjects in that study
*  methamphetamine, not MDMA.
*  Right, yes, right.
*  And they retracted the paper,
*  but nobody talks about that paper.
*  But do you know, it's kind of interesting,
*  do you know where most of the data
*  on the lack of toxicity of MDMA comes from?
*  There's a beautiful set of studies
*  that were carried out on subjects
*  who were exclusively from the Church of Latter-day Saints,
*  sometimes referred to as Mormons, right?
*  Mormons are an excellent test population
*  for a study like that because they don't do other drugs.
*  But MDMA is not on the no-fly list.
*  So apparently, according to these papers,
*  and by the way, I have a lot of friends who are LDS
*  and they're wonderful people.
*  According to these papers, which I believe,
*  because they're published and peer-reviewed
*  and they still are in the literature,
*  you can find subjects in that community,
*  not all LDS folks are taking ecstasy, I don't think,
*  but presumably no, but people who have taken anywhere
*  from one to two to 50 to over 100 doses of MDMA
*  in a short period of time.
*  And aside from a mild deficit in attention
*  in the people who have taken the large doses
*  or frequent doses, that is, there do not seem to be
*  many cognitive deficits that are detectable
*  and certainly no apparent neurotoxicity,
*  which is not to say go do MDMA as much as you like.
*  I think there is the potential for neurotoxicity
*  if it's taken too often and things of that sort.
*  So a lot to still figure out.
*  But MDMA seems to have a slightly different trajectory
*  than psilocybin, it tends to be less scary,
*  although it is very sympathetic arousing, that is,
*  so people can get afraid or if they have
*  elevated heart rate, et cetera.
*  But the empathogenic component is really interesting
*  because ultimately with PTSD, it's really about
*  developing empathy for one's self.
*  It's really about developing empathy for one's self
*  and resolving one of the core issues of trauma,
*  which is often not discussed, which is that
*  at an unconscious level, at an unconscious level,
*  trauma seems to be a confusion to the nervous system
*  about who's responsible, so that even if somebody
*  knows and understands, hey, that was them,
*  they're the perpetrator, I'm the victim,
*  somehow the nervous system gets confused
*  about responsibility in a way that leads to triggering
*  of some of the negative feelings around that event
*  or events, as the case may be, and MDMA seems to be able
*  to intervene in that confusion and short circuit
*  that confusion through this self empathy.
*  Self empathy is something that I think deserves
*  more exploration in the years to come.
*  So lots happening there in the United States,
*  MDMA is now being registered with the FDA
*  perhaps for legalization right now, it is still illegal.
*  So if you take any of what I said tonight and go buy MDMA,
*  I'm not at fault, okay.
*  Getting in the sauna about two hours before going to sleep
*  really improves my quality of sleep, what's going on here?
*  Ah, love this, this one can be pretty simple,
*  the relationship between temperature and sleep
*  is a well established one, to fall asleep,
*  you need to cool down by one to three degrees,
*  you've probably heard me say that before, to wake up,
*  you need to heat up by about one to three degrees,
*  and when you get into a sauna or you take a hot bath
*  or even to a lesser degree, you wash your face
*  with warm water in the evening, hands with warm water
*  because of the way that the body thermoregulates,
*  you actually end up cooling yourself off,
*  you think, no, I got in the sauna,
*  actually I've been going to the sauna at this place here,
*  Recovery, they have a wonderful sauna, cold plunge,
*  and then they have this bed where you float on the thing,
*  have you tried this thing?
*  This thing is so cool, it's like a water bed,
*  but it like floats you, they're amazing, amazing.
*  By the way, they don't pay me to say that,
*  I'm just grateful that they let me like sit in this bed,
*  I've been sleeping in there as much as possible,
*  but they shut down at night eventually,
*  and then I gotta go home.
*  So the sauna's a great tool before sleep
*  or a warm shower or a hot bath or a warm bath
*  for the following reason,
*  the brain area that controls thermoregulation
*  is the medial preoptic area,
*  which operates like a thermostat,
*  so if you warm the external portion of the body,
*  the brain has to then what,
*  cool down your core body temperature.
*  It doesn't happen right away,
*  but it happens as you get out of the sauna
*  and maybe you take a warmish shower or a cool shower.
*  So what ends up happening is that you warmed up,
*  which allows you to cool down internally
*  and then you're able to fall asleep
*  and stay more deeply asleep.
*  That's probably what's improving your sleep.
*  In fact, a kind of mantra that I learned
*  from the great Matt Walker
*  who wrote the great book, Why We Sleep,
*  and by the way, we have a sleep series
*  with the mighty Matt Walker coming out later this year.
*  We recorded six episodes,
*  every aspect of sleep you can imagine.
*  He says, and I hope I'm getting this right,
*  he says, you need to warm up to cool down to go to sleep,
*  or to fall, warm up to cool down to fall asleep,
*  stay cool to stay asleep, warm up to wake up.
*  There you go.
*  That's a straight bite out of Matt Walker's mouth,
*  so he deserves that citation, not me.
*  So that's what's happening when you get in the sauna.
*  Now when you get into the cold plunge,
*  you're cold, but guess what?
*  Same thing, the surface of your body is cooler,
*  those thermoreceptors transmit information
*  to the medial preoptic area of your body
*  and your core body temperature eventually goes up,
*  provided you don't stay in there,
*  get hypothermic, of course.
*  People are always asking me,
*  I have a good friend who just so happens to be straight edged,
*  he's like never even has a sip of caffeine.
*  I don't know, it's a good thing because he's extreme
*  and he got a cold plunge and he went in for a minute
*  and then the next day he's like I did three minutes
*  and then pretty soon he's like hey, I got sick
*  and I was like what'd you do?
*  And he's like I got naked in the cold plunge for 45 minutes.
*  I was like well listen, first of all,
*  thank goodness you don't do drugs
*  and second of all, easy does it, easy does it.
*  The cold is a very powerful stimulus as is heat,
*  so minimal effective dose,
*  have some fun with it but don't go wild.
*  I still don't know why you got in there naked,
*  but who knows?
*  If we expose ourselves to the same stress
*  over and over again,
*  do we release the same amount of adrenaline
*  and it's positive negative impact
*  and just becomes less receptive,
*  do we release less adrenaline and hence it's less harmful?
*  It's a great question, depends on the context.
*  Typically you'd release less and less adrenaline
*  and actually this relates to a really important fact
*  about the ever famous structure of the amygdala
*  which means almond.
*  I don't know why I told you that.
*  The, happens to be shaped like an almond.
*  The amygdala, people associate with threat detection
*  and danger but it's actually a novelty detector essentially
*  and it's involved with a bunch of other brain circuits
*  that anytime we experience something novel,
*  we have an elevated level of autonomic arousal.
*  Like earlier tonight before the show,
*  there was a kind of a repeating,
*  and the first time it happened I'm like,
*  fire alarm, like what's going on?
*  By the time it happened five times,
*  I was kind of like, eh.
*  So that's sort of, I'd be willing to bet both amygdalas
*  that had recorded from my amygdalas,
*  it's got one on each side of the brain,
*  you would find that the first time
*  the big increase in activity,
*  lesser, second, third, fourth, fifth,
*  and you attenuate, you habituate.
*  So if the stressor is one in which you don't care,
*  it doesn't have much relevance to you, like that alarm,
*  probably less and less adrenaline, I'd be willing to bet.
*  However, if with each subsequent exposure,
*  like somebody you really can't stand or something like that,
*  it's decreasing your life satisfaction
*  and increasing your level of cognitive
*  or psychological stress,
*  then it would go in the opposite direction.
*  I think that's fair to say.
*  Hey, hey Andrew.
*  Oh yeah, I like that.
*  Hey, that's cool.
*  Yeah, the other day it was really interesting,
*  every once in a while someone would walk up and be like,
*  hey, listen to the podcast, it was always nice,
*  it's always nice to meet people,
*  and this kid walks up to me, this was in Melbourne,
*  in the gym, like this has never happened to me before,
*  it was really cool, he just walks up, he goes,
*  hey Andrew, I'm like cool, like he just said, that's it,
*  and he just walked away, I was like, all right,
*  like, I was like cool, and I was like,
*  that kid is so mellow, it was really cool,
*  like I was like, we would have been friends,
*  actually we were friends with all the wild ones,
*  but it was a really interesting phenotype.
*  Again, human phenotypes fascinate me,
*  so if we run into each other on the street
*  and I ask your name and we talk, I'm genuinely interested,
*  I'm not studying you, I'm not taking notes or data,
*  but people are so different, but hey Andrew,
*  okay, so maybe it's him.
*  Hey Andrew, hey, Adi.
*  I've found that I'm able to focus far better
*  when I bounce my legs up and down
*  while sitting on the balls of my feet, what's going on here?
*  You got a lot of energy, that's what's going on.
*  No, I think, you know, there isn't a ton of science on this,
*  but it's very clear, as I mentioned earlier,
*  that people have different spontaneous movement rates
*  and some people, you know,
*  some people are a little bit more jittery.
*  If you look, if you go into a classroom, young children,
*  see them sitting around, boys and girls,
*  let's say somewhere between four and six,
*  oftentimes you'll notice that some of the kids
*  can sit extremely still
*  and then some of the kids are like really like.
*  And there is a chromosomal difference there.
*  It's known that boys have a slower development
*  of the so-called top-down inhibition from the forebrain.
*  The prefrontal cortex, which frankly we hear about
*  over and over again, many podcasts,
*  a lot of description of prefrontal cortex,
*  its main job, the best description,
*  I've ever heard of it anyway,
*  is my friend who's a neurosurgeon at Neuralink
*  who came up through my lab, Matt McDougall,
*  he's been on the podcast,
*  he says the job of the prefrontal cortex
*  is to send connections to the rest of the brain
*  and say shh, basically, to the appropriate circuit.
*  So that's why people with damage to the prefrontal cortex
*  for any reason or degeneration of the prefrontal cortex
*  find themselves doing things,
*  or we find them doing things
*  that are a little bit context inappropriate.
*  And in some cases, dramatically inappropriate,
*  but in most cases, just kind of context inappropriate.
*  They don't suppress behavior very well.
*  So it may be that a certain level of autonomic arousal
*  brings us into that optimal,
*  some people call it a flow state.
*  A flow state is a little bit of a nebulous thing.
*  I mean, I have great respect for Steven Kotler
*  and those that have talked about and written about flow,
*  but what I really can just say about flow
*  as it relates to neuroscience
*  is that backwards it spells wolf.
*  We don't really know that much more
*  about the neural basis of a flow state.
*  But for each of us, we have these kind of tunnels
*  that we like to be in
*  where we find that our level of focus and action
*  is just right.
*  And so I don't think I'm going too far out on a limb here.
*  How do you, by saying that if you find that you focus best
*  when you can dispel a little bit of that energy
*  by moving your body,
*  that you're able to do your best work,
*  that makes sense to me.
*  I don't do them so much anymore,
*  but for years I would do surgeries,
*  lots and lots of surgeries down the microscope,
*  dissecting retinas, dissecting retinas.
*  Like if you got an eyeball, I can dissect it.
*  I'm good at it.
*  I can do them in my sleep.
*  And I would find that if I had a little bit too much energy,
*  that the forceps would jiggle a little bit.
*  And what's in the caffeine thing?
*  And a friend of mine who's a world-class neurosurgeon,
*  Eddie Chang is chair of neurosurgery at UCSF.
*  He's been on the podcast.
*  He said, ah, there's a solution to that
*  that we learn in neurosurgery.
*  They're like the astronauts of medicine.
*  He said, you know, you tap your foot.
*  That's kind of cool.
*  Why would that work?
*  He said, well, basically,
*  you've got some sort of anticipatory activity
*  in an area of the brain called the basal ganglia,
*  which is involved in these go, no-go type actions,
*  like all of our actions are yes-go and no-go,
*  don't do something else.
*  So flexor, extensor, those all kinds of stuff.
*  Very complicated, but seamless for most people.
*  And when you have a bit too much anticipatory activity,
*  you're getting ready to go like a sprinter out the blocks.
*  And you're doing something that's very important,
*  like a brain surgery, in his case,
*  or a microsurgery, in my case, for research purposes,
*  that if your activation state is too high,
*  that you can dispel some of that energy
*  by just simply tapping your foot
*  or doing some sort of rhythmic activity
*  with another part of your body
*  appropriate to that context, of course.
*  Okay.
*  Last question, I'm gonna roll.
*  Hey, Andrew.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, oh, they skipped that one.
*  I guess that's the new thing.
*  I'll never forget when I got my lab for the first time.
*  I came up in an era when it was still pretty formal.
*  Neuroscience, you're like, you'd say,
*  hey, professor, so and so,
*  and then they say, you can call me Barbara,
*  and I'm like, hey, Barbara.
*  But before that, no one, you know,
*  I needed to hey, and I'll never forget that in my lab,
*  my first graduate student, who's now a professor,
*  he's a very, very talented scientist
*  at the University of Utah.
*  And I got a text from him, and he just said,
*  she called me Andy.
*  She said, hey, Andy, when are you gonna buy us
*  an espresso maker?
*  It was like the second day, and I was like, whoa.
*  Times have changed.
*  So I think it's good.
*  I think the lack of formality is actually good.
*  At first, I was like, wait a second,
*  I waited my whole life to become a professor,
*  and now it's hey, Andy?
*  But I think, you know, with the years,
*  I've realized that it's actually kind of nice.
*  I'm 17 years old.
*  Congratulations.
*  I mean, I wish I was, you didn't wanna know me when I,
*  I was a nice kid, but I was just,
*  I had a lot of confusion.
*  I'm 17 years old, so you're in a psychedelic experience
*  of youth.
*  What is your biggest advice on finding your passion?
*  Oh, well, goodness gracious.
*  I think you know, if I'm honest,
*  I think we talked about it a little bit earlier.
*  I think your passion is rooted in a feeling state
*  that you've already accessed, hopefully many times,
*  but at least one time earlier in your life,
*  when for whatever reason or circumstances,
*  you weren't thinking about what your parents wanted you
*  to do, what was cool or not cool in school.
*  You were in a pure feeling state of yum.
*  Yum.
*  That's really cool.
*  Behold.
*  And so I can't answer the question for you,
*  but I'll tell you, yes, continue to forage.
*  I do believe that learning is among the most wonderful
*  things that we can do for ourselves,
*  but that if you spend some time in your memory banks,
*  that you'll be able to remember a feeling,
*  and maybe the feeling was about a board game you played
*  or something you observed,
*  or maybe it just came about through some other activity
*  and the feeling is unrelated to the activity.
*  That's where it gets a little tricky,
*  and we're answering this question for a 17-year-old,
*  but it's true for all of us.
*  This is where it gets a little tricky,
*  is that sometimes we think it's the activity,
*  but it's not the activity.
*  I mean, Lord knows, I stay out of the Aquarius stores
*  these days.
*  Because if I go near one, it's all over.
*  It's the delight in something that is very personal,
*  in fact, I think is very unique to you,
*  to the extent that, and I do believe this,
*  that it's not capable of being created by anybody else,
*  and that feedback from other people about what we should do
*  or what we're good at, while it can be useful,
*  it's merely a calibration point for saying,
*  maybe you should do this, and you go,
*  or like, meh, or like, yuck.
*  Those are all just calibration points on this compass
*  to take you back to that feeling state.
*  So I apologize for not having a more concrete,
*  mechanistic works the first time works every time,
*  kind of instant tool like a physiological sigh.
*  Rather, this is going to have to be some self-exploration,
*  but the good news is, you're 17, your brain's still plastic.
*  The good news is, all of us are capable of neuroplasticity
*  throughout the lifespan, and the good news is,
*  all of us are capable of introspection
*  throughout the lifespan.
*  So even if you can't remember, you can sense,
*  and if you can sense, what you're doing is you're feeling.
*  What is this?
*  I don't want to turn this into a neuroscience lesson,
*  but I'd be remiss if I didn't say
*  that you're perceiving and feeling on the basis
*  of converting physical information in your environment,
*  sound waves, photons, mechanical pressure,
*  chemicals going in through your nose and mouth.
*  You're converting that into electrical and chemical signals.
*  That's what being and perceiving really is.
*  It can't be anything else.
*  So there's something about the way that you're wired,
*  Oscar, that is different and leads you to say, yum.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that, that, that.
*  And for me, I've always associated
*  with a certain physical sensation in this arm.
*  Don't ask me why, I don't even know.
*  And if you can sense into what it is
*  that gets you going in that direction,
*  if any and all of us do that,
*  then I really believe you can sense into your unique gifts.
*  Or maybe you just need to sit back
*  and think in deliberate, complete sentences
*  for an hour like Rick or one of those other geniuses.
*  I don't have a better answer.
*  That's the best I can do.
*  Thanks so much.
*  Yeah.
*  Thanks.
*  Thanks.
*  Thanks.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you so much.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thanks so much.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you, Rick.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you so much.
*  So just as a final note this evening,
*  I just wanna thank everyone for coming out.
*  As Rob mentioned, you know, come out.
*  As far as I know, there's no alcohol here.
*  People are here, amazing.
*  An event with no alcohol on a Saturday night
*  in this beautiful Sydney summer where we talk science.
*  Thanks for letting me tell some stories, learn some stories.
*  My real wish, my deep wish,
*  is that everyone do some level of introspection,
*  if not tonight and going forward.
*  And I so appreciate that people are interested
*  in the concepts around science and health.
*  And the really big, big wish for me,
*  maybe I'll even just call it an ask,
*  is that I truly don't develop the protocols.
*  I mine them.
*  Occasionally I develop them,
*  but I mine them from the rich sources
*  of information in papers and elsewhere
*  and put them into a format
*  that I'm deeply appreciative people enjoy digesting
*  and hopefully apply, but hopefully share.
*  And I certainly don't need attribution.
*  None of them are named after me intentionally
*  because that's not gonna give them any information
*  about what they do or how they work.
*  And last but certainly not least,
*  thank you for your interest in science.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you to the Sydney Opera House Trust
*  for their hospitality and for making this event possible.
*  And last but certainly not least,
*  thank you for your interest in science.
