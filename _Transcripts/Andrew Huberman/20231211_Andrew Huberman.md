# Dr. Karen Parker: The Causes & Treatments for Autism
**Andrew Huberman:** [December 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccrbE0QHy94)
*  Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
*  where we discuss science
*  and science-based tools for everyday life.
*  I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology
*  and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.
*  My guest today is Dr. Karen Parker.
*  Dr. Karen Parker directs
*  the Social Neurosciences Research Program
*  at the Stanford University School of Medicine.
*  The goal of her laboratory's research
*  is to understand the biological basis
*  of social functioning at every stage of the lifespan.
*  So this includes the bonds that form
*  between infant and parent, or parents,
*  as well as the bonds that occur between children
*  as they grow up, which of course form the template
*  for social functioning when we become adults.
*  Dr. Parker's research is heavily focused on autism,
*  and indeed on all forms of autism spectrum disorders.
*  Today we discuss autism,
*  we talk about the prominent theories
*  and current understanding of the biological basis
*  for autism, as well as what still remains mysterious
*  and unresolved about the causes of autism.
*  You may have heard that the incidence,
*  or perhaps just the diagnosis of autism,
*  has dramatically increased in the last 10 to 15 years.
*  And today we discuss why it is, in fact,
*  that the incidence, not just the diagnosis,
*  but the incidence of autism has so dramatically increased.
*  And perhaps most excitingly,
*  Dr. Parker shares with us brand new research findings
*  from her laboratory that point to a new understanding
*  of what causes autism,
*  as well as a novel treatment for autism.
*  Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize
*  that this podcast is separate
*  from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
*  It is, however, part of my desire and effort
*  to bring zero cost to consumer information
*  about science and science-related tools
*  to the general public.
*  In keeping with that theme,
*  I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
*  Our first sponsor is 8Sleep.
*  8Sleep makes smart mattress covers
*  with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
*  I've spoken many times before in this podcast
*  about the fact that sleep is the foundation
*  of mental health, physical health, and performance.
*  Now, a key component of getting a great night's sleep
*  is that in order to fall and stay deeply asleep,
*  your body temperature actually has to drop
*  by about one to three degrees.
*  And in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized,
*  your body temperature actually has to increase
*  by about one to three degrees.
*  One of the best ways to make sure
*  that those temperature changes occur
*  at the appropriate times, at the beginning and throughout,
*  and at the end of your night when you wake up,
*  is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment.
*  And that's what 8Sleep allows you to do.
*  It allows you to program the temperature
*  of your mattress and sleeping environment
*  such that you fall and stay deeply asleep easily
*  and wake up each morning
*  feeling incredibly refreshed and energized.
*  I've been sleeping on an 8Sleep mattress cover
*  for almost three years now,
*  and it has dramatically improved the quality of my sleep,
*  so much so that when I travel and I'm at a hotel
*  or an Airbnb and I don't have access to my 8Sleep,
*  I very much look forward to getting home
*  because my sleep is always better
*  when I sleep on my 8Sleep mattress cover.
*  If you'd like to try 8Sleep,
*  you can go to 8Sleep.com slash Huberman
*  to get $150 off their Pod3 mattress cover.
*  8Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, UK,
*  select countries in the EU and Australia.
*  Again, that's 8Sleep.com slash Huberman.
*  Today's episode is also brought to us by Element.
*  Element is an electrolyte drink
*  that has everything you need and nothing you don't.
*  That means zero sugar
*  and the appropriate ratios of the electrolyte.
*  Sodium, magnesium, and potassium.
*  And that correct ratio of electrolytes
*  is extremely important because every cell in your body,
*  but especially your nerve cells, your neurons,
*  relies on electrolytes in order to function properly.
*  So when you're well hydrated
*  and you have the appropriate amount of electrolytes
*  in your system, your mental functioning
*  and your physical functioning is improved.
*  I drink one packet of Element dissolved
*  in about 16 to 32 ounces of water
*  when I wake up in the morning,
*  as well as while I exercise.
*  And if I've sweat a lot during that exercise,
*  I often will drink a third Element packet dissolved
*  in about 32 ounces of water after I exercise.
*  Element comes in a variety of different flavors,
*  all of which I find really tasty.
*  I like the citrus, I like the watermelon,
*  I like the raspberry.
*  Frankly, I can't pick just one.
*  It also comes in chocolate and chocolate mint,
*  which I find tastes best if they are put into water,
*  dissolved, and then heated up.
*  I tend to do that in the winter months
*  because of course you don't just need hydration on hot days
*  and in the summer and spring months,
*  but also in the winter when the temperatures are cold
*  and the environment tends to be dry.
*  If you'd like to try Element,
*  you can go to drinkelement spelled lmnt.com slash Huberman
*  to try a free sample pack.
*  Again, that's drinkelement.com slash Huberman.
*  Today's episode is also brought to us by Aeropress.
*  Aeropress is similar to a French press for making coffee,
*  but is in fact a much better way to make coffee.
*  I first learned about Aeropress well over 10 years ago
*  and I've been using one ever since.
*  Aeropress was developed by Alan Adler,
*  who was an engineer at Stanford.
*  And I knew of Alan because he had also built
*  the so-called aerobie frisbee, which I believe at one time,
*  perhaps still now held the Guinness Book of World Records
*  for furthest thrown object.
*  And I used to see Alan, believe it or not,
*  at parks around Palo Alto
*  testing out different aerobie frisbees.
*  So he was sort of famous in our community
*  for developing these different feats of engineering
*  that turned into commercial products.
*  Now I love coffee.
*  I'm somebody that drinks coffee nearly every day,
*  usually about 90 to 120 minutes
*  after I wake up in the morning, although not always.
*  Sometimes if I'm going to exercise,
*  I'll drink coffee first thing in the morning.
*  But I love, love, love coffee.
*  And what I've personally found is that
*  by using the Aeropress,
*  I can make the best possible tasting cup of coffee.
*  I don't know what exactly it is in the Aeropress
*  that allows the same beans to be prepared
*  into a cup of coffee that tastes that much better
*  as compared to any other form of brewing that coffee,
*  even the traditional French press.
*  The Aeropress is extremely easy to use
*  and it's extremely compact.
*  In fact, I take it with me whenever I travel
*  and I use it on the road in hotels, even on planes.
*  I'll just ask for some hot water
*  and I'll brew my coffee or tea right there on the plane.
*  If you'd like to try Aeropress,
*  you can go to aeropress.com slash Huberman.
*  That's A-E-R-O-P-R-E-S-S dot com slash Huberman
*  to get 20% off any Aeropress coffee maker.
*  Aeropress ships anywhere in the USA, Canada,
*  and over 60 other countries around the world.

*  And now for my discussion with Dr. Karen Parker.
*  Dr. Karen Parker, welcome.
*  Thank you, it's great to be here.
*  This is going to be perhaps one of the longer conversations
*  that we've been able to have over the years,
*  in part because whenever I see you on campus,
*  we're heading in our respective directions,
*  but I'm very excited because the topic of autism
*  is one that is on a lot of people's minds.
*  And I think the first question that always comes up,
*  it seems, is whether or not the frequency of autism
*  is indeed increasing or whether or not the field of medicine
*  is getting better at detecting
*  what was always there over time.
*  Do we have any clear answers to that?
*  Well, I think it's a multifactorial answer.
*  So we're getting better at detecting autism, right?
*  So in the past, we were diagnosing kids
*  at nine or 10 years of age, right?
*  And now clinicians are able to reliably diagnose kids
*  at two to three years of age, right?
*  So there's more people.
*  There are pediatricians have autism screeners now.
*  So when you bring in your baby,
*  and over the first couple years of life,
*  you're filling out screeners
*  that are looking for autism symptoms, right?
*  So there's just a lot more awareness around autism.
*  But the rates have increased to now one in 36 US children
*  have a diagnosis of autism, which is over two years ago,
*  it was one in 44.
*  So-
*  One in 36.
*  Wow, I feel like it was just yesterday when it was one in 80,
*  but is one in 36 the average across boys and girls?
*  Does it skew differently if you look at just male birth
*  versus female birth?
*  Yeah, that's a great question.
*  So autism is male biased and prevalence.
*  So you have, and again, the studies vary.
*  I mean, it's worth noting that autism
*  is a highly clinically heterogeneous disorder,
*  which means that if you've met one kid with autism,
*  you've met one kid with autism, right?
*  So we have to bear that in mind as we have this conversation,
*  but different studies show that about for every one girl,
*  there's three to four boys that are impacted by autism.
*  So there's differences in the prevalence rate.
*  And also there's different monitoring sites.
*  So the way in the US that these data are generated
*  is the CDC has 11 monitoring sites across the country.
*  And so they follow children,
*  and then that's where the prevalence rates come from.
*  And they release new prevalence rates every few years.
*  So if physicians are able to detect autism early,
*  say in a two-year-old or a three-year-old,
*  to imagine that they're working off of tests
*  that don't rely heavily on language,
*  because even though you can get some verbose
*  two and three-year-olds,
*  most two and three-year-olds
*  don't have a very extensive vocabulary.
*  And I'm guessing that they're also relying
*  on things like visual gaze, among other things.
*  We've already made clear that this is not a discussion
*  to allow people to diagnose themselves or others.
*  But with that said,
*  what are some of the diagnostic tools that people use?
*  Is it language, is it vision?
*  Does it present as abnormal auditory processing?
*  Maybe you could give us a sampling.
*  So autism is a behavioral diagnosis, right?
*  So unlike other areas of medicine
*  where you might be able to take a blood test
*  or there's other sort of tools,
*  it's all a behavioral diagnosis by an expert.
*  So usually a psychiatrist or a psychologist.
*  And they look for two core features.
*  So this is based on the DSM-5,
*  and the two core features are pervasive
*  social interaction challenges
*  and the presence of restricted repetitive behavior.
*  But there are a lot of people with autism who have anxiety.
*  There are a lot of people with sensory challenges.
*  There are a lot of people with seizure disorders,
*  sleep disorders.
*  So again, it's each person with autism
*  has this sort of unique collection of traits.
*  And that's how they get diagnosed.
*  We're going to talk a lot today about interventions,
*  but how early are some of the behavioral interventions?
*  And I should just say,
*  any interventions introduced nowadays.
*  So if someone brings their child to the pediatrician
*  and they take one of these tests
*  and that child is deemed as having autism,
*  will the one-year-old or the two-year-old
*  immediately go into behavioral interventions?
*  Well, so usually you need to have the diagnosis of autism.
*  And then there are behavioral interventions
*  or a variety of different ones that are used.
*  There are some studies where,
*  because autism is highly heritable,
*  you can have one child with autism.
*  And then if you have subsequent children,
*  you're at an increased risk
*  of having subsequent children with autism.
*  And these are called baby sibling studies.
*  So what you're doing is enriching the population of infants
*  that you follow prospectively,
*  who are more likely to receive an autism diagnosis.
*  And there are studies where some of those children
*  are enrolled in behavioral studies,
*  even when they're quote unquote at risk.
*  I've heard before that parents in which one
*  or typically both parents are say of the engineering,
*  mathy, physics, quote unquote hard science type
*  are more likely to have autistic children.
*  Is that true?
*  I mean, did that bear out in the data?
*  If you look at profession or undergraduate major,
*  does any of that correlate with the probability
*  of having an autistic child?
*  Yeah, well, what I can say is that there's been some studies.
*  So what we know is that autistic traits
*  are continuously distributed across the general population.
*  And there was a study and there's a couple different
*  instruments that are used to be able to measure
*  these autistic traits.
*  So there's something called the social responsiveness scale.
*  And then that's a US based instrument.
*  And there's an autism quotient that's a similar measure
*  that was designed in England.
*  And what we know from work with the AQ
*  is that individuals that are in intense STEM fields
*  like engineering, physics and math
*  have a greater burden of autistic traits
*  even if they don't have an autism diagnosis.
*  Okay, so that leads me to wonder whether or not
*  this whole business of a spectrum
*  is actually multiple spectra, spectrums.
*  Is it spectrums or spectra?
*  Someone will put it in the comments on YouTube.
*  We know that for sure.
*  Please let me know.
*  I would like to know what is the plural of spectrums?
*  Spectrums, you know, because when we hear the word spectrum
*  we think, okay, there's a spectrum of severity, right?
*  And in fact, I have some experience with severe autism,
*  not in my family, but where I went to undergraduate
*  university, UC Santa Barbara, down the way from that school
*  was the Devereux School, which was a school which,
*  it's been there for a long time,
*  that parents would send their kids if they were
*  quote unquote severely autistic.
*  It was actually where Dustin Hoffman went to study
*  for his role in Rain Man.
*  The kids who were really delightful,
*  they used to come into town every once in a while
*  to the coffee shop where I'd study,
*  and they would also continue on from there to Kmart,
*  which is why the Dustin Hoffman character would say,
*  gotta go to Kmart, gotta go to Kmart.
*  He would do that repetition.
*  That's fascinating.
*  That Kmart was down the road from our college housing
*  and the Devereux School.
*  Those kids were literally in a away from home facility
*  full time, and I spoke to some of the parents at one point,
*  and they were at that facility,
*  meaning the parents had sent their children away
*  to live there full time.
*  Of course, they'd get visits and they'd get visits home
*  because they were, I suppose we could say,
*  at the far end of some spectrum that made it,
*  at least to the parents' idea,
*  impossible for them to be at home.
*  Okay, now at the other end of the spectrum,
*  if one is just simply thinking in terms of severity,
*  I know people who have self-identified as autistic.
*  That's how they've referred to it,
*  so I feel comfortable saying that they've said,
*  I am autistic.
*  And they seem pretty high functioning,
*  meaning they have driver's licenses, drive cars,
*  are in healthy relationships,
*  and manage life apparently well.
*  They have some traits that, yes, I would agree,
*  are a little bit different.
*  So this is where we get into neurodivergence.
*  But I guess the point is, should we think about autism
*  as on a spectrum, or given the fact that there are these
*  collections of different traits,
*  could there be a spectrum of severity,
*  also a spectrum of more stereotype behaviors,
*  another spectrum that intersects with that,
*  that has to do with obsession with a particular topic?
*  You could imagine that there are 50 or 60 different spectri,
*  or spectrums, I still don't know which one to say,
*  and that when we talk about the spectrum,
*  we're really talking about something
*  that's in multiple dimensions,
*  and not just one line that goes from severe to mild.
*  Does that make sense?
*  Yeah, I mean, I think this is where understanding
*  the biological basis of behavior would then allow us
*  to be able to say, here's these different dimensions,
*  but not understanding the biology,
*  you're left with, okay, are we lumpers or splitters?
*  How do we think about this?
*  Because autism is highly heritable,
*  so there's about 40 to 80% of autism is genetic, right?
*  So these vary wildly, right?
*  But the common thinking is that the majority,
*  about 50% of autism,
*  is associated with common genetic variants.
*  And so the way that we've always thought about this
*  is that there is this,
*  autism is largely an inherited polygenic condition,
*  but what I mean by that is that you have a lot
*  of common variants that are additive.
*  And so if you think about this collection
*  of common genetic variants that underlie this spectrum,
*  so if you have less of a dosing
*  of some of these common variants,
*  you might see somebody who's higher functioning,
*  like you said.
*  And if you end up with one of these single gene,
*  highly penetrant disorders,
*  you might see severe intellectual disability
*  and sort of lower functioning
*  on the other end of the spectrum.
*  But I think that there is a lot that we don't know.
*  And what you're bringing up, I think, underlines
*  sort of an issue with autism,
*  which is common for many brain disorders,
*  which is like, if you don't understand
*  the underlying biological basis,
*  it also gets very difficult to diagnose and treat, right?
*  And that's where we are with a lot of different
*  psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders.
*  To date, has there been any specific neural network
*  that we can point to and say,
*  ah, that's the neural network that seems to be different
*  in people who are on the autism spectrum?
*  I saw a study published recently
*  that seemed to point to the idea
*  that the genes that are altered in autism
*  at least include a large number of genes that are altered,
*  the proteins that are the consequence of those genes
*  are altered and exist at the synapse,
*  at the connections between neurons.
*  And I'm asking it that way because
*  some years ago, I was at a talk on autism at Stanford
*  and someone raised their hand and says,
*  do we even know that autism is a brain issue?
*  Couldn't it be an issue of the immune system
*  or the cardiovascular system,
*  which at the time seemed like,
*  okay, gosh, of course it's a brain,
*  but wait, then you stop and you think,
*  that's a really good question.
*  How do we know it's a challenge of the brain?
*  I think that's a great question, right?
*  And there may be, people talk about autisms, right?
*  And so when you think about where the major player is,
*  we're at the infancy of thinking about this, right?
*  And so maybe for some people,
*  it's more of a brain-based disorder.
*  Maybe for some people,
*  it's the connection with the gut and the brain, right?
*  I think what's also really tricky, right?
*  So one thing that you have to ask is,
*  what are the barriers to progress
*  in understanding autism, right?
*  And so the way I think about this is that,
*  let's just take for a moment that this is a brain disorder.
*  How do you study it in people, right?
*  So it's very difficult to get access
*  to either cerebral spinal fluid,
*  which is a fluid that bathes the brain,
*  brain tissue biopsies.
*  It's very hard to get people,
*  especially children that are really impacted
*  into a brain scanner, right?
*  Cause they can't sit still.
*  They may have sensory issues.
*  They don't wanna go into a scanner, right?
*  So a lot of the tools that neuroscientists
*  or psychiatrists have to think about
*  looking at the brain are limited, right?
*  And then the other part is, how do you model?
*  So the other way we might think about getting access
*  or thinking about model systems.
*  What we need to do is think about the control animals
*  and we need to make sure that the species
*  that we're modeling them in
*  has features of control humans, if you will.
*  So we need to have complex cognitive abilities.
*  We need to have complex social skills.
*  We need to have an organism that has vision
*  as its primary sensory modality, right?
*  Potentially sleep consolidating.
*  So we need to think about all of those.
*  And the tricky part, I think until fairly recently
*  was that we were doing all of this work in mouse models.
*  And the control mice just fundamentally lack
*  many of the characteristics that are needed to model
*  autism with fidelity, right?
*  And I think that's, when we look at drug development
*  pipelines, about 50% of preclinical failures.
*  So that would be something that's tested in an animal
*  that works and then fails in a human clinical drug trial.
*  50% of those failures can be attributed
*  to poorly selected animal models.
*  And so I think part of where we will be getting traction
*  is picking, developing sophisticated models
*  as a sort of point of entry into being able to understand
*  some of these things that are really difficult
*  to study in people.
*  Yeah, it's such a key point.
*  And for those that have not heard of preclinical models,
*  preclinical models are non-human models.
*  So it could be mouse, could be non-human primate,
*  could be flies or worms for that matter.
*  But we're going to talk a lot about non-human primate
*  preclinical models and the work that you've been doing.
*  And of course, also the work that you've been doing
*  in humans, the other animal.
*  The other primate.
*  The other primate, right, exactly.
*  I love to remind people that we're primates,
*  old world primates.
*  So thank you for doing that.
*  So you've been talking about the genetic influences
*  on autism and of course genes and the environment interact.
*  It's never nature or nurture.
*  It's always an interaction.
*  And that isn't just about the epigenome.
*  It's also just about the fact that nature impacts the genome
*  and our genome impacts the way that we interact
*  with the environment, et cetera.
*  So what is the role of the environment in autism,
*  both the frequency and the presentation of autism?
*  So there are, again, lots of different epidemiological
*  studies.
*  So advanced parental age, prematurity,
*  severe prematurity as a risk factor for autism,
*  maternal illness during pregnancy.
*  So there's a bunch of different things
*  that have been associated with an increased risk for autism.
*  In terms of environmental influences
*  and how they can intersect with biology, one of the things
*  that I was really struck by in the early 2000s that,
*  at least by my read of the literature,
*  hasn't really gone anywhere was this idea that
*  was proposed by Pashko Rakesh, who
*  used to run the neurobiology department at Yale,
*  expert in brain neuroanatomy and non-human primates
*  and in humans, embryology, really a luminary of our field.
*  And he had a series of papers exploring
*  how the migration of neurons during early development,
*  you know, as you and I both know,
*  but most people out there probably
*  don't know because we haven't covered this in the podcast.
*  It's not typical dinner table conversation.
*  You know, when a human embryo is developing,
*  the neurons are born at one location
*  and they migrate out some distance
*  to their final resting place where then they grow out
*  their connections and connect with one another.
*  And that process of neuronal migration
*  is oh so critical for the eventual wiring of the brain.
*  And Rakesh had this idea that perhaps,
*  and I really want to emphasize perhaps,
*  that the more frequent incidence of autism
*  might be correlated with the increase
*  in early prenatal ultrasound.
*  And he had these papers published
*  in a number of really high profile journals,
*  including Proceedings of the National Academy and Science
*  and elsewhere showing that in a mouse model,
*  if you do ultrasound, with each successive ultrasound,
*  you got more migration errors.
*  Right, so to me it was an interesting example
*  of the environment, frequency of ultrasound
*  and cell migration having some sort of interaction.
*  But it seemed like it never went anywhere.
*  It never got tacked to okay, you should keep in mind
*  the number of ultrasounds that you're getting for your child.
*  And of course, ultrasounds are critical
*  for pregnant women to get because they can stave off
*  a number of developmental issues
*  and they're super important.
*  But you know, we've heard about ultrasound
*  within the scientific literature
*  and then occasionally we'll hear other theories
*  about okay, it's having two parents who are both engineers
*  and then we'll hear, oh, you know,
*  it's toxicity in the food environment.
*  We've heard hypotheses about vaccines
*  or the adjuvants that the vaccines are contained in.
*  In that large cloud of theories,
*  has anything really emerged from them as like,
*  okay, there really seems to be at least one major risk factor,
*  environmental risk factor,
*  because I feel like all those theories
*  can come up, get some popular press,
*  a bunch of papers are published,
*  sometimes those papers are retracted,
*  like in the case of the vaccines,
*  and then the theory kind of dies.
*  So is there any specific environmental influence
*  on autism that we can say, yes,
*  there really seems to be something there?
*  Yeah, I mean, it's a really spectacularly good question.
*  I think the tricky part about it is that every single person
*  that comes into a trial has a different genetic background,
*  and so until we can have these a priori stratified trials
*  where you could then, you know, as a good scientist,
*  you would only manipulate maybe one,
*  two variables at a time, right?
*  But when you're doing these large epidemiological studies
*  because you can't, it's very difficult to do
*  experimental studies, right,
*  especially with developing children,
*  I think that's an incredibly difficult study to do, right?
*  So there's been an interest in this field
*  of there's these neurogenetic syndromes
*  that have high penetrance for autism,
*  which basically means that you could have a disorder
*  or, you know, another genetic condition, let's say,
*  it doesn't have to be a single gene,
*  but that a lot of those kids tend to also get
*  an autism diagnosis, and so there's been work in,
*  like, so for instance, Fragile X is a good example,
*  where because autism is so diverse
*  in terms of clinical presentation,
*  that let's say you have a medication
*  that could work for a handful of kids in the trial,
*  you may not be statistically powered to see it, right?
*  So, you know, the way I think about the autism world
*  is there's so little we don't know.
*  So think about being in a dark room
*  and you have a flashlight,
*  and you only see where you shine the light, right?
*  And so if you think about a very heterogeneous,
*  genetically heterogeneous study,
*  it's gonna be very difficult to tease out these pieces
*  because an environmental risk factor
*  might be a driver for one kid, but not another, right?
*  And so I think what we need to do
*  is to have these genetically defined subgroups
*  of individuals and then be able to test
*  the gene by environment interactions
*  or in this genetically defined group of individuals,
*  can we test this certain medication
*  to see if it's beneficial for this subgroup of children?
*  Got it.
*  So you mentioned Fragile X,
*  which we know presents with autism-like symptoms
*  in some cases, and then I think of another disease
*  like Timothy syndrome, a mutation
*  in an L-type calcium channel,
*  which for those of you that don't know
*  what these L-type calcium channels are,
*  they're not just important
*  for the function of neurons in the brain,
*  they're really important for the function of neurons
*  and other tissues, including heart tissue, right?
*  So kids with Timothy syndrome have cardiac issues
*  and they have autism.
*  I think it's important for us to kind of explore this a bit
*  because in most people's minds,
*  kids with autism have autism
*  and occasionally they'll have other issues,
*  gut issues or heart issues or musculoskeletal issues,
*  but we often think that that's the consequence
*  of the autism, but oftentimes they have
*  multiple things going on and the autism actually
*  could be secondary or independent
*  of the other thing that's going on.
*  So this is what leads me back to this idea of a spectrum,
*  is it possible that what we call autism
*  is actually like 50 different disorders
*  or 50 different conditions,
*  depending on what one wants to call them?
*  I mean, what is autism really?
*  I mean, what does it really center around?
*  And I think here maybe it's useful to go,
*  like do we go to the diagnostic criteria?
*  Like, how do we decide if a child has autism
*  if they also have a bunch of other things
*  that are challenging them?
*  I mean, I think that that's the $64,000 question, right?
*  And again, in other areas of medicine,
*  so if you think about, let's think about cancer biology,
*  right, like decades ago, somebody would come in with cancer
*  and you would hit them with radiation chemotherapy
*  and that was the best that we could do, right?
*  But with the invention of a lot of molecular tools,
*  you can remove a tumor and you can do molecular profiling
*  and even have personalized medications made, right,
*  to attack that tumor.
*  And so, you know, what's really tricky
*  when you have a behavioral diagnosis
*  that's not biologically defined,
*  you see a lot of heterogeneity.
*  So it's incredibly difficult, I think,
*  to answer this question because we don't know
*  how many kinds of autisms there are, right?
*  Like there will be people who say,
*  if you have a disorder like Fragile X
*  or Potter-Willi syndrome or Timothy syndrome
*  or a variety of these other conditions,
*  there will be people who people,
*  I've heard clinicians say,
*  well, that's not really autism, right?
*  That's a piece of Fragile X, right?
*  But if it's a behavioral diagnosis
*  and they meet behavioral criteria,
*  it becomes this weird circular argument, right?
*  So like until we really understand what autism is,
*  I think that it's going to be very tricky
*  to start, you know,
*  sub-defining different aspects of the condition.
*  As we all know, quality nutrition influences,
*  of course, our physical health,
*  but also our mental health and our cognitive functioning,
*  our memory, our ability to learn new things and to focus.
*  And we know that one of the most important features
*  of high quality nutrition is making sure
*  that we get enough vitamins and minerals
*  from high quality, unprocessed or minimally processed sources,
*  as well as enough probiotics and prebiotics and fiber
*  to support basically all the cellular functions
*  in our body, including the gut microbiome.
*  Now, I, like most everybody,
*  try to get optimal nutrition from whole foods,
*  ideally mostly from minimally processed
*  or non-processed foods.
*  However, one of the challenges that I
*  and so many other people face is getting enough servings
*  of high quality fruits and vegetables per day,
*  as well as fiber and probiotics that often accompany
*  those fruits and vegetables.
*  That's why way back in 2012,
*  long before I ever had a podcast,
*  I started drinking AG1.
*  And so I'm delighted that AG1 is sponsoring
*  the Huberman Lab podcast.
*  The reason I started taking AG1
*  and the reason I still drink AG1 once or twice a day
*  is that it provides all of my foundational nutritional needs.
*  That is, it provides insurance that I get the proper amounts
*  of those vitamins, minerals, probiotics and fiber
*  to ensure optimal mental health,
*  physical health and performance.
*  If you'd like to try AG1,
*  you can go to drinkag1.com slash Huberman
*  to claim a special offer.
*  They're giving away five free travel packs
*  plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
*  Again, that's drinkag1.com slash Huberman
*  to claim that special offer.
*  Well, this is probably a good time for us to think about
*  the work that you've done in terms of trying to tack
*  the biology of social communication and behavior
*  that those things interact,
*  not just language, but also behavior,
*  to autism in humans using non-human primate models.
*  And then of course, to also discuss some of the work
*  that you've been doing in humans.
*  And we can't have that discussion
*  without first having a discussion about two neuropeptides
*  that I think most people have heard of at least one of them.
*  And I think there's a lot of misunderstanding about,
*  but you're going to clarify that for us,
*  which are oxytocin and vasopressin.
*  So before we dive into the important work
*  that you've been doing on vasopressin in particular,
*  but also oxytocin and autism,
*  what are oxytocin and vasopressin really?
*  Okay, so they're these small little peptide,
*  they're nine amino acids long, so very tiny.
*  They only differ by two amino acids.
*  And they're these ancient peptides
*  that are hundreds of millions of years old.
*  And in almost any species studied,
*  whether it's the current version,
*  you might have vasotocin or other mesotocin,
*  which are sort of precursor forms in other species,
*  but they're highly evolutionarily conserved.
*  And they're involved in social behavior
*  in pretty much any, it could be egg laying,
*  it could be, but reproduction and social behavior
*  across the phylogenetic taxa.
*  So house cats make vasopressin and oxytocin,
*  humans obviously make vasopressin and oxytocin,
*  and pretty much every other species
*  that has to interact with and connect
*  with other members of its species.
*  Especially mammals, right?
*  So oxytocin and vasopressin are pervasive
*  and mammalian species.
*  Do the different species tend to make oxytocin
*  and vasopressin in similar brain areas and tissues?
*  Yes, but not completely overlapping.
*  But I think the thing that the beautiful mystery about these
*  and the infuriating piece of them
*  is that because they're so structurally similar,
*  they can have similar effects.
*  And there's four receptors that they bind to.
*  So if you think about a hormone or a neurotransmitter,
*  so oxytocin, vasopressin, if you think about them
*  like a key and a receptor like a lock,
*  and you have to put them together to open a door,
*  open behavior, they can bind to these four receptors.
*  So it can be very difficult to disentangle
*  which one is acting and at which receptor
*  and where in the brain.
*  Oh, so oxytocin and vasopressin are chemically similar.
*  Yes.
*  Interesting.
*  And where would you say lies their greatest output
*  divergence, which is just nerd speak for it?
*  Is there an example of something that oxytocin does
*  that vasopressin doesn't and vice versa?
*  Yeah, okay.
*  So what's really fascinating is these two neurotransmitters
*  or hormones were discovered for their peripheral effects,
*  which basically means not in their brain,
*  but somewhere in their body.
*  And so oxytocin's involved in uterine contractions
*  and milk letdown and so was during lactation.
*  So people sort of always thought of it
*  as the female hormone.
*  And then vasopressin has, at least in the peripheral system
*  has been involved in urinary output regulation,
*  blood pressure.
*  And so we only knew about their physiological roles
*  as sort of classic hormones for decades.
*  And what was interesting is these naming conventions
*  are fascinating in medicine, right?
*  So you could name a virus after where it was first found,
*  or it could be named after somebody who discovered
*  the disease like Alzheimer's, for instance,
*  is a good example.
*  And what was interesting, oxytocin was only named once.
*  Vasopressin was named twice.
*  So it's either called arginine vasopressin
*  or antidiuretic hormone.
*  And so it had two different names.
*  And so as you can imagine, sometimes genes are named twice.
*  And so somebody in cancer is studying one gene
*  and somebody in autism is studying another
*  and they're not even communicating
*  because they don't even realize that they've,
*  at least historically, now we have all kinds
*  of gene annotation sites, so it's less likely to happen now.
*  But what was fascinating is these hormones were named,
*  oxytocin is Greek for quick birth.
*  So for decades, people only appreciated
*  their physiological roles.
*  But there are neuroanatomists saying,
*  hey, so these are both made,
*  they're made in a lot of different places,
*  but the action sort of happens in the hypothalamus
*  where they're made.
*  And there were anatomists that said, wait,
*  these sort of project back into the brain.
*  What are these doing in the brain?
*  And one of my favorite historical stories was,
*  I had a mentor, a colleague,
*  who I didn't train with,
*  but he was a real source of wisdom to me for many years.
*  And his name is Court Peterson.
*  And he told me this wonderful story
*  about this Duke zoologist named Peter Klopfer.
*  And Peter was studying ungulates, so sheep and goats.
*  And he wrote a story, a paper in 1971 called Mother Love,
*  What Turns It On.
*  And one thing about science is I love going back
*  and seeing where do the pearls of wisdom come from.
*  And so he wrote this and said,
*  oxytocin is orchestrating all these events of motherhood.
*  And there are sheep and goats in particular
*  that have offspring that are precocious,
*  meaning they're basically born ready.
*  Within an hour, they can run with the herd,
*  unlike our species, which is altricial,
*  meaning we have very helpless infants.
*  And mom needs to bond really quickly with that baby
*  if it's going to be running around
*  and you only, from an evolutionary perspective,
*  you wanna be investing in the baby that's yours,
*  not somebody else's, right?
*  And he hypothesized that it was oxytocin
*  that was being co-released into the brain
*  and during milk letdown,
*  that was what turned mother love on.
*  And that was really the beginning
*  of this whole field of thinking.
*  And so that opened up thinking about oxytocin
*  in rodent maternal care and a variety of other instances.
*  Can I just briefly interrupt you?
*  Because I find this so interesting
*  and I know it's interesting to everyone listening as well
*  because yes, and thank you for making it clear
*  that oxytocin has many different roles.
*  But this role of mother love and bonding to infant
*  has me needing to ask whether or not the idea was
*  that oxytocin is released in the mother
*  when she interacts with her own baby.
*  And that leads me to the question,
*  is oxytocin also released in the baby
*  in reaction to the mother?
*  And how long is that effect lasting?
*  Because in order to have a pervasive bond with that baby
*  and not just some other baby,
*  and of course we still have visual cues
*  and we know our baby versus another baby,
*  most instances, there are rare exceptions,
*  or perhaps not so rare exceptions,
*  but leaving those aside,
*  the mechanism that would allow for mother-infant bonding
*  and infant-mother bonding by way of oxytocin
*  presumably is something
*  that is literally changing their brains,
*  saying you are the center of my life.
*  And the baby of course is saying,
*  well, you are my life because you are the source of life,
*  certainly for the early part of life.
*  And nowadays it seems that that can extend well
*  into the teens and 20s for some people.
*  But how is oxytocin working?
*  Is it working over the course of minutes, hours?
*  Is there some specificity of this baby and this mom
*  that links them in some more pervasive way?
*  I mean, how is oxytocin doing this magic of bonding?
*  Yeah, I mean, it's very species specific, right?
*  So I think that, and you need to think about
*  the evolutionary history of the species, right?
*  So if you think about sheep or goats,
*  the early studies that were done are you,
*  the passage through the vaginal canal was what,
*  you know, so you had activated oxytocin receptors that way.
*  But if you gave an oxytocin antagonist,
*  meaning you would give into the brain
*  something that blocked the oxytocin receptor.
*  So if the oxytocin is being released into the brain,
*  but you have a pharmacological agent
*  blocking its ability to bind to its receptors,
*  these sheep and goats wouldn't bond
*  to their baby, for instance.
*  So literally the passage of the baby
*  out of the vaginal canal triggers the oxytocin pathway,
*  the release of oxytocin.
*  Right, and lactation does too.
*  Nature is so beautiful, because if you had to pick
*  one event to trigger the release of oxytocin,
*  if oxytocin's role is to create bonding with offspring,
*  that would be the event,
*  because that's a tough one to mistake.
*  Right. Right?
*  But what I will say, because I think you will,
*  you know, to avoid you getting attacked on Twitter
*  or wherever you might get attacked.
*  I'm gonna get attacked anyway.
*  If not for this discussion, then another one.
*  But I'm tougher than I look.
*  So, but it's really species specific, right?
*  So if you think about our species
*  and a lot of primate species,
*  we live in these extended family groups,
*  and that's how we evolved.
*  And so unlike a goat or a sheep that might live in a herd
*  where there's a lot of non-relatives,
*  we lived in a community of relatives, right?
*  And so we, and we do all kinds of care
*  of extended relatives.
*  And so you wouldn't necessarily expect
*  in a primate species where you have this long rearing history
*  where help from the family and bi-parental care,
*  where sort of everybody is sort of like,
*  it takes a village to raise the baby,
*  we readily adopt in our, in primate societies, right?
*  And so, you know, like I had a C,
*  I mean, I'll tell you something personal.
*  I had a C-section and had,
*  I had a lot of postpartum complications.
*  And so lactation didn't work out that well for me.
*  One of my friends would say I had massive DVTs
*  and pulmonary emboli.
*  And so I almost died after my son was born the first time.
*  And so I didn't have a vaginal delivery.
*  I couldn't-
*  DVTs, D-Vain thrombosis.
*  Yeah, and it was sort of like welcome to motherhood.
*  And I was in the ICU and had to get a filter put in,
*  an inferior vena cava filter to stop me from dying
*  because I had scattershot clots all over my lungs.
*  And so I didn't really, you know, I didn't,
*  I didn't do a vaginal delivery.
*  I had a C-section and I wasn't really able to lactate.
*  And man, I love that baby, right?
*  So, you know, I can give, you know,
*  what I will say is it's really different in primates.
*  And we don't really understand how bonding occurs.
*  But what I will say is that bonding between a mother,
*  you really need to think about
*  the evolutionary selective pressures.
*  So I was an evolutionary biologist
*  before I found neuroscience, right?
*  And so I really, everything I do,
*  I think about from an evolutionary perspective.
*  So, but it is, many people go into the oxytocin,
*  vasopressin field because they have a lot of questions
*  about social interactions, right?
*  Like I think if you think about us as being social
*  is actually one of the core characteristics
*  of our species, right?
*  So social interactions are rewarding from infancy.
*  They keep us alive, as you mentioned, right?
*  And so I think it's not an accident
*  that the way we think about disorder in our species
*  is many disorders are disorders
*  because of lack of social connectedness, right?
*  So it could be something like autism,
*  where, you know, there's these pervasive
*  social interaction impairments.
*  It could be something like drug abuse,
*  where, you know, a risk factor for drug abuse
*  is feeling, you know, socially disconnected and alone, right?
*  Social isolation or loss of a loved one
*  is a very strong predictor of the onset
*  of a stress-related depressive anxiety disorder.
*  In terms of when and how oxytocin is released,
*  you mentioned mother-infant bonding.
*  I think you said, yes, that the infant
*  is also releasing oxytocin, we think.
*  So it's bi-directional.
*  We think, I think most of the work has been done in mom
*  and again, this has not been really done well in primates,
*  right, so we're extrapolating this information
*  from species that have different
*  evolutionary histories than us, right?
*  So it's goats, sheep, prairie voles, mice, rats.
*  So what do we know about the role of oxytocin in humans?
*  I mean, we know it's there.
*  We presume, based on the animal models,
*  that it's involved in mother-infant bonding
*  and presumably romantic partner bonding.
*  At least you hear that a lot.
*  It was unfortunately nicknamed the love hormone.
*  And the reason it's unfortunate it was
*  is that while that might cue attention to oxytocin,
*  and I'm a big fan of people paying attention
*  to biological phenomena, it discards the other
*  and many roles of oxytocin.
*  But what can we say about oxytocin in humans, if anything?
*  Like, do we know that it does?
*  I mean, so we're assuming, based on the animal models,
*  that it does something.
*  I mean, this is very different than dopamine,
*  where there's tons of animal model data,
*  but there's brain imaging where we know
*  where dopamine is expressed, and do we even know
*  where oxytocin receptors are expressed in the human brain?
*  Presumably that information is out there.
*  Recently, but again, there's a lot of specificity.
*  And I think if you're thinking about disorders,
*  you would then have to study
*  those specific subpopulations, right?
*  And you need, you know, a lot of this work has been done,
*  so you have to think about how do we study it, right?
*  So the best way to study it would be to have radio tracers
*  where you could then, which we do have for dopamine
*  and other compounds, where you would then go and see
*  where after somebody's performed a task,
*  do we see, you know, activation, right, or uptake?
*  There are some imaging studies,
*  they're usually done giving intranasal oxytocin,
*  and then you basically ask questions about,
*  okay, we give you oxytocin intranasally,
*  which presumably enters the brain.
*  We could talk about reasons why we think that,
*  and then we have you perform on some task, right?
*  And so, you know, there's evidence if you give oxytocin,
*  it diminishes the amygdala's response to fearful stimuli,
*  right, so that it might have this sort of prosocial effect.
*  And it was actually data like that
*  that caused people to start thinking
*  initially about oxytocin.
*  And those were data on humans.
*  That's right, it reminds me that there was this brief moment
*  where oxytocin wasn't just being discussed
*  as the love hormone,
*  it was being discussed as the trust hormone, right?
*  Also, far too simple a heuristic,
*  but again, I think it's cool that the press picks up
*  on these things and at least tells people
*  about what's being discovered,
*  and we just always have to be careful
*  to not have it lead to the assumption
*  that that's the only role of a given hormone.
*  So it can reduce, apparently,
*  it can reduce the output of the amygdala in some way,
*  this brain area associated with threat detection.
*  And so you could imagine how that would bias the person
*  toward being more prosocial.
*  Right.
*  Have there been studies exploring the role of oxytocin
*  in making autistic children more prosocial?
*  And behind that question, I suppose,
*  is the assumption, you can verify or not,
*  that autistic children are less prosocial
*  than other children.
*  Is that true?
*  Or is it that autistic kids are just maybe more prosocial
*  with the one friend they really, really like?
*  I happen to know some kids with autism,
*  or however you wanna phrase it,
*  and they have close friends,
*  and they seem to really like those specific friends a lot.
*  Like, they seem very happy when they show up at the door
*  and all the hallmarks of healthy social mind,
*  but it is true that they are uncomfortable in groups
*  and where there's a lot of noise.
*  A busy birthday party is overwhelming for them,
*  but you see them playing with one or two friends,
*  and you could see all that and assume,
*  okay, this is just kind of an introverted kid.
*  Actually, it kind of reminds me of me.
*  I mean, I don't have a problem with crowds,
*  but I much prefer to be with a small group of friends
*  or one close friend.
*  I hear you, I'm that way too.
*  Right, so how do we think about this?
*  Okay, well, I would say the social features of autism
*  are interesting, right?
*  And so you might have,
*  there was an attempt a long time ago, like 1979,
*  there was a woman named Lorna Wing
*  who tried to subtype the social features of autism, right?
*  And so there could be people that are socially avoidant
*  and really just don't wanna have social interactions.
*  There could be kids that are active but odd,
*  which means that they have an interest in being social,
*  but maybe they don't read social cues right,
*  and they interact in ways that other kids don't understand
*  or could cause bullying, right?
*  Something junior high school.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  And that's often why some autistic kids
*  do better with adults, right?
*  Because adults know how to sort of channel discussions
*  with somebody who might be a little socially awkward, right?
*  But there's different phenotypes.
*  I mean, people having a disinterest in social interactions
*  could be that they're highly socially anxious, right?
*  And so there's a lot of studies that make eye contact
*  makes them anxious.
*  You can see that in the slide.
*  So you can see that in the slide.
*  So again, that's another caveat.
*  There have been some studies administering oxytocin
*  to individuals with autism.
*  And again, these are these single dose studies.
*  So the first studies that we did
*  were the single dose studies.
*  So there were a couple of studies
*  that we did that were very specific
*  to those studies.
*  So the first studies that were done
*  were looking at single dose oxytocin in males
*  because some of the, and we can talk a little bit
*  about why oxytocin versus vasopressin,
*  which vasopressin actually would have been my choice
*  based on the animal literature.
*  And we can talk about that.
*  But vasopressin was given to males
*  partly because it wouldn't,
*  the idea would be that the off-target effects
*  in the peripheral nervous system,
*  i.e. milk let down, uterine contractions
*  are not gonna happen in males, right?
*  And so it was deemed that they might be safer subjects.
*  Males are often also the go-to for research studies
*  as you may have talked about on your podcast before too.
*  Yeah, something that fortunately is changing.
*  Yes, absolutely.
*  Thanks to a mandate by the NIH.
*  Correct.
*  I had to just kind of smile slash raise my eyebrows
*  a little bit at the idea that,
*  the assumption that oxytocin administered to males,
*  yes, one can see why it wouldn't cause milk let down
*  or uterine contractions,
*  but of course there could be other peripheral effects
*  of oxytocin in males.
*  But they had to pick one, so they went with males.
*  Okay, so, and there is this higher incidence
*  of autism in males.
*  So it's not a terrible place to start.
*  You just would hope that they would also do
*  the experiment on females.
*  So they're doing this by nasal spray.
*  So intranasal.
*  One dose.
*  Correct.
*  And for reasons that I don't understand,
*  it's 24 international units.
*  And I think maybe somebody did the first study using it
*  and this is how science happens, right?
*  And it worked and so then everyone uses that protocol.
*  And so then there's been a lot of studies looking at,
*  there's one reading the mind and the eyes.
*  So can you look at pictures of somebody's eyes
*  and then ask what is the emotion that they're feeling, right?
*  After receiving this intranasal.
*  Oxytocin or placebo.
*  Where's your eye gaze going in a picture, right?
*  So one of the theories is that people with autism
*  may at least a subset of them lack social motivation.
*  They're not looking in the places like eyes
*  where you receive a lot of social cues
*  that are relevant to social communication.
*  And so some of these early studies showed
*  that a single dose of oxytocin in people
*  that had high functioning autism,
*  so they were verbal, like you said,
*  they could come in for studies,
*  and that it looked like it had some potential effectiveness.
*  And so there became a really strong interest in the field
*  to think about oxytocin potentially
*  as a therapy for autism.
*  And is oxytocin available over the counter?
*  Does it require a prescription?
*  I mean, you see sites that are selling it,
*  but that doesn't mean anything these days.
*  Right, yeah.
*  There's gray market, there's all sorts of stuff going on.
*  But I know people that have used oxytocin.
*  There's actually a market for,
*  and by the way, folks, I'm not suggesting this,
*  but someone the other day told me
*  that they've been regularly taking
*  oxytocin ketamine nasal inhalations
*  as part of their work with their licensed therapist
*  on PTSD type stuff relating to,
*  let's just call it relational trauma.
*  So that's happening.
*  But let's just think about oxytocin alone for the moment.
*  Are parents of autistic kids able
*  to buy oxytocin nasal spray?
*  No, so it would need to be written,
*  the prescription would need to be written by a physician.
*  And it's not on the market, right?
*  So there's one thing we should say
*  is there's only two drugs that are approved by the FDA
*  to treat autism, and they're both in isocotics,
*  which they treat associated features like irritability,
*  and they have off-target effects like weight gain.
*  And so we don't have any medications
*  that are currently approved in the US
*  or anywhere else for that matter
*  to treat the core features of autism.
*  Interesting and unfortunate.
*  And hopefully that will change in the not too distant future.
*  Do we know that children with autism,
*  people with autism,
*  because I'm gonna just sort of assume
*  that autism is stable over the lifespan.
*  Like if a child is diagnosed with autism,
*  are they going to be an adolescent and adult with autism?
*  So I would say that in a lot of cases,
*  autism has lifelong impact,
*  but there are people who outgrow their diagnosis.
*  There are people who respond well to behavioral therapy.
*  I mean, obviously it's not the cure-all for everybody.
*  There's lots of people
*  who go through intensive behavioral therapy
*  and probably see minimal benefit.
*  But I mean, it's certainly something that occurs in childhood
*  for the diagnosis occurs in childhood.
*  And for most people will then be present
*  across the lifespan.
*  So we could say people with autism,
*  because each study sometimes will have adults.
*  Sometimes you'll have teenagers, sometimes you'll have kids.
*  I'd like to take a quick break
*  and thank our sponsor InsideTracker.
*  InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
*  that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
*  to help you better understand your body
*  and help you reach your health goals.
*  I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
*  for the simple reason that many of the factors
*  that impact your immediate and long-term health
*  can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.
*  A major problem with a lot of blood tests out there,
*  is that you get information back about metabolic factors,
*  lipids and hormones and so forth,
*  but you don't know what to do with that information.
*  With InsideTracker, they make it very easy
*  because they have a personalized platform
*  that allows you to see the levels of all those things,
*  metabolic factors, lipids, hormones, et cetera.
*  But it gives you specific directives that you can follow
*  that relate to nutrition, behavioral modification,
*  supplements, et cetera,
*  that can help you bring those numbers into the ranges
*  that are optimal for you.

*  Is it known whether or not people with autism,
*  assuming they meet the criteria for being autistic
*  at that moment, have lower natural circulating
*  or active levels of oxytocin?
*  Because it's one thing for a nasal spray of oxytocin
*  to improve social functioning.
*  It's another to know that the effect is addressing
*  an underlying biological deficit.
*  Yeah, it's such a great question.
*  Okay, so we should unpack that
*  because there's been a lot of work in this area.
*  So the first question is
*  where are we measuring the oxytocin, right?
*  So we mentioned oxytocin has all kinds of effects
*  in the body as well as the brain.
*  And it's released into the blood,
*  but it's also released directly into the brain.
*  And there's variable evidence about if you measure it
*  in blood, is it a readout of the brain or not, right?
*  Or should you be looking at something like spinal fluid
*  that's maybe a better biochemical proxy of the brain?
*  Most studies, so what I will say is there were,
*  there's been a handful of small studies
*  where there has been some, you know,
*  there's been some benefit, maybe no benefit, small effects.
*  We did a study that was a small study at Stanford
*  and it was based on mouse genetic data.
*  And I'll sort of walk you through what we did.
*  So there's multiple mouse models
*  of these neurogenetic syndromes
*  where people have social impairment, right?
*  We can quibble about whether that's autism or not,
*  but that they have social impairment.
*  And so that there are this fragile X mouse,
*  there's a Potter-Willi syndrome mouse
*  which is the Magil-2 gene that gets manipulated.
*  And then there's a CatNap-2 mouse.
*  And in all of those instances,
*  when you genetically modify those mice,
*  you see a reduction of oxytocin in the hypothalamus.
*  And what's interesting is that in those instances
*  where you see this genetic modification,
*  you do see lower blood levels
*  in these genetically defined models.
*  What's really cool is you can give oxytocin
*  a cross development in those models.
*  And at least in the CatNap-2 mouse,
*  you can restore oxytocin neuron number two equivalent
*  of control animals suggesting that oxytocin
*  is doing something in these oxytocin deficient animals.
*  So these are not an oxytocin gene manipulation,
*  but these are these syndromes where you see
*  as a consequence of manipulating genes for these syndromes
*  that oxytocin gets knocked down.
*  And so our thinking when we went into our clinical trial
*  was what if it's blood oxytocin levels
*  that they're going to be a subset of individuals
*  that just make less oxytocin.
*  Humans, and that maybe those are the individuals
*  who stand to benefit the most from treatment.
*  And so we were the first group to ask,
*  across this range of individuals who showed up,
*  and we did in all the trials that we'll talk about today,
*  these are done with my colleague, Antonio Hardin
*  at Stanford who's a child psychiatrist.
*  And we always have double blind,
*  meaning that the investigative team is blind,
*  and that they are unaware, I should say,
*  they're unaware of treatment,
*  and then the families and the children are unaware.
*  And then they're randomized,
*  meaning there was an equal chance
*  you could get either drug or placebo,
*  and they're controlled, right?
*  Okay, so we asked if we know
*  what your pre-treatment blood oxytocin level is,
*  who's gonna benefit from treatment?
*  And we thought a couple really interesting things.
*  One was that the lower your baseline,
*  so your pre-treatment blood oxytocin level,
*  you showed much greater benefit
*  from the oxytocin intervention.
*  One intervention, one nasal spray?
*  This was four weeks, sorry, I should have clarified,
*  this is four weeks of treatment
*  being administered oxytocin twice a day.
*  So we saw effectiveness there.
*  Sorry to interrupt so much,
*  but just male and female subjects?
*  We did, but again, because autism is male-biased
*  in prevalence, even if you make this heroic effort
*  to over recruit, try to get more girls in,
*  in the study we usually try to aim for the prevalence rate
*  because it's difficult to get girls
*  just because there's fewer of them.
*  Got it, okay, but boys and girls were included,
*  they're taking oxytocin over the period of four weeks,
*  and if they started off with lower baseline levels
*  of oxytocin, you observed a benefit
*  of the oxytocin treatment in those individuals.
*  What about the individuals who had normal to high levels?
*  You didn't see much benefit, right?
*  And so that was a cue to me to think
*  that there may be a subset of individuals
*  that for whatever reason they have lower oxytocin
*  and that they may stand to benefit more from treatment.
*  And none of the prior studies
*  had looked at blood oxytocin levels,
*  and so what we had thought was that,
*  well, maybe if everybody had measured
*  baseline blood oxytocin levels,
*  maybe some of these,
*  maybe there would have been more positive outcomes.
*  So, but there's a lot of controversy in this field
*  about whether oxytocin is a treatment for autism, right?
*  So after we completed that trial,
*  there was a large multi-site,
*  what's called a phase three oxytocin treatment trial
*  that was done at, I think, five sites,
*  and they gave oxytocin for an extended period of time,
*  and they showed no benefit.
*  Were they looking to see who started off
*  with low levels of oxytocin at pre-treatment?
*  So what was interesting about that study,
*  and there were a lot of issues with it,
*  was that oxytocin is something where you have to,
*  if you look at it, it degrades.
*  That's kind of what I joke about, right?
*  So you need to take it.
*  When we go in, we have these really intense protocols,
*  so you go in and we have vacutainer tubes that are cold,
*  and we put them on ice,
*  and then the phlebotomist takes the blood from the child.
*  So a lot of technical gymnastics.
*  And then we make sure we spin it in a centrifuge cold,
*  and then we pipette it onto dry ice,
*  so we have very minimal loss of the signal.
*  And so if you don't adhere to those rigid protocols,
*  which is very difficult to do across multiple sites,
*  it can be very difficult
*  to get an accurate read of oxytocin.
*  And so I think, for me, it's still an open question.
*  They didn't see the blood oxytocin predicted response
*  in that study.
*  The data weren't provided in the paper.
*  It was just said that they didn't.
*  But it's still an open question.
*  And so that maybe that is the way,
*  so you give it acutely,
*  like in those early studies we talked about,
*  that maybe oxytocin diminishes fear.
*  We know that oxytocin decreases the stress axis,
*  the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis,
*  and then it can diminish anxiety in animal models.
*  So that's well established.
*  And in a former life, I was a stress researcher,
*  so I've spent a lot of time thinking about this.
*  But the sad thing is that once you have a negative trial,
*  there isn't a lot of interest
*  in funding the work going forward, right?
*  And so I think it's still really an open question
*  about if there is a subset of individuals
*  that could benefit from oxytocin replacement therapy, right?
*  And until there's money to do that work,
*  we may not ever know the answer.
*  Well, it will be important
*  for that work to be done eventually.
*  Hopefully, the field will return to it
*  despite whatever trends might be happening now.
*  I think it's important to know
*  for the parents of autistic children
*  whether or not there were any negative effects
*  of oxytocin administration,
*  in particular in the children
*  that did not benefit from oxytocin treatment.
*  The rationale is the following.
*  Well, of course, these things require a prescription.
*  If a parent has a child with autism,
*  especially if they're young enough
*  that the behavioral interventions
*  could possibly stand a good chance
*  of inducing neuroplasticity,
*  rewiring of the neural circuits
*  that underlie social connection,
*  well, then there's this time-limited window
*  in which those parents presumably are willing to try
*  most anything provided it's safe.
*  So let's assume, and I'm making up these numbers now
*  because I haven't seen this study,
*  but according to what you told me,
*  that let's say a third of the autistic boys and girls
*  that come in have low baseline levels of oxytocin.
*  They're the ones that are going to benefit
*  from this oxytocin intervention.
*  The other two thirds don't.
*  Well, given the difficulties of measuring
*  baseline levels of oxytocin,
*  most people don't have access to those kind of resources.
*  If it's safe to give oxytocin no matter what,
*  well, then if I were that parent,
*  I'd be knocking on my physician's door saying,
*  hey, give me an oxytocin spray
*  because my kid might fall into that one third category
*  if and only if it turns out that oxytocin is safe to give.
*  But if there's a risk profile that doesn't justify
*  that kind of shotgun approach,
*  well, then I wouldn't do that.
*  So is oxytocin spray safe?
*  And if so, why doesn't every physician
*  who has a patient with autism
*  give them oxytocin nasal spray?
*  Right, it's a great question.
*  And I know that, you know, I'm a parent of three children
*  and I know this sense of like,
*  you would do anything to help your child, right?
*  And so I think the tricky part is that,
*  it was the one thing I will say is that all of the studies,
*  and there's been many of them,
*  have shown that oxytocin is relatively safe
*  in a pediatric population, right?
*  The tricky part is I don't know,
*  there's physicians that really pay attention
*  to clinical trials and if they don't see a benefit,
*  they may not be willing to write the prescription, right?
*  So until we could identify a group of children
*  that could benefit, you know,
*  we need to create the opportunity for physicians
*  to recognize that this could potentially
*  still be a treatment, right?
*  But that work, you know,
*  but I think the tricky part and what I will say is,
*  and we can maybe talk a bit about vasopressin,
*  which, you know, my feeling is that if I was placing bets
*  and having to choose between these two,
*  my money would be on vasopressin.
*  Well, we are definitely going to talk about vasopressin
*  in detail.
*  I mean, the reason I mentioned that hypothetical scenario
*  is just the sense of urgency
*  and in some cases desperation that parents feel
*  and, you know, time's ticking.
*  And if oxytocin is safe, then, you know,
*  I guess I'll put in my vote that, you know,
*  parents should at least talk to their physician,
*  maybe even hand them the study to consider.
*  But I can also understand the perspective of a pediatrician
*  who says, well, listen, it was a small number of kids
*  that benefited, you're welcome to try it,
*  but I don't, you know, doesn't seem like the results
*  are that impressive.
*  But, you know, this gets to a bunch of larger issues
*  about, you know, medical care and randomized control trials
*  and the desperation of parents and kids
*  to treat neurodevelopmental challenges.
*  I just want to ask, because it feels relevant
*  in a real way, you know, if ultimately the goal
*  of improving symptom profiles in autistic kids
*  is about improving social cognition and social behavior
*  and that process involves rewiring of brain circuits,
*  neuroplasticity, is there any reason to think
*  that other approaches to inducing neuroplasticity
*  would be beneficial even if they're not
*  in the biological pathways that are disrupted in autism?
*  I think, for instance, about the now extensive use of SSRIs
*  for the treatment of depression.
*  Some cases it works, in some cases it doesn't.
*  Side effect profiles are a serious concern,
*  as I've discussed on this podcast before,
*  but ultimately we know that depression
*  is not a serotonin deficiency.
*  In most cases, SSRIs are atypical antidepressants
*  like repryron, wellbutrin, and things of that sort.
*  When they work, they probably work because of their ability
*  to induce or assist neuroplasticity.
*  Right. Right.
*  Also the trials on psilocybin are not really about psilocybin,
*  they're about neuroplasticity,
*  at least the trials for depression, right?
*  There may be other uses of psilocybin
*  that relate more directly to the effects of psilocybin.
*  But ultimately, you know, what we're talking about here
*  is the attempt to rewire the brain in a specific way,
*  whether or not it's assisted by oxytocin
*  or some other mechanism.
*  So the question is, are there trials happening
*  where people are exploring, say, psilocybin, MDMA,
*  which by the way we know increases oxytocin
*  and serotonin dramatically,
*  as well as things like atypical antidepressants,
*  in kids that have autism,
*  not because we think that those autistic kids
*  are deficient in any of the neurochemicals
*  that these drugs would target,
*  but that these drugs can help rewire the brain,
*  and ultimately that's what these kids need.
*  Right, it's a really great point.
*  And there might be subsets of kids, right?
*  There might be kids where there would be a medication
*  that would target other pathways,
*  but that potently releases oxytocin, right?
*  But there might be kids
*  that have an oxytocin deficiency, right?
*  But I think that that circles back to your point
*  at the beginning, or our point,
*  is that autism is a very heterogeneous condition,
*  and being able to know before you begin a trial, right?
*  Like, who am I gonna put into it,
*  and what is my primary outcome,
*  like one measure that I think is gonna move the needle,
*  right, like it kind of requires a crystal ball.
*  So there's a lot of guesswork that goes into this.
*  But I would very much like to see,
*  I will say one other thing that,
*  I have a colleague named Adam Guastella,
*  who's at the University of Sydney,
*  and he published a paper a year or two ago now,
*  suggesting that oxytocin may be most effective
*  in kids at younger ages.
*  And I don't quote me,
*  somewhere between two and five, or three and six,
*  or something like that.
*  We'll find the paper and put it in the show notes.
*  Yeah, but you know, so it could be,
*  to your point about neuroplasticity,
*  that oxytocin may be maximally beneficial in younger ages,
*  right, and if these studies or these hajpajas across ages,
*  and across sort of different social phenotypes,
*  finding that signal is really important, right?
*  And maybe age is a driver,
*  or maybe low blood oxytocin, regardless of what age you are,
*  or maybe in Adam's case,
*  if you recruit really young children,
*  you're likely to see a benefit,
*  just because the brain is wiring up,
*  and it's more plastic at younger ages.
*  Yeah, that's also a vote, in my opinion,
*  for early examination of kids, right?
*  Like parents really need to get autism screening,
*  and perhaps maybe the most important thing
*  is to make autism screening as available,
*  and as inexpensive as possible for everyone,
*  because of the importance of early intervention,
*  even if it's purely behavioral intervention,
*  but certainly if it's behavioral and drug intervention.
*  The clinic wait times are really long, right?
*  So you have to have a specialist
*  who's capable to diagnose autism,
*  and so you could have a clinic
*  where you're showing troublesome features,
*  and a parent wants to get their kid into a clinic,
*  and you could have a 12-month or 18-month wait time, right?
*  And so there are a lot of people that are thinking about,
*  are there laboratory-based tests that we can develop,
*  maybe either for detection or clinical referral, right?
*  So could we come up with a biomarker panel, for instance,
*  where we might be able to say,
*  wow, here's a panel where we think this child
*  is at reasonable risk for developing autism.
*  Can we make sure they're prioritized
*  for getting a diagnosis, right?
*  So we can get them an early intervention,
*  but right now we don't have that, right?
*  So having some sort of laboratory-based test,
*  whether it could be biological,
*  or if we could do something with eye gaze,
*  and there's a lot of companies working on these things now
*  to say this may not, you know,
*  and also, obviously, again,
*  autism is always controversial in this field, right?
*  There's so many different stakeholders.
*  A lot of clinicians will say,
*  well, I don't want a 30-second video clip
*  replacing expert clinical opinion.
*  There's good reasons for them to feel that way,
*  but I think if there was a way to prioritize people
*  that are in this line, you know,
*  we could get diagnoses faster.
*  Well, you wouldn't want false positives,
*  but I would think that a 30-second video clip,
*  provided it's of something useful,
*  is going to be more valuable than nothing,
*  given the time sensitivity.
*  What are some of the barriers to getting
*  this behavioral testing to be not just more prominent,
*  but pervasive?
*  Like, it seems to me that, well, I recall in school,
*  they gave us the hearing test.
*  We all marched on the bus.
*  We got the beep test, and, you know,
*  you know, for hearing challenges, we get vision tests.
*  You get the Babinski reflex test,
*  not the moment you come out of the womb,
*  but pretty soon after.
*  I mean, why isn't this stuff happening for autism
*  for every kid?
*  Yeah, it's not scalable, right?
*  So these interviews with parents and the tests that you do
*  can take hours, right?
*  And any given clinician,
*  even if they're working really long hours,
*  there just aren't that many people
*  that have the extensive training needed
*  to make these expert diagnoses, right?
*  And so I think that there's, you know,
*  clinicians that are doing the absolute best they can,
*  but they can only see a certain number of people a week,
*  right, and so-
*  Does it have to be a physician?
*  Sorry to interrupt.
*  Or could a well-trained technician do this?
*  Yeah, well, I mean, I think technically
*  it's a DSM diagnosis, right?
*  So it's usually somebody who has a clinical degree.
*  So it would be a clinical psychologist.
*  It could be a behavioral pediatrician.
*  It could be, you know, a child psychiatrist
*  or a child neurologist, but I mean, again,
*  that requires years and years of training.
*  And if we look in areas
*  where people have fewer access to resource,
*  I mean, particularly in impoverished areas,
*  the mean age of an autism diagnosis is years later
*  than in wealthy areas where, you know,
*  there's many different medical specialists
*  with parents, you know, that aren't working three jobs
*  and, you know, can sit waiting around, you know,
*  and really lobby and really advocate for their kids, right?
*  Because, you know, if they don't show up for work that day,
*  they're not gonna get fired from their job, right?
*  And so I think that, you know,
*  if there's some sort of solution
*  that allows there to be a more democratic approach
*  to saying we need a really quick way, like you said,
*  to be able to identify at-risk children,
*  especially if it's a blood test or something like that,
*  you know, it could be incredibly impactful.
*  Are there human trials exploring MDMA,
*  methylene dioxide, methamphetamine,
*  also referred to as ecstasy,
*  and or psilocybin for treatment of autism?
*  So I was aware that MAPS had an MDMA trial in autism.
*  I don't know what's happened with that.
*  Yeah, perhaps it's still ongoing.
*  I'll check the MAPS site.
*  I'm in communication with them from time to time.
*  I mean, the reason for asking, of course, you know,
*  but maybe in case some of the listeners don't,
*  is the MDMA causes these massive increases in serotonin.
*  That seems to be the major source of the MDMA effect,
*  so to speak, based on the work of our colleague,
*  Rob Melanka, and in at least one human study
*  comparing MDMA to very high dose oxytocin treatment
*  kind of ruled out the oxytocin spike that's induced by MDMA
*  as the source or the only source,
*  but of course these chemicals can synergize.
*  I mean, but based on its chemical profile,
*  oxytocin release, massive serotonin release,
*  dopamine release, and a propensity
*  to enhance neuroplasticity, I mean,
*  assuming all the safety protocols were there,
*  seems like not the perfect drug, but not a bad choice
*  if, of course, it's inducing the kind of plasticity
*  that someone with autism would be seeking.
*  Right, I mean, I think the tricky part,
*  especially in children, right,
*  is there's gonna be a reluctance
*  to potentially give them psychedelics, right?
*  And so, is there a way to modify the chemical compound
*  to be something that parents might be more willing
*  to give to their children, right?
*  Right, and I totally agree with that,
*  I guess, to play devil's advocate, not against you,
*  but, well, I'll just state it very directly,
*  and then I'll take the heat as necessary.
*  I mean, I've done two episodes about the drugs
*  that millions, tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions
*  of parents are already giving their kids for ADHD,
*  which include amphetamines, including dioxin.
*  Methamphetamine is actually a prescription drug
*  for a very small subset of kids with ADHD,
*  but things like Adderall, Vivance,
*  even methylphenidate, Ritalin, I mean, these are amphetamines.
*  They induce dopamine release and norepinephrine release,
*  and again, I'm not suggesting people give their kids MDMA
*  to try and ameliorate symptoms of autism,
*  but something chemically similar to it
*  ought to be developed or at least explored
*  in a human trial, in my opinion.
*  Well, time will tell.
*  I'll reach out to the MAPS group and see what's happening.
*  Let's talk about vasopressin,
*  because there's a lot to discuss there.
*  So you told us this is a molecule
*  that chemically is very similar to oxytocin.
*  Is it manufactured in the human brain and body?
*  Yes.
*  Okay, do we know a subset of the sites
*  that it's known to be produced,
*  and where some of its actions are?
*  You mentioned the kidney and the antidiuretic hormone roles,
*  but within the brain, what brain areas have neurons
*  that make vasopressin?
*  Or have the receptors for vasopressin?
*  The receptors are all over the brain,
*  and again, it varies depending on the species,
*  and the way the receptors are measured
*  are in post-mortem tissue, right,
*  which can be very difficult to get good samples, right,
*  and so we need to have that caveat going in.
*  But yeah, I mean, it's made in the hypothalamus,
*  and it's released all over the brain,
*  and there's vasopressin receptors all over the brain, right,
*  and what's really interesting about vasopressin,
*  I always sort of joke that oxytocin, you know,
*  always saw its day in the sun, if you will,
*  and that vasopressin was sort of the stepchild
*  that was like left, you know, sort of behind,
*  and the reason why I find this fascinating is, again,
*  I think back to my roots as a evolutionary biologist,
*  behavioral neuroscientist, and what was interesting
*  is that there were studies in the early to mid-1990s
*  showing that vasopressin was critical
*  for male social behavior, and so there was work,
*  you know, there was a variety of people,
*  and I think Rob Melenco mentioned this
*  on the podcast he did about, you know,
*  there was a group of people like Sue Carter,
*  Larry Young, Tom Insull, some of these early people,
*  and they gave vasopressin to male prairie voles,
*  and vasopressin was what induced pair bonding
*  with a female mate, and also paternal care.
*  And as I recall, those experiments were done
*  in the context of looking at polygamy versus monogamy
*  of these prairie voles.
*  Prairie voles versus like a different species,
*  so same genus but a different species,
*  so it might be a montane vole or, you know,
*  highly related but these other species,
*  so prairie voles are monogamous, the males.
*  For life?
*  Well, I mean, that was the mark.
*  50% divorce rate.
*  Yeah, that was, I don't think it's that bad,
*  but I think marketing.
*  They're doing better than we are as a species.
*  That's true, we should look to them for pointers.
*  And all the divorce folks are saying,
*  wait, why'd you say better?
*  I have some divorce friends that have said,
*  divorce is like the greatest thing,
*  so we always say like doing better, doing worse, right?
*  Anyway, that's a whole other podcast
*  and certainly not the Huberman Lab podcast,
*  or maybe it is, or will be, but yeah,
*  my understanding is that you have certain voles
*  that mate with almost exclusively with one other vole
*  for their entire lifespan and then you have other voles
*  located elsewhere that in those colonies,
*  they mate with lots of different voles,
*  so the males and females have lots of different partners,
*  raise young with lots of different partners,
*  mating with lots of different partners,
*  and that if you give these a press in,
*  then you can make the, I always wanna call them polyamorous,
*  but I don't know if they love each other.
*  I'm gonna anthropomorphize and assume
*  that they love each other.
*  The polygamous moles, not polyamorous,
*  but polygamous moles then become monogamous.
*  Well, yeah, I would say that is probably
*  not the take home message.
*  So the take home message would be,
*  they had, let's say that there was like the good voles,
*  right, which are the prairie voles,
*  and they were the ones that form these monogamous pair bonds.
*  Dad participates in paternal care with mom,
*  they co-raise babies together,
*  and then dad chases off intruders, right?
*  And then there's the more asocial voles,
*  and so these are like the montane voles,
*  and it's a complicated story,
*  but there's these montane voles
*  where males and females live separately,
*  females like maybe live on the male's territory,
*  the male mates with a few different females
*  absolutely doesn't provide any paternal care at all,
*  and the mom raises babies by herself, right?
*  So these are really the two models.
*  So this is like 1950s versus 2020s.
*  Yes, yes.
*  To broadly stereotype.
*  To broadly stereotype.
*  And if you give, okay, so for prairie voles,
*  they're sort of primed to form bonds
*  and to be the males to be good daddies, if you will.
*  And all you have to do is give them
*  a single injection of vasopressin,
*  and you know, or you can give an antagonist,
*  and usually the way they form the bond is through mating,
*  you put them with a female, they mate,
*  they cohabit for a bit,
*  there's been all kinds of parametric studies,
*  I can't remember how many hours it takes
*  to form a pair of bond,
*  but then you can do these things
*  called partner preference tests,
*  and then you can say, here's the guy that you mated with,
*  here's this guy you don't know,
*  and you can do it for males,
*  and you can do it for females,
*  and they pick their partner,
*  they choose to go hang out with their partner.
*  The montane voles, you know,
*  either after mating with somebody may either be equal,
*  or maybe they'll even go spend time with a new individual.
*  So the cleanest story was that prairie voles are monogamous,
*  montane voles are not monogamous,
*  but in the prairie voles,
*  you could give vasopressin instead of mated cohabitation,
*  and you could turn on a bond with somebody
*  after only living with them
*  for a very short period of time, right?
*  Or you could induce paternal behavior,
*  and I was working with a vole species in grad school,
*  I think the most interesting scientific experience
*  that I've ever had, right?
*  And you and I both know this, right?
*  When you're young,
*  you're actually the person doing the work, right?
*  As you become, you know, the head of your lab,
*  you're mostly writing grants and giving talks, right?
*  And then you get to hear about the super cool things
*  that everybody in your lab is doing, right?
*  Eventually the members of your laboratory
*  kick you out of the lab. Exactly.
*  They literally say like, get out of here,
*  you're leaving things in the wrong place,
*  whereas initially you're telling them,
*  hey, that's in the wrong place within a year or two.
*  For me, I think it took about four or five years,
*  but by about year six,
*  I was demoted to my office
*  to just write grants and write papers.
*  I was told that one time, I was back there,
*  and I tried to wait,
*  and I was like so excited what they were working on.
*  And they basically just said,
*  go write grants and bring in more money, right?
*  Like that was kind of their attitude,
*  like we get to be the ones who get to do the cool stuff.
*  So back when I got to actually do the science,
*  I remember I had this species where,
*  and again, I told you I came at this
*  from an evolutionary perspective.
*  So these were called meadow voles,
*  and I found them very interesting.
*  So when I showed up in my thesis advisor's lab,
*  I said I really wanna study oxytocin and vasopressin,
*  and I really wanna study voles,
*  and I know you have a vole species.
*  And she said, well, I don't have prairie voles,
*  I have these meadow voles,
*  and I'm studying them because they're so sensitive to light,
*  and they change their behavior based on light.
*  And she said, well, you can do what you want,
*  but our grants basically have to have a circadian component.
*  And so she said, you gotta work that in,
*  but then we kind of struck this deal.
*  So I was hanging out in the animal rooms,
*  and I thought it was really fascinating.
*  So she had animals that were either on short day lengths
*  or long day lengths, so the mimicking summer and winter.
*  And I was noticing that on winter day lengths,
*  the males were hanging out with the females,
*  and when the female had a litter, he was participating.
*  And I was like, whoa,
*  these are not supposed to be monogamous animals.
*  And so I went into the field research,
*  and they were doing all these radio telemetry studies.
*  And so if you-
*  I wish you'd probably explain what those are.
*  Putting a little transmitter under the skin,
*  it's painless for the animal,
*  but that allows the researcher to monitor the behavior
*  of the animal remotely without having to,
*  you know, put them in cages and stuff.
*  So this is like under field conditions.
*  And voles are everybody's favorite snacks.
*  So they have like a very limited lifespan in the wild.
*  I mean, like on the order of months.
*  And so like, if you have a short lifespan,
*  like you should just keep reproducing, right?
*  And so what was interesting is at the end of the summer days,
*  as you're going into winter,
*  territories collapse and males are found with females.
*  And they co-raise babies, it makes sense.
*  If it's, you're gonna have a litterer
*  and mom needs to get up to go eat,
*  you need somebody to sit there and warm those babies
*  or they're gonna die because they're gonna freeze to death.
*  So I started saying like,
*  wow, I think these metavoles are good dads.
*  Like I'm noticing this.
*  And so I told my thesis advisor,
*  I wanna study how oxytocin and vasopressin can,
*  maybe this is involved in tracking
*  these evolutionary mating strategies.
*  And so again, like the coolest experience I ever had
*  was on these males that were housed under short day lengths.
*  So they were like winter males.
*  I was able to put vasopressin directly into their brains
*  and it was like turning on a light switch.
*  And they ran around the cage, picked up all these babies,
*  put them in a nest and huddled over them.
*  And if you put a placebo into their brain, nothing happened.
*  And so to me, I always filed that away in,
*  in the back of my mind of like, wow, vasopressin
*  is this really interesting hormone.
*  And maybe someday I will,
*  I did a postdoc on something else,
*  but it was always back in the back of my mind of,
*  I really wanna return to this.
*  It's so incredible that a eight amino acid long peptide
*  could basically turn these relatively negligent fathers
*  into very attentive fathers.
*  Yes, yeah, it was fascinating.
*  I mean, it just speaks to the power of the peptide,
*  vasopressin also speaks to the power of brain circuitry.
*  It also speaks to the idea that brain circuitry
*  is often sitting latent in the background,
*  ready to be activated.
*  That it's not just about neuroplasticity
*  and building up a new circuit,
*  that some forms of neuroplasticity are about unveiling
*  what's already there.
*  And that peptides can act like switches.
*  Which, it kind of makes sense on the one hand,
*  but I've never heard of a result as dramatic as that.
*  So I'm presuming you're gonna tell us
*  that that then led you to go back to vasopressin
*  and explore its ability to induce good parenting
*  in negligent fathers.
*  No.
*  I haven't studied that yet.
*  No, so I think that, my mom always says,
*  chance favors the prepared mind.
*  And so I was doing my postdoc at Stanford
*  and I got recruited to stay on the faculty.
*  And I had been doing work in stress vulnerability
*  and stress resilience.
*  And I really, and I love doing that work.
*  But I still felt this tug of,
*  I had spent all this time in a psychiatry department
*  where I was surrounded by clinicians.
*  And I realized that a lot of the stuff that I was doing
*  had clinical relevance, right?
*  And so sometimes you sort of meet the moment, right?
*  And so right as I was transitioning
*  to have my own lab in my department,
*  there was a bunch of stuff going on.
*  So there were a lot of very dedicated parents
*  who were lobbying for funding for autism research
*  because it was horrifically underfunded.
*  Really?
*  Horrifically underfunded.
*  Wow, I mean at rates of one in 36 kids.
*  Well, not at the time, right?
*  So it was one in 150 or whatever it was back then.
*  But there were all these parents,
*  and I mean, again, they're heroes in my eyes
*  that they advocated so much for their loved ones.
*  And so there was, they started forming
*  parent grassroots organizations that have culminated.
*  They all started joining together,
*  which is now Autism Speaks.
*  And then there was a man named Jim Simons
*  who runs one of the most successful hedge funds in the world.
*  And he decided, wow, I'm gonna,
*  let's put money into autism, right?
*  And so there were-
*  Does he have a personal link to autism?
*  I, you'd have to ask him.
*  Because oftentimes, not always,
*  but oftentimes when you hear about wealthy donors,
*  devoting a lot of money to one area of science,
*  there's a familial thing there.
*  A member of their family or a close friend
*  has this challenge,
*  and they really wanna see that challenge.
*  Absolutely.
*  I mean, a lot of money I've gotten for my lab
*  from philanthropists.
*  And what I will say is the most impactful work
*  I've ever done is through philanthropy, right?
*  They're crazy ideas that no funding agency ever touches.
*  But yeah, so they both put a lot,
*  there was a lot of emphasis.
*  And so because the Simons Foundation
*  started issuing requests for applications,
*  there was a group at Stanford that formed,
*  and it was a clinician with a basic scientist.
*  And my chair at the time said,
*  well, almost nothing is known
*  about the biological basis of autism.
*  Why don't you go,
*  I'm gonna introduce you to the head of child psychiatry.
*  You should go talk to this group.
*  And so as I was preparing my slides
*  and realizing that social interaction impairments
*  were a core feature of autism,
*  I thought, wow, these neuropeptides may really be
*  a part of this puzzle.
*  And so that's actually really how I got pulled
*  into autism research was through that.
*  And it was, everybody at the time
*  was very interested in oxytocin.
*  And I remember thinking,
*  so we actually did probably the most definitive
*  blood oxytocin study because there was this idea,
*  again, like this marketing campaign
*  of the oxytocin deficit hypothesis of autism.
*  And given how clinically heterogeneous autism was,
*  we got money actually from the Simons Foundation
*  and we did the first study with maybe 200 kids.
*  And what we were able to show was that blood oxytocin
*  was not a marker of autism.
*  So it wasn't like there was a bimodal distribution,
*  meaning two completely non-overlapping levels of oxytocin
*  in people with autism, people without autism.
*  So the lower your blood oxytocin levels,
*  actually, regardless of who you were,
*  you could be a child with autism,
*  you could be an unaffected sibling with autism,
*  or you could be a unrelated control child.
*  And it was the lower your blood oxytocin levels,
*  the greater your sort of social difficulties.
*  And the slopes were different.
*  They started at different points
*  because the behaviors were obviously different.
*  But that's what got us thinking about our clinical trial,
*  which is that blood oxytocin level is not going to be
*  this great differentiator between people
*  with and without autism, right?
*  But we might be able to find a subgroup
*  who could benefit from treatment.
*  But what I like so much about your approach,
*  the way you described it, is that it sets aside,
*  we don't wanna say discards,
*  but it sets aside this thing that we call autism,
*  which is already hard to define and diagnose
*  and there's all these different spectrums in here,
*  and just says, okay, children with autism
*  have challenges in social cognition,
*  social behavior, social bonding.
*  So do adults with autism for that matter.
*  Let's just focus on that.
*  And not worry so much about whether or not
*  somebody is diagnosed as autistic or not,
*  and just focus on what are some of the potential
*  neuropeptide deficits or over-expression of neuropeptides
*  that may in some way relate to those social challenges.
*  And then one can circle back to the question about autism
*  in collecting those data.
*  But it also points to this idea that when we go after
*  a disease like Alzheimer's, we can often miss
*  the possibility that Alzheimer's, while it has deficits
*  in cognition and memory, could also be a bunch
*  of other things like a metabolic disorder of the body.
*  And so maybe you go after a particular symptomology
*  and try and attack that and you might actually
*  potentially treat or cure multiple diseases.
*  And so very different approach.
*  And I hope people are catching on to the subtlety,
*  but also the potential impact of that.
*  Because if I heard correctly, you said there are people
*  who are not autistic who have social functioning deficits.
*  And they too have less circulating oxytocin.
*  Right, so I would say we haven't studied people
*  where we brought them in and characterized it, right?
*  So these are typically developing kids,
*  but what we did is in the abilities that are typical
*  of a control child, we still saw that gradient, right?
*  And so I think it just sort of begs the question about
*  what is oxytocin's role in human sociality, right?
*  I mean, I think there's just so much that we don't understand
*  about both of these molecules in terms of their
*  disease liability if they're low or their healing potential
*  if we are able to use them as modulators of other therapies.
*  So how did you move from oxytocin to vasopressin?
*  You mentioned that everyone was all excited about oxytocin,
*  still the one that we hear the most about.
*  Although after this podcast episode,
*  and when I start blabbing about vasopressin to everybody,
*  maybe that'll change, but I think it's gonna take
*  a lot more than that.
*  But maybe it's because the name isn't as...
*  There's something about oxytocin that kind of sounds like
*  the love, looks like the love hormone,
*  but vasopressin should be renamed.
*  Right, well it is something...
*  It should be called something else,
*  not antideroetic hormone, not vasopressin.
*  I mean, you're gonna tell us how critically important it is,
*  perhaps even more important than oxytocin,
*  for autism and social functioning.
*  So I don't know, by the end of this podcast,
*  we'll come up with a new name.
*  It's needed, right?
*  Well, I'll put it out there.
*  Okay, so how did you get to vasopressin?
*  Okay, so it was interesting with oxytocin,
*  because we didn't...
*  And again, I was skeptical that we would see
*  these big group differences, but it was a little bit of like,
*  okay, what everyone's saying,
*  this is not gonna be the big solution, right?
*  And so I actually came at it from the work
*  that we did in Monkeys.
*  And so I think I mentioned previously
*  at the beginning of the podcast,
*  that there were a lot of limitations that I saw
*  and then sometimes if you come into a field,
*  when you're a little bit of an outsider, right?
*  Like I'm not a clinician, I don't see autism patients,
*  but I also have this really strong interest
*  in social behavior and the biology of it.
*  And so I was thinking about,
*  what are things that we need to do
*  to better address the challenges in autism?
*  So one of them was, why are we looking in blood, right?
*  If you look at neurological conditions,
*  there has been a lot of progress made
*  by doing biomarker discovery in cerebral spinal fluid, right?
*  So the biological substrates or clues of markers
*  of say, various forms of dementia or MS
*  were first found in spinal fluid, right?
*  Because it's the fluid that bathes the brain
*  in the spinal column.
*  And so if you're looking for the biochemistry of an illness,
*  that's the closest fluid that you can get to the brain, right?
*  Blood draw just won't do it.
*  Maybe, right?
*  So that was part of my thinking.
*  But then there was the issue of the animal models, right?
*  So there was drug after drug after drug
*  that was tested in mice
*  and they failed in human clinical trials.
*  And so it made me start thinking,
*  could we develop a primate model
*  of naturally occurring social impairments, right?
*  So can we, because in autism,
*  these social impairments are, if you will,
*  naturally occurring, right?
*  And so this is the spontaneously occurring children.
*  And so it made me wonder,
*  could we identify monkeys in a large colony
*  that have social impairments
*  and after talking to clinicians who treat these children,
*  can I spend a lot of time validating a monkey model
*  where there will be monkeys that have features
*  that look like they have direct relevance
*  to core autism symptoms?
*  And so what I did was there's a primate center,
*  the California National Primate Research Center.
*  And so what we did is, so I think I mentioned earlier
*  that there's these surveys that can be used
*  to look at autistic traits
*  in the general human population, right?
*  And so we refined one of these
*  and we did what we call back translates.
*  So basically it's an instrument that's used for humans
*  and then what we did is modified it
*  to be able to use this rating scale in rhesus macaques,
*  which are an old world monkey
*  and I know you're familiar with them.
*  And I was interested in looking at old world monkeys
*  because they're some of the closest relatives to human
*  that are used in biomedical research.
*  And as I mentioned previously,
*  these autistic traits are continuously distributed
*  across the general human population
*  and that this genetic, say, let's call it genetic liability,
*  which is a fancy way of just saying
*  that we think that there's a genetic risk
*  that underlies this continuum of behavioral traits, right?
*  So if we think that that's true in humans
*  and in one of our closest relatives
*  and we think that some of these genes create proteins
*  that then are what sets up the developing brain
*  to develop in the way that autistic brains develop.
*  So let's just assume that that's the premise.
*  That's what we went in with.
*  Can we find rhesus macaques
*  that are just living in large outdoor colonies
*  and identify animals that might be good models for autism?
*  And the answer is yes.
*  We could do this all kinds of different ways.
*  One is we could just take people
*  and score monkey behaviors outside their cages
*  while they're interacting with their peers.
*  We can use rating scales.
*  And again, the rating scale we use,
*  it's called the social responsiveness scale.
*  So this is called the macaque social responsiveness scale
*  revised, it's a mouthful.
*  But what it allows us to do
*  is measure autistic-like traits in monkeys.
*  And we can also bring monkeys in for experimental tests
*  to see where their eyes look or how do they perform?
*  How do they respond to videos of other monkeys?
*  If they're making affiliative overtures,
*  do they do like macaques go-go?
*  Which is a positive response.
*  Well, they do that, right?
*  I'm going to apologize for interrupting again,
*  but I just had to tell people this
*  because I spent time up at the UC Davis Primate Center
*  as a graduate student.
*  And by the way, what we're referring to here
*  are non-invasive observational studies, at least thus far.
*  So these are monkeys living in large exclosures,
*  not enclosures, large exclosures,
*  forming colonies and social relationships.
*  And I think anyone that sees monkeys at the zoo,
*  and we all learn that monkeys go eee, eee, eee,
*  and they don't eee, eee, eee.
*  If you want a monkey to like you,
*  you learn this working with macaques.
*  First of all, they don't eee, eee, eee.
*  The affiliative call is a hoo, hoo.
*  They do this really nice.
*  And the little ones, the babies-
*  You do that very well.
*  I spent a lot of time with these monkeys.
*  And the little ones, they do this thing where they go,
*  I used to nurse the little ones every once in a while.
*  They go hoo, hoo.
*  And they're just, you know, it just like makes your heart melt.
*  I think there must've been an oxytocin dump at that moment.
*  That's probably happening right now.
*  But if you want the monkeys to like you,
*  you have to give an affiliative facial gesture,
*  which is not a smile.
*  That's actually an aggressive gesture.
*  So as Karen, Dr. Parker just showed you,
*  it's lip smacking, which is,
*  so if you see a monkey at the zoo
*  and you want it to pay attention to you,
*  you're gonna have to lip smack.
*  And if it doesn't, either you're not doing it right,
*  or it just doesn't like you.
*  Exactly.
*  Right, great.
*  All right, thanks.
*  Now we'll go back to the study of,
*  or the establishment of this really key experiment.
*  Right, so then what we did is we identified these animals
*  and we spent a lot of time.
*  So one of the things that I do as one of my areas
*  of expertise is validating animal models.
*  So a lot of, like I mentioned,
*  like a lot of reason why experiments fail
*  is people will take an animal off the shelf and say,
*  oh, I'm gonna do this, right?
*  But if you're studying a disorder
*  that's characterized by visual issues,
*  is it the best thing to do in a nocturnal species
*  that has olfaction as its primary sensory modality?
*  You're referring to mice.
*  Right, or is it better?
*  And again, I will say all models have value.
*  There's reasons, you just have to,
*  you basically have to stand by what you're modeling.
*  And so I think one of the biggest issues I have
*  with this sort of mouse phenotyping mafia
*  is that there's this group of tests that they use
*  and they use it in every single disorder, right?
*  And then if there's a positive hit, it's like,
*  oh, this test is really for Parkinson's today,
*  but it's for depression tomorrow, right?
*  And so my goal was to devise very specific tests
*  that would allow us to evaluate
*  core features of autism in this model.
*  And the answer is we found it, right?
*  So if you look at monkeys that spend a lot of time alone,
*  they have a much greater burden of autistic-like traits
*  measuring on this rating scale.
*  They have diminished social motivation,
*  so other monkeys will come up and interact with them,
*  but they don't engage in social overtures
*  that much themselves.
*  They do less grooming, less affiliative behaviors.
*  They, in some of the work that we're doing,
*  they don't lip smack back,
*  and we can talk a little bit about that.
*  We did a pharmacological probe
*  and we can talk a bit about what vasopressin does to that,
*  which is kind of exciting.
*  And so we spent a lot of time validating
*  this behavioral phenotype, right,
*  to say that we really feel like there are core aspects of it
*  that are allowing us to model autism, right?
*  And I have a paper which, if you wanna put it in,
*  it's all about creating this monkey model
*  and the power of doing it and where it took us clinically.
*  We'll provide a link to that in the show note captions.
*  I also just wanna throw up my vote
*  for the fact that you did this work,
*  because again, I don't disparage mouse model work,
*  but we've just seen over and over again
*  that the incredibly small fraction of mouse models
*  that lead to valid therapeutics in humans,
*  and that there's just a lot of differences
*  between primate brains and rodent brains,
*  and we have a very elaborate frontal cortex,
*  a bunch of other circuitry that mice,
*  if they have that, they probably use it for other things,
*  and it's just very hard to draw conclusions
*  from those models.
*  And they're great for probing functions
*  that are, let's just call them more autonomic type functions
*  and for doing some of the initial investigations,
*  but I think while I don't wanna see every research lab
*  switch over to primates,
*  I think one has to be really thoughtful
*  about the kinds of experiments one does
*  with primates at all.
*  This sort of behavioral assessment
*  and the identification of a primate model for autism
*  seems like a very good use of human resources.
*  Right, well, and the other thing I will say
*  is that there were medications
*  that were only tested in rodents
*  that when they were tested in people
*  had really negative consequences.
*  I can give you two examples.
*  One is thalidomide,
*  which was a morning sickness medication
*  that was given to women that were pregnant,
*  and the safety testing and toxicity testing
*  was done only in mice.
*  I didn't know that. Yes.
*  And that's why it went on the market.
*  It went on the market in Europe.
*  And there were all these children
*  born with profound limb abnormalities.
*  When they went back and tested the drug in marmosets,
*  neither rhesus monkeys or cinnamalgus monkeys,
*  or even an old world monkey,
*  they had the limb abnormalities.
*  And so all they had to do,
*  and again, I as an animal lover treat
*  the life of a single monkey,
*  or a single mouse for that matter,
*  an individual monkey, excuse me,
*  or individual mouse for that matter as critical.
*  I am a speciest.
*  I do think there's a difference
*  between their life and our lives
*  when it comes to what study one does.
*  But just the idea that these severe developmental defects
*  in humans could have been avoided by doing an experiment,
*  perhaps even on one marmoset.
*  Right.
*  And again, I feel for the life
*  of discomfort of that marmoset,
*  but the idea that that could have saved
*  so many human lives is just striking.
*  Well, and there was also that straight drug MPTP
*  that was a synthetic heroin, right,
*  that causes like overnight Parkinsonianism, right,
*  when like I think the dopamine cells were just ablated,
*  right, but when you went and looked in mice,
*  MPTP didn't have those effects.
*  It was only in primates and other,
*  humans and other primates, right.
*  So, and I agree with you.
*  I am an animal lover.
*  I think that we have to be very careful
*  whenever we do any animal experiments, right.
*  And so you really need to have a good justification,
*  I think for any science that's done.
*  I will say that upfront.
*  And we have this new generation of stem cell
*  and organoid work, which I think is going to allow us
*  to make all kinds of disease progress, right.
*  Without having to study whole animal models.
*  Or in complimentary, right.
*  But I mean, I think, again,
*  I think we need to pick the model
*  based on the question we're asking, right.
*  And so if you wanna have a medication
*  that's safe and well tolerated, you know,
*  when people were effective
*  and you wanna move the needle on complex social cognition,
*  you wanna be testing it in a species
*  that also has complex social cognition.
*  Look, the Netflix show, Chimp Empire,
*  people haven't seen it, they should watch it.
*  When you watch it, you realize they're very much like us.
*  And dare I say, we're very much like them.
*  It's far and away different than watching a bunch of mice.
*  And I'm not being disparaging of mice.
*  I'm assuming they have,
*  the mice also have complex social cognition,
*  voles also have complex social cognition,
*  but it's of the mouse, vole type.
*  And we don't know really even what to look for, right.
*  But with primates, there's, you know, affiliative gaze,
*  there's, you know, affiliative grooming,
*  there's ostracization of individuals in a troop.
*  I mean, there's a, you know,
*  banding, taking care of other babies.
*  There's all sorts of interesting dynamics
*  that map so clearly onto human behavior and vice versa.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  So you establish this colony up at Davis,
*  at the Regional Primate Center,
*  that, where you identified some monkeys that,
*  we don't know if they have autism,
*  but you could see that they were less socially affiliative.
*  Right. And I would never say they have autism.
*  Like I will say that upfront, you know,
*  they have features that resemble human autism
*  and that allow us to model this, right.
*  So, we started studying those animals
*  and what we wanted to do was do some biomarker discovery.
*  So what we wanted to ask was,
*  are there any molecules that allow us to differentiate these,
*  what we'll call them naturally low social
*  or low social monkeys from socially competent,
*  high social monkeys.
*  And so we measured a bunch of different readouts
*  of neurotransmitter systems that were either involved
*  in mammalian social behavior,
*  had been implicated in idiopathic,
*  meaning autism that doesn't have a genetic cause
*  or these neurogenetic syndromes that we've been talking about
*  where there's pathways that are really associated with them.
*  And so if we measured a bunch of these systems
*  with 93% accuracy without even knowing what the monkey,
*  who the monkey was, if they were low or high social,
*  we could just put them in the low social
*  or high social bucket.
*  And was this by blood draw or cerebral spinal fluid?
*  So this was, it was everything.
*  We did blood, we did CSF,
*  and we put all these measures into the hopper.
*  We did a discriminant statistical analysis,
*  which was like a machine learning algorithm
*  where we just said, here's all this information,
*  help me classify if this individual is high or low social.
*  Cerebral spinal fluid is collected by spinal tap, correct?
*  And my understanding, I've never had one,
*  but that spinal tap is of course more invasive
*  than a blood draw, but it still is done
*  as an outpatient thing in humans.
*  Like you can go in and get a needle inserted
*  into the lower spine by an expert.
*  They're gonna draw cerebral spinal fluid.
*  I mean, not that much more invasive and time consuming
*  than getting a needle into your vein for a blood draw, right?
*  I mean, it's, we think of it as,
*  it's technically a little bit more challenging.
*  But there's CSF draws in humans all the time.
*  So in theory, this could map to a human study.
*  And it did, which we'll talk about.
*  Very cool.
*  So we went out and we did this,
*  I have this spectacular statistician who's,
*  we spent a lot of time together, his name's Joe Garner,
*  and he is a statistical genius.
*  And so he developed this and we do all of our work together,
*  or I would say 95% of it, we just love working together.
*  And he developed a statistical winnowing strategy
*  to identify what were the key drivers.
*  And what was fascinating is in this first monkey cohort,
*  it was the cerebral spinal fluid levels of vasopressin
*  that were really what was driving this classification, right?
*  So if we just knew your levels of vasopressin
*  in spinal fluid, but not in blood, interestingly,
*  we could pretty closely perfect,
*  to perfect classify you as high or low social.
*  And so then we replicated that again
*  in another monkey cohort, because obviously as a scientist,
*  you always wanna replicate your work.
*  And then if it was really a biomarker,
*  meaning it's a molecule in the body
*  that gives us an indication of something,
*  and in this case, it's an indication
*  of your social functioning.
*  We were able to look at monkeys and we saw
*  that the vasopressin was consistent across measurement time.
*  So there was a wide variety of vasopressin levels,
*  but within an individual monkey,
*  it was pretty much the same, right?
*  So that's what you wanna see with a biomarker.
*  And then we showed that the vasopressin levels
*  were closely linked to time-spending grooming.
*  And as we mentioned, I think we mentioned earlier,
*  grooming is in many monkey species,
*  a critical behavior that solidifies social bonds
*  and maintains them.
*  And so the individuals with the lowest CSF vasopressin levels
*  had spent the least amount of time in grooming.
*  Grooming other monkeys.
*  Other monkeys, yes.
*  Yeah, this allopathic grooming is a very interesting
*  behavior from watching Chimp Empire.
*  I can tell you that new relationships are established
*  in many ways by monkeys, these chimps, chimpanzees,
*  sort of offering their back for grooming.
*  And if another chimp elects to yes, groom that chimp,
*  then it establishes some form of trust.
*  And it all seems to have to do with proximity.
*  Like how close are you gonna let me get to you,
*  vice versa.
*  In humans, we talk about personal space,
*  and there's a whole set of things related to consent
*  in this whole allopathic grooming thing.
*  And then if a chimp misbehaves on an outing,
*  then they aren't groomed by others,
*  and they can actually get parasitic infections,
*  and it can be very costly.
*  It's very interesting to just think of allopathic grooming
*  as not a kind of a primitive of language,
*  but a whole language into itself.
*  Absolutely, yeah.
*  And also just critical for the species.
*  So that was really interesting to me
*  that we were seeing these hints that vasopressin
*  could be really important.
*  But of course, somebody will say,
*  and I will say upfront, monkeys don't have autism.
*  So then the question becomes,
*  does this have what's called translational value?
*  So can I see this observation in an animal model,
*  and will it provide fundamental insights into humans?
*  And so I wanted to get cerebral spinal fluid from people
*  to test this hypothesis,
*  because we had in parallel done a study
*  looking at blood vasopressin levels
*  without autism,
*  and we didn't see a group difference there,
*  unlike this really profound difference that we saw
*  when we looked at spinal fluid in the monkeys.
*  And again, I think I mentioned the blood vasopressin levels
*  were indistinguishable
*  if you were high or low social monkeys.
*  So there was something about looking more proximate
*  to the brain that was giving us more information
*  than say the blood alone.
*  And so I said I wanted to get spinal fluid.
*  And like you said, people do this all the time.
*  How would we, but we're, you know,
*  it's not gonna be a first pass,
*  especially when we don't really have any evidence in people
*  to go in for what we would call
*  a research lumbar puncture, right?
*  And so I had to get really creative about
*  how do I get spinal fluid from children?
*  And what we did was we piggybacked onto
*  a clinical indication for a spinal fluid draw.
*  And we did this, so I tried to get funding for this.
*  This is like, you know, again, I mean,
*  I think this is important for people
*  to know how science is done, right?
*  And so I wrote all these grant applications,
*  nobody would fund it.
*  They said that this is really interesting,
*  it's too high risk, you won't be able to pull it off.
*  And you know, I don't usually back down from a challenge.
*  Like if I think something's a good idea
*  and I wanna do it, I'm gonna find a way to do it.
*  If somebody, if it's impossible, that's one thing,
*  but if it's hard to do, it doesn't mean you shouldn't do it.
*  You just have to figure out how to do it.
*  And so I always try to see bridges
*  where other people see barriers, right?
*  And so it's like, well, how can I access spinal fluid?
*  And so I went around talking to all my friends
*  who were on, and Stanford's really wonderful
*  because it's such a small school, right?
*  And so you're on all these different committees
*  with all these different people.
*  And so-
*  A lot of committees.
*  Lots of committees.
*  I can attest, a lot of committees.
*  Yes, exactly.
*  But it's really cool,
*  because you're on them with people
*  from all different departments.
*  Oh yeah, I know people in departments
*  that I wouldn't otherwise know.
*  And you get very, you get to know these people well
*  in these many committees.
*  And where we live, it's a small community, right?
*  So like-
*  A very worthy experiment, Karen.
*  Maybe there's a, I always wonder whether or not
*  there's a larger experiment, like not on monkeys,
*  not on the patients or the clonedrobe,
*  maybe worthy experiments.
*  Yeah, I mean-
*  And they're looking at how we interact on committees.
*  Anyway, please continue.
*  So I started going up to people that I knew and said,
*  hey, if you're taking spinal fluid,
*  can I get a little bit of extra, right?
*  And of course we got IRB approval,
*  meaning we had ethics approval and all this.
*  Or you could get the remnant sample,
*  and obviously again, get consent from the families.
*  So we could either get a little bit extra
*  when it was being drawn for a research indication.
*  So they were getting a spinal tap no matter what.
*  And then we were just either,
*  we're getting a little bit extra,
*  or we were gonna get the remnant
*  that they were gonna throw out, right?
*  So usually take more than you need
*  because you don't wanna have to do another spinal tap, right?
*  And so we were able to go around,
*  and I hustled around and got all these people involved
*  to help me.
*  We put hot pink stickers on the lumbar puncture trays
*  so that in the emergency room,
*  so if somebody was doing a spinal tap,
*  they would call us so we knew about it
*  and we could get samples, again, under people's consent.
*  So we got all these people involved,
*  and we finally got samples from children with autism
*  and children without autism.
*  And then we also made sure
*  that whatever they were being worked up for was negative,
*  right?
*  So we got the sort of healthiest people we could,
*  given that everybody was coming in for a medical reason
*  to have a lumbar puncture.
*  And in this first study, we had seven children with autism,
*  seven children without autism,
*  and we could nearly perfectly classify 13 out of 14
*  individuals by just knowing their CSF vasopressin level
*  alone, which is pretty remarkable given that there isn't
*  a biological indicator that we,
*  a robust biological indicator that we know.
*  So basically in this relatively small cohort,
*  having low vasopressin is a biomarker of autism.
*  Correct, and again, and what I will say
*  is in our monkey studies and in our human studies,
*  CSF oxytocin level became our control, right?
*  So in our monkeys, there were no difference
*  in CSF oxytocin by group.
*  And then in this first study, there were no differences
*  in CSF oxytocin levels.
*  A sample size of 14 is intriguing,
*  but given autism so clinically heterogeneous,
*  we wanna replicate it.
*  And so I knew that there was a professor at the NIH
*  named Sue Swedo who was collecting cerebral spinal fluid
*  as part of a research study because she was interested
*  in immune parameters and folate deficiency.
*  So she had children that were medically healthy
*  and they were getting, just like at NIH,
*  get these huge workups, right?
*  So they were very well characterized participants.
*  So we were able to look at, and again,
*  this is the first time we were able to look at girls.
*  So we had a small sample of girls and we had boys,
*  and we basically just asked the question,
*  can we replicate this?
*  And I was very interested in,
*  will oxytocin be what's different in the girls, right?
*  So maybe there will be some sex specificity here
*  and it will see low CSF vasopressin in the males
*  and low CSF oxytocin in girls.
*  That was not the case.
*  What we found was that in the individuals with autism,
*  regardless of their biological sex,
*  that they all had lower CSF vasopressin levels
*  than the individuals without autism.
*  And because they were so well characterized,
*  we were also able to show on a gold standard
*  research diagnostic assessment of autism.
*  So it's an assessment that's used in a research situation
*  to validate an autism diagnosis
*  by an expert clinical opinion,
*  that the lower your vasopressin levels in spinal fluid,
*  the greater your social symptoms severity,
*  your clinical symptoms severity.
*  And then we asked, it's like, well,
*  vasopressin's involved in social behavior,
*  but it's not really that involved
*  in restricted repetitive behaviors.
*  And that was actually the case.
*  So it was the CSF vasopressin
*  track the social symptoms severity,
*  not the repetitive symptoms severity,
*  suggesting that there might be other biological measures
*  that could be included as a way to have a more powerful way
*  to differentiate people with and without autism.
*  And so then I was really,
*  so that was really exciting to replicate that.
*  And then I had a colleague named John Constantino,
*  who is now at Emory, but he used to be at WashU.
*  And I knew that John, I had been at a meeting
*  in, I think it was 2010,
*  and I found out that he had what I will call liquid gold.
*  So he had this minus 80 C freezer
*  that had a bunch of neonatal infant CSF samples
*  that he had from human infants.
*  And he had collected them.
*  And again, this was under ethical approvals.
*  And it was basically these infants came in
*  for something that needed to be worked up
*  that was very rare, but if they had it,
*  they would, they could die.
*  So they needed to get a medical treatment for it.
*  But the vast majority of these children
*  ended up being healthy.
*  So it was a pretty healthy sample, if you will.
*  And so I knew he had all these samples
*  and I said to him, wouldn't it be really interesting
*  if we teamed up and we look at this CSF vasopressin finding
*  in children before the period
*  when behavioral symptoms first manifest, right?
*  And so-
*  Sorry again to-
*  Sorry, am I getting too jargony?
*  I'm gonna apologize every time.
*  No, no, I just, but I think it's important
*  because this was a question that I was thinking about earlier
*  and I imagine many other people were too.
*  You find these monkeys that have
*  social interaction deficits.
*  You find kids that have social interaction deficits.
*  And you see that there's low vasopressin in both groups.
*  This extends to male and female children.
*  But then of course the question becomes,
*  well, maybe they have low vasopressin
*  because of so many years or even months
*  of social interaction deficits, right?
*  That the direction of causality isn't clear.
*  And so when you said liquid gold,
*  referring to the CSF from these infants
*  taken prior to any opportunity for social interaction
*  beyond just whatever interaction they had with their mother
*  up until the point the CSF draw was taken,
*  this really gets at the issue of causality.
*  So it's a quasi perspective,
*  because it was banked and then a lot of time went by.
*  And so what we realized we could do was,
*  and this was a heroic undertaking on John's part.
*  So these samples were collected back
*  on paper medical records.
*  So he had to trace 2000 paper medical records.
*  What's that?
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  So he had to trace 2000, I think, paper medical records
*  to an electronic medical record.
*  And then what we did is he looked to see
*  who went on to develop autism and who didn't, right?
*  So then what we had was spinal fluid samples
*  that have sort of been waiting in the freezer, if you will.
*  And then we could ask,
*  do individuals who later receive an autism diagnosis
*  many months or even years later,
*  already have low vasopressin levels as infants?
*  And the reason why this was a compelling question to ask is
*  there's evidence to suggest that behavioral therapies
*  are more effective the younger the child is, right?
*  And if you think about it,
*  if behavioral characteristics of autism
*  emerge across development,
*  and this is sort of my,
*  we haven't substantiated this yet,
*  but this is like sort of my big question.
*  What if all these autism susceptibility genes,
*  some in interact and converge upon a few common pathways
*  in the brain, right?
*  And so for years, people have talked about
*  this excitatory inhibitory balance theory of autism.
*  But what if vasopressin is one of those pathways
*  because it's so critically involved in social functioning?
*  And so what I was interested in,
*  and so let's just say for a moment,
*  your genes are set at birth.
*  What if the vasopressin is already low
*  in the brains of these infants?
*  And so it puts them on this very different trajectory
*  where you have this cumulative effect of
*  there may be a little bit less socially interested
*  and maybe they're not making the eye contact.
*  And if there was a way to intervene really early,
*  even potentially with a vasopressin replacement therapy,
*  that you might be able to put them
*  on a different developmental trajectory.
*  So that was my big what if question.
*  And what was really remarkable was,
*  so I had been asking John,
*  hey, can I have your spinal fluid samples?
*  And he finally agreed after he saw a couple of those papers,
*  understandably he wanted to make sure
*  that we already had shown something in people and animals
*  that were sort of, if you will,
*  symptomatic with social impairment.
*  And what we found was yes, this was the case.
*  So it was a small sample, it needs to be replicated,
*  but individual, so infants that went on
*  to have an autism diagnosis later in life
*  already had low CSF vasopressin levels.
*  Oxytocin levels did not differ between infants
*  that received a subsequent autism diagnosis
*  and those that didn't.
*  So suggesting that we have a biomarker
*  that might really be a good readout
*  for clinical referral or risk management monitoring.
*  Incredible, so you're telling us that
*  levels of vasopressin correlate
*  with social cognition deficits, right?
*  I think that warrants a brief discussion
*  about cerebral spinal fluid.
*  I teach neuroanatomy to medical students,
*  so forgive me for having to ask this,
*  but I think of cerebral spinal fluid
*  as the stuff that exists in the ventricles
*  and down the central canal of the spinal cord
*  and provides essential nutrients
*  and for neurons and other cell types in the brain.
*  But it's also a reservoir for chemicals
*  coming from the brain, which is why
*  the spinal tap is useful.
*  But in the context of a cerebral spinal tap
*  and you're measuring CSF and you're seeing,
*  okay, lower levels of vasopressin in these individuals
*  with these challenges with social deficits,
*  does that mean that they're making less vasopressin?
*  Does it mean, I mean, it could have gone the other way too,
*  they're dumping too much vasopressin into the CSF
*  and it's not able to function in the brain.
*  What do we know about CSF and what does it mean?
*  Right, well, I mean, it's a great question.
*  So I think this is just the tip of the iceberg, right?
*  So I think of the CSF as sort of like
*  the kitchen sink of the brain, right?
*  And what we need is real specificity.
*  And so, I mean, my working hypothesis,
*  and we'll talk a little bit about pharmacology,
*  is that there's a deficiency in vasopressin production
*  in individuals with autism,
*  but there's a lot of elegant experiments
*  that need to be done to be able to answer this question.
*  So we have funding currently to look in post-mortem
*  human brain tissue, to look at in both blood, CSF
*  and hypothalamic tissue where vasopressin is made,
*  to look at inner relationships, right?
*  Which is very difficult to do,
*  but also to see if there's a fewer number
*  of vasopressin producing cells
*  and if vasopressin gene expression is diminished, right?
*  Cause that would help us begin to answer,
*  is this a production issue, right?
*  So if you think back to the prairie voles,
*  they're sort of primed to be parental, right?
*  Or in my case, the meadow voles, right?
*  But you can do this in any vole species,
*  or at least the two that I'm thinking of.
*  And you put vasopressin into the brain
*  and then all of a sudden it unlocks this behavior, right?
*  So is it possible that children with autism
*  or at least a subset of them,
*  all you have to do is replace vasopressin
*  and that there might be a subset of these kids minimally
*  that could benefit from vasopressin replacement,
*  if you will.
*  Is there any evidence for excessive urination
*  in kids with autism, which if anyone's going, what?
*  Why is he asking that?
*  If you recall, vasopressin is also anti-diuretic hormone.
*  I suppose the other question is,
*  could you, has anyone looked at levels of vasopressin
*  in the urine of autistic kids versus non-autistic kids?
*  Because it's acting peripherally and you said blood draws
*  don't reveal any differences in circulating blood.
*  We know that urine is filtered blood, fair enough,
*  but seems at least worth the look-see.
*  Okay, so I had this awesome medical student in my lab
*  named Lauren Clark and we,
*  with three different physicians from different backgrounds,
*  so wrote a perspective piece that's currently under review
*  and it actually asked this question.
*  So given all these weird medical naming conventions,
*  it's possible that this information is existing
*  in information silos in different disciplines, right?
*  So it raises this idea of if you have low vasopressin,
*  so there's a, if you really don't have,
*  you're not making vasopressin,
*  you have a disorder called central diabetes insipidus,
*  which is characterized by excessive thirst,
*  lots of urination, and bedwetting potentially.
*  And so what we wanted to do was ask,
*  has this been missed, right?
*  So shouldn't there be a subset of kids with autism
*  where we might be able to look
*  at these other physiological features and say,
*  yeah, this is the subset we wanna be giving vasopressin to.
*  And so she wrote this perspective
*  where we did a little bit of a review,
*  and the answer is there's some intriguing studies
*  that we reviewed in this paper where it looks like,
*  and what's funny is when you read the discussion section,
*  it'll be like, wow, there's all these kids with autism
*  that are drinking lots of water and we don't know why,
*  or wow, there's a lot of bedwetting,
*  but it's not tied to intellectual disability
*  where you might see a lot of bedwetting or something.
*  So all of these studies kind of raise this point of like,
*  wow, this is really interesting.
*  And there's been no big epidemiological study done on this
*  and certainly not any study where people
*  who come at it from brain science
*  and then the practitioners who are like an endocrinologist,
*  for instance, which is where some of these people
*  could show up, are really connecting the dots.
*  So I think that remains to be determined,
*  but we are actually about to launch a study
*  to investigate this, right?
*  I was meeting with Lauren yesterday about it.
*  So it's a really good question
*  and I hope to have information on it
*  in the not too distant future.
*  As I recall, alcohol is an antagonist of vasopressin.
*  So there's a lot of different drugs
*  that could interact with vasopressin.
*  And so one thing I'm interested in is,
*  are there any drugs that release vasopressin
*  as a side effect and could some of them be mobilized
*  to treat autism?
*  We also know that like acupuncture can release vasopressin.
*  There's been some studies done in rats on that.
*  And so one question would just be,
*  are there any alternative therapies
*  where we can be releasing vasopressin naturally?
*  Or do we need to do a replacement study
*  where we give intranasal vasopressin
*  to children with autism, right?
*  And of course, I wanna say I'm not advocating
*  that people go out and do this on their own, right?
*  Like I'm a big proponent of randomized clinical trials
*  where you assess safety, right?
*  And efficacy. Science.
*  Yes, science.
*  It's a science and medicine, right?
*  But I appreciate you saying that.
*  Yeah, some years ago, so this would be mid-90s,
*  there was a small but very active subculture
*  that I was not a part of, I swear,
*  that were combining GHB, gamma hydroxybutyrate,
*  and vasopressin as combination, quote unquote, sex drugs.
*  Really? Yes.
*  Yeah.
*  And I don't know what the rationale
*  for including vasopressin was.
*  In any case, whether or not that's by way
*  of enhancing social bonding
*  or a direct effect on sexual arousal itself
*  is still unclear, but in any event,
*  since we're talking about vasopressin,
*  maybe you should tell us about the actual science
*  of vasopressin.
*  Sorry, maybe I should allow you to tell us
*  about the actual scientific study of vasopressin.
*  In other words, what happens if you give people vasopressin
*  in a controlled environment?
*  Not the sort of environment I'm talking about,
*  but a controlled environment.
*  That's the first thing I will say
*  because I have people contact us all the time saying,
*  where can I get vasopressin?
*  And what I would say is vasopressin means
*  you're having effects on blood pressure,
*  you're having effects on really important.
*  Right, vasod.
*  Right.
*  And people. Vascular culture.
*  And the dosing has to be appropriate.
*  You don't want people just going and trying this
*  because there could be really severe adverse effects.
*  So that's why we've been studying this
*  in a controlled clinical trial.
*  So I teamed up with Antonio Hardin,
*  who's the child psychiatrist
*  that I've been working with for years.
*  And we did the first, sort of first in class,
*  vasopressin treatment trial in children with autism.
*  So again, this was, everyone was unaware
*  of who was on vasopressin,
*  whether it was the family or the clinician
*  who was doing the evaluation.
*  And then it was randomized, placebo controlled.
*  And then we basically gave vasopressin,
*  again, twice a day for four weeks to children.
*  And they were about six to 12 years of age.
*  And then we had a primary outcome measure,
*  which was the social responsiveness scale.
*  We could get into discussions about
*  what a primary outcome measure should be.
*  Wouldn't it be great if there was a biological measure?
*  But this is sort of what had been used in the past
*  and something that the FDA approved us using.
*  I was partly interested in using the SRS
*  because we had used it in monkeys, right?
*  And we had shown, at least in monkeys,
*  we've never looked at this in people
*  because of the lack of available samples.
*  But in monkeys, in this general population
*  that we've looked at,
*  there's a continuous distribution of these SRS scores
*  that relate to the CSF vasopressin levels.
*  And so what was, I wanted to know if we use the SRS
*  as an outcome measure and we're administering vasopressin,
*  can we change the scoring on this instrument
*  based on our animal data?
*  So SRS is social responsiveness scale.
*  Correct.
*  Without going into a lot of detail
*  because we can always refer people to the paper.
*  And I think most people just want to understand
*  the top contour.
*  The SRS presumably has to do with
*  how often the kid interacts with another kid,
*  how often they initiate that interaction
*  versus on the receiving end,
*  things like affiliative play,
*  how often they look at one another versus averting gaze,
*  these kinds of things.
*  And then there's also a little bit about
*  restrictive repetitive behaviors.
*  So even though it's called the social responsiveness scale,
*  there's also an assessment of other features
*  of autism in it.
*  But you can sort of think about it as a quantitative way
*  to assess features of interest in autism.
*  And this was related to our biology in the monkeys.
*  And so then we use this as this outcome measure
*  in our trial.
*  And as an experimentalist,
*  I have this sort of trust but verify.
*  So you wanna see the same thing
*  over and over and over again.
*  Scientists like repetition.
*  And so we had parents fill out their impressions
*  of what the child's behavior was
*  before and after being on the medication.
*  We also had a clinician make an evaluation,
*  but we also had the kids perform laboratory-based tests
*  where they would see, like I mentioned,
*  reading the mind in the eyes test.
*  Or we would show them a picture of a face
*  and say, what emotion is this?
*  And so we were able to have what's called
*  convergent validity, right?
*  So it's a fancy scientific term to say,
*  do all these measures that we think should be related,
*  are they related and are we seeing the same thing?
*  And the answer was yes.
*  So that when we gave children with autism vasopressin
*  versus kids with autism of placebo,
*  the kids who were treated with vasopressin
*  showed increases in social abilities on parent report,
*  clinician evaluation, and child performance
*  on laboratory-based tests.
*  Wow.
*  Was that immediate?
*  Like they did the nasal spray
*  and they immediately started receiving
*  and initiating more social engagement?
*  Or was this a buildup over time?
*  And what I'm getting at here is whether or not
*  this is the reflection of short or longer-term neuroplasticity.
*  Like were there structural changes in the brain?
*  Or is this something that was more acute?
*  We don't know the answer to that.
*  So we basically looked at dosing with the idea that we would,
*  and again, I think we've mentioned this about limitations
*  on like there's so many things
*  that a scientist would like to do,
*  but you were always limited by a budget, right?
*  And so when we started this work again,
*  it was like philanthropic shoestring budgets, right?
*  And so you had to really be laser focused
*  on what are the things that we can do on the budget at hand.
*  So unfortunately we didn't do like EEG or brain imaging
*  or other things that would be,
*  I think potentially very interesting to do
*  because you might be able to see
*  an early signature of response, right?
*  So maybe after the first dose, let's say,
*  wow, like there's some interesting changes
*  that are predictive of somebody
*  who would be a responder to the medication.
*  And we don't know that yet.
*  But we do know after this four week period
*  that we saw these changes.
*  And then in a subset of kids,
*  we actually saw diminished anxiety
*  and also diminished restricted repetitive behaviors.
*  So suggesting that the vasopressin effect
*  may not only be on social behavior.
*  Have you ever just wanted to try or tried vasopressin?
*  You know, I haven't, but I think-
*  You're in a psychiatry department after all.
*  And I'm not suggesting that members
*  of the psychiatry department are constantly testing
*  the drugs that they use on their patients with themselves.
*  But, but I've had several members of this department
*  of which I'm a courtesy member, member by courtesy.
*  In any event, we'll see if I'm still am
*  after what I'm about to say.
*  Dr. Carl Deisseroth, who's a clinician,
*  our first guest on the Human Lab podcast,
*  also a phenomenal neurobiology researcher,
*  David Spiegel, Rob Malenka,
*  and others that I've spoken to.
*  You know, I think all of whom said, you know,
*  that they felt as clinicians,
*  Rob's not a clinician, but anymore, right?
*  But as a clinician, that they felt almost a responsibility
*  to understand the effects and side effect profiles
*  of the drugs that they were giving their patients,
*  which I saw not as renegade or experimental,
*  but rather as a very compassionate, like seeking empathy.
*  So I'm curious, have you ever just snuck a little, no?
*  No, I never have.
*  But there is a long history in medicine
*  of people trying out, they believe so much
*  in their solution that they go and vaccinate their family
*  with the new vaccine that they've created,
*  or they try the medication themselves, right?
*  So I don't-
*  MDMA was developed by Sasha Colgan
*  in a laboratory in the East Bay,
*  first by a pharmaceutical company in the early 1900s,
*  but then kind of disappeared, it did disappear,
*  and then it was resurrected independently
*  in the 1970s and 80s, and then now it's one of the
*  sort of hot topic items for the treatment of PTSD,
*  still in late phase clinical trials, still illegal,
*  but self-experimentation is one of the central themes
*  in psychiatry, frankly.
*  Yeah, I mean, I guess I got in trouble in class
*  for being too social, right?
*  So I guess I've never-
*  It might send you over to the other side.
*  Yeah, yeah, exactly, who knows?
*  But no, I never, no, and the thing is,
*  is that these oxytocin and vasopressin,
*  and again, these are done, and this is something
*  that I think we've hit on over and over again
*  in the podcast, is you need to know who's,
*  you're studying, right?
*  What's the species, who's the individual?
*  Most of these have been done in,
*  a lot of the oxytocin and a little bit of the vasopressin
*  work, the single dose work, was mostly done
*  in what we'll call neurotypical people, right?
*  Just asking, can we move around social behavior
*  by just giving the single drug administration?
*  Most people that are neurotypical didn't say
*  that they could tell if they were on the drug
*  or the placebo, right?
*  Interesting.
*  So I think the question really becomes,
*  drugs have different, they work differently
*  based on the individual who's taking them.
*  So if you have a neurotypical individual
*  and you give them vasopressin, maybe they'll self-report
*  that they don't see a difference,
*  but if you had somebody who isn't producing
*  enough vasopressin, maybe they would self-report
*  after a period of time, or maybe even after the first dose,
*  wow, I really see something different, right?
*  Did any of the kids report how they felt?
*  I just said, wow, I like playing with other kids more.
*  Were they self-aware in that way?
*  And also feel free to mention, if it feels right to you,
*  any, let's consider two outlier cases.
*  One spectacular result if that, a kid that went
*  from very socially isolated to maybe very gregarious,
*  but let's also balance that with another outlier,
*  the kid with low vasopressin who took vasopressin
*  for whom there was no significant shift.
*  I'm presuming that within the data set,
*  you probably observed something like each of those.
*  Yeah, so what I'll say is that,
*  so yeah, there were definitely kids
*  who didn't respond to the medication.
*  One thing I think it's important to say,
*  and again, this was a small pilot trial, right?
*  We're in the process of replicating this
*  in a much larger sample.
*  So as a scientist, again, you wanna say,
*  okay, this is really intriguing and interesting,
*  and I've invested a lot in this monkey model
*  and then doing all the CSF work in patients
*  to suggest that there may be a there there here,
*  but I wanna see it replicate.
*  We did have an article that Stanford Medicine,
*  I can send you the link, they were able to,
*  I think, interview a family that had been in the trial.
*  And so obviously there was patient privacy,
*  and they have to say, it's okay to talk about it,
*  but this is a family that was contacted,
*  I think they were anonymous, but this is in this report.
*  And they basically said, the dad said
*  that his son was walking around, he was on vasopressin,
*  and his son was walking around a grocery store,
*  and he was looking for him, and he turned around,
*  and he said he was gobsmacked because his child
*  was just talking to, making chit chat with somebody
*  like in an aisle, and he said he had never seen
*  that happen before.
*  And so we do have anecdotal reports like that,
*  and I think the tricky part is,
*  are we, we didn't stratify anyone going into this trial,
*  and so the concern always is,
*  did we get really lucky in the first trial,
*  and we somehow got the quote unquote right people
*  that entered the trial that were gonna be the ones
*  who would respond to the medication,
*  or is this a medication that has sort of broad use
*  in this population, and we, the second trial will be positive?
*  You used nasal spray to deliver the vasopressin,
*  and presumably that gets into the blood circulation
*  of the brain, and supplies neurons with vasopressin,
*  but it's very nonspecific, and I'm not criticizing it,
*  but if you think about it, you're just putting
*  a bunch of vasopressin into the brain,
*  and if people wonder why this is,
*  because basically you have neurons
*  of your central nervous system
*  are part of your olfactory system,
*  and believe it or not, right behind your,
*  where your nose meets your forehead,
*  the brain is right there.
*  There's a little bit of bone,
*  and then the brain is right there.
*  So one of the reasons you can get in there,
*  and it's easier than an ocular injection or something,
*  that wouldn't be a good approach,
*  and it's easier than peripheral injection into the vein,
*  but at the same time, I have to presume that this,
*  I'm imagining this vasopressin just kind of like
*  permeating through the brain,
*  binding to whatever receptors happen to be there.
*  You said the receptors are everywhere,
*  and then this significant improvement in social cognition.
*  So that raises all sorts of interesting questions
*  about what relevant circuits are impacted,
*  or is it some global,
*  could it be some global increase
*  in kind of awareness of surroundings,
*  although some autistic kids are overwhelmed
*  by their awareness of surroundings.
*  So yeah, what are some thoughts
*  about how vasopressin might be working
*  to exert this really impressive
*  and frankly important effect?
*  Right, so I mean, could it increase social motivation?
*  Does it, you know, like, so let's talk about
*  how sort of complexity of social sensory processing.
*  Is it that we're directing attention to social cues
*  where there wouldn't have necessarily
*  been as much attentiveness, right?
*  Are we increasing social motivation,
*  which would suggest from some of the animal studies
*  may actually be happening, right?
*  We don't know, and I think that's partly
*  when you have other models,
*  or if you're able, you know, to do imaging studies.
*  I mean, one thing that's been a little bit
*  of a holy grail in this field
*  is that if we could get tracers
*  that are basically like, you know,
*  a molecule that would allow us to inject it into somebody
*  and then visualize the brain,
*  like if I'm thinking about a pet tracer, a radio ligand,
*  where you could then ask questions about,
*  you know, what's happening in the brain?
*  Can we give vasopressin in the context
*  of a functional brain imaging scan
*  and ask like, where is the vasopressin binding?
*  What kind of circuits are involved?
*  Like that needs to be the next step of the work
*  to know like where our targets are.
*  And you can do something like functional proteomics, right?
*  Where if you know where vasopressin receptors are,
*  you can overlay that with studies
*  of functional brain imaging, right?
*  And that would allow you to say,
*  these areas are dense in vasopressin receptors,
*  and do we see similar responses
*  in what we call bold signal on a brain scan?
*  So let's be more colloquial about this.
*  Like do certain areas of the brain light up, if you will,
*  where we know vasopressin receptors are densely distributed
*  in ways that we know are tied to social motivation
*  or social salience or other things
*  that we think could be moving the needle here in the trial.
*  How is this happening?
*  And I think, you know, one thing,
*  the reason why we did this work is,
*  and I think it speaks to what you said earlier,
*  is there is an urgency on the part of parents
*  to say, you know, my child's brain is developing, right?
*  And there's a sense of that, you know,
*  the sort of Western model has failed a lot of people.
*  You know, they look to doctors and say,
*  what are the solutions?
*  And doctors will say, well, we have a limited number
*  of tools in the toolkit here.
*  We just don't know, right?
*  And so, you know, one of the reasons why they did
*  that big oxytocin study was that people were trying
*  to get the oxytocin anyway.
*  So it was like, let's just make sure that this is safe.
*  Let's see if it's effective.
*  And so some of our thinking was, you know,
*  as soon as some of this work hits, you know,
*  like it gets, and some of the work has been covered
*  by the media.
*  And so, you know, our feeling was,
*  we can give this intranasally,
*  and we can do it under safe monitoring ways.
*  And so people are gonna think about doing these things
*  anyway, so let's just make sure that this is safe
*  and let's test this in a rigorous way.
*  So we don't know the mode of action,
*  but then our feeling is that, you know,
*  at least from the initial safety data, it looks pretty safe.
*  And, you know, and so the idea would be,
*  and there's a long tradition in psychiatry
*  of we don't know the mechanism of action,
*  but if we have a medication that can be impactful
*  and improve the lives of people with autism,
*  and we can diminish suffering,
*  and people can more readily reach their full potential,
*  you know, to me, it actually seems unethical
*  not to move forward in a way that's scientifically sound.
*  Amen to that.
*  This seems like a good time to raise
*  the topic of the microbiome,
*  and not as an unrelated topic.
*  And here's why, I've seen a fair number of studies
*  in mouse models, arguing that in a mouse model of autism,
*  which now, frankly, I have to kind of wonder
*  about the power of that model,
*  but anyway, the models are out there in the field.
*  That fecal transplant into a host
*  that does have social deficits,
*  and rescue some degree of social deficits.
*  I don't know if this has actually been done in humans
*  as well, and for those of you that are cringing,
*  yes, they do fecal transplants in humans
*  for treatment of obesity and a bunch of other things.
*  This isn't because scientists are obsessed
*  with fecal matter, it's because fecal matter
*  contains a lot of the microbiome elements,
*  so the micro bacteria of the gut.
*  And the reason I'm raising this now is, you know,
*  one possibility, and it's not mutually exclusive
*  with a brain mechanism, is that the administration
*  of vasopressin somehow rescued a vasopressin deficiency
*  in the gut, so the questions are as follows.
*  Is there any evidence that vasopressin is manufactured in
*  or impacted by the gut microbiome of humans?
*  We'll just start with humans, since I think most,
*  and because that wouldn't be a smoking gun,
*  but it'd be an interesting detective story.
*  Well, okay, so the one piece of evidence that I will say
*  that I find provocative and fascinating,
*  and one thing I wanna say is, I think there's really great
*  work done in mice, I don't wanna be a mouse basher,
*  so I wanna just sort of go on the record
*  that I'm not bashing other models.
*  If it's a conserved, so I think about everything
*  from an evolutionary perspective, if a mouse shares
*  a brain structure with a human and it's highly conserved,
*  you know, mouse work can be incredibly important
*  and very impactful, right?
*  Yeah, my lab did years of mouse work,
*  some primate work where necessary,
*  now I only work on humans, but absolutely,
*  it has its uses, but clearly the primate model
*  for social deficits as it relates to autism,
*  you at least have me convinced that that one
*  has a lot of power, let's just say that.
*  Exactly, okay, but I mean, I now say there is a really cool
*  mouse study that was done that I found,
*  and there's been lots of different studies,
*  so there has been mice, so there's these, like I said,
*  these genetically modified mice that have genetic syndromes
*  that are, you know, where the individuals
*  have social impairments, and some of these individuals,
*  and again, here's a problem with a field,
*  often they will measure oxytocin,
*  but not vasopressin, right, so like,
*  they're not often both measured together,
*  which I always do now, but there's been some really
*  interesting evidence that in these mouse models,
*  and again, multiple studies, but like,
*  certainly low blood oxytocin levels in these mouse models,
*  and with the sense that maybe they have
*  some sort of abnormal gut microbiome,
*  and then what they've done is they've given a probiotic
*  to these mice, normalized their social functioning,
*  and that there's an increase in oxytocin,
*  and in a recent study, also vasopressin,
*  at the level of the hypothalamus.
*  So by giving a probiotic, you,
*  I believe the oxytocin levels were increased in the blood,
*  you saw more species typical social behavior,
*  and this was all driven by this upregulation
*  of oxytocin gene expression, and also vasopressin
*  in this very recent study, and what's interesting is,
*  there's this nerve called the vagus nerve,
*  which is, it's, I think, it means the wandering nerve.
*  It's for vagabond.
*  Yeah, exactly, right, and even, it's in the gut,
*  but it actually has a direct projection to the nuclei
*  in the hypothalamus where oxytocin and vasopressin are made.
*  How interesting. Yes, and so when you sever the vagus,
*  you then, in this one study, it's a neuron paper,
*  I think it's like 2020, it's a super cool paper,
*  and then what you do is you decrease the gene expression,
*  and you don't see the rescue of the oxytocin levels
*  or the social behavior in this model.
*  So in other words, if I interpret this correctly,
*  and I'll go look up the paper and provide a link to it,
*  by increasing the diversity of gut microbiota,
*  because that's really what a probiotic does,
*  sort of across the board increases the diversity
*  of gut microbiota, no one specific illus, as I always say,
*  because they all seem to end in illus, you know,
*  multiple illus, illus, illus, illus, here we go again.
*  You upregulate gene expression and thereby action
*  of oxytocin and vasopressin in the hypothalamus.
*  But that's a neural mediated thing,
*  it's not as if the microbiota travel to the brain,
*  something changes in the gut, which activates
*  the vagal pathway from gut to the specific nucleus
*  in the brain, and we know that the vagal pathway
*  is involved, because it seems at least partially necessary.
*  If you sever that, you give a vagotomy,
*  then this effect is blunted or eliminated.
*  That's very interesting and ties the microbiome
*  to oxytocin vasopressin production in a neural
*  and somewhat causal way, and makes the data
*  on fecal transplants make a lot of more sense.
*  Because I always wondered, okay, so you take a,
*  you know, taking the microbiota from one animal,
*  put them into another animal, you're creating,
*  transferring the milieu of the gut.
*  But it doesn't say anything about mechanism.
*  So this is a really cool paper.
*  It's fascinating, and there's also a study
*  I've always wanted to do, is you can get
*  a vagal nerve stimulator, they used to do them
*  as implants, right, but you can also get one
*  that you sort of clip onto the ear.
*  And I've always wanted to ask if we use this
*  in autistic individuals, could we increase,
*  like can we alter social behavior, right?
*  And would that be something that we could actually measure
*  in the blood, especially if we're seeing this change
*  in these blood levels, right?
*  Are you doing that experiment?
*  No, but I've always, I've always said it would be so cool.
*  We have to get you the funding to do that experiment.
*  And I know a few times you've raised the issue of funding.
*  It's not something we spend a lot of time on this,
*  discussing on this podcast, but I think what should be
*  abundantly clear to the listeners throughout the course
*  of this episode is, as you mentioned earlier,
*  you're very determined to get work done.
*  You'll figure out a way, but the way I describe
*  finances and research is that it's absolutely necessary,
*  but it's not sufficient.
*  You of course have to have the right people
*  and the right lab head directing the work,
*  but no money, no project.
*  And it is disappointing to see that despite
*  the federal budget for research being, you know,
*  still reasonable, it's not what we would like it to be.
*  It's still very hard for amazing world-class labs
*  like yours to say, hey, you know, listen,
*  there's this vagal thing, and clearly
*  there's a rationale.
*  It's not like you're pulling this out of nowhere.
*  And you want to go to this study,
*  but what we're really talking about is three to five years
*  of grant writing before you could even initiate that study.
*  Meanwhile, autistic kids are going from age two to five
*  to six, these are critical windows.
*  So if ever there was a rationale for moving a lot of funding
*  to, you know, I don't even call it high risk,
*  but you know, logically sound hypothesis testing
*  for the treatment of autism, it's now.
*  So I'm going to get active on this front.
*  So I won't get into how, but you know,
*  when I get something in my neural circuits for talking,
*  they tend to not shut down for a while.
*  Well, there will be a community that is going
*  to be immensely grateful.
*  Well, it seems like the parents of these kids
*  and the kids themselves could greatly benefit.
*  So you mentioned that the first study
*  on vasopressin administration that saw these improvements
*  in social functioning, you said a small cohort,
*  how many kids was it ultimately that you could use data from?
*  Okay, so we had, I mean, you screen a lot.
*  So I think our, you know,
*  because we had very rigid criteria.
*  So we ended up with 17 kids that were on active drug
*  and 13 that were on placebo.
*  And then- So not a tiny study.
*  No, and the placebo, we always have like a humanitarian
*  open label extension arm, which allows for anybody
*  who is in placebo can get access to the drug.
*  So both Antonio and I feel very strongly about making sure
*  that if we're doing a medication trial,
*  everybody can benefit from it, right?
*  So- Afterwards, if they say,
*  okay, I was in the placebo group,
*  but I really want the chance to try this thing.
*  Yes. They can, but then you also get more data.
*  We get, right.
*  So I think when the families are now aware
*  that their child is on vasopressin
*  and the clinicians are aware, you know, you really want,
*  there's a huge placebo response rate, right?
*  And so, I mean, it's not a placebo response rate here,
*  but we really would want to make sure that our evaluation
*  of the social behavior is done unaware to the medication,
*  but you can get good safety data, right?
*  So you can have those, you know,
*  13 children who were on placebo.
*  We can then also make sure that their blood chemistry labs
*  look good, that their electrocardiograms look good, right?
*  And so that also allows us to assess safety parameters
*  in a greater number of children.
*  In a fairly broad literature search,
*  I was able to find, okay, microbiome,
*  so fecal transplant is something
*  that people are excited about, as weird as that.
*  And there are trials in people with autism ongoing.
*  In fecal, using fecal transplants.
*  Okay.
*  Oxytocin, nasal spray,
*  presumably still being investigated by some groups,
*  or it's been abandoned?
*  Well, I think it's mostly been abandoned
*  because there's no funding priorities for it, right?
*  So I know that maybe in Australia,
*  because of Adam's positive findings,
*  that I don't know what his plans are,
*  but maybe he's doing work there,
*  there might be a little bit of work
*  with behavioral therapy and oxytocin,
*  but this is the problem.
*  When there's one big trial that fails,
*  the funding just completely dries up.
*  So even if there's promise,
*  I don't know a single funding agency that's gonna touch it.
*  Got it.
*  And then there's the Vesa-Preson administration work
*  that you're doing. Right.
*  I think it's worth contrasting that work
*  with the fairly large trial
*  that was done by a major pharmaceutical company
*  exploring the role of Vesa-Preson
*  for the treatment of autism.
*  You could tell us what they did
*  because it's basically the opposite of what you did.
*  Right.
*  And you can tell us the outcome
*  because I think that if anything,
*  that study inadvertently provides support
*  for the results that you observed,
*  which is that administering,
*  let's say increasing Vesa-Preson levels in the brain
*  seems to ameliorate some of the social deficits of autism.
*  Right.
*  So Roche had a compound called Balavaptin,
*  which was a Vesa-Preson V1A receptor antagonist,
*  which basically means there's,
*  I think I mentioned there's these four neuropeptide
*  receptors and oxytocin, Vesa-Preson
*  bind to each other's receptors,
*  but the V1A receptor is the one that is
*  most implicated in social behavior.
*  And so they had, and this is the tricky part
*  about when medications are developed
*  in pharma versus in academics, right?
*  In academics, there's definitely this transparency.
*  We write grants, the abstracts are publicly available,
*  we register our trials, they do too,
*  but a lot of the, shall we say early development
*  is all put out in publications, right?
*  And then it's also peer reviewed
*  and there's an open trail of why we're doing
*  what we're doing, but in a pharmaceutical company,
*  they have the ability, because also they have
*  all the funding, to be able to do all kinds of development
*  that may never see the light of day
*  because of the proprietary basis of it, right?
*  And so when you go back to, so it's not,
*  it still is not clear to me why they took
*  the approach of using an antagonist
*  to the main Vesa-Preson receptor in the brain.
*  What's interesting is if you go back
*  and you look at the animal literature,
*  there are hamsters that if you give them Vesa-Preson,
*  they become aggressive, right?
*  And if you give male Prairie Vols Vesa-Preson,
*  they can become aggressive.
*  But let's think about the context
*  that they're doing this in.
*  These hamsters that show aggression are asocial,
*  they live by themselves.
*  If you give them Vesa-Preson
*  and the only social repertoire they have
*  is to have sex with a female or to fight a male
*  that they see, they have a very limited social repertoire.
*  And when the Prairie Vol male is being given Vesa-Preson,
*  it's often in the context of protecting his mate
*  and his offspring.
*  And so then it's actually species appropriate
*  for him to attack a maraudering male on his territory
*  who's going to kill his babies.
*  And so my thinking in reading the preclinical literature,
*  the animal literature, was that, all right,
*  that makes a lot of sense in the context of those species,
*  but we've never seen any evidence in our trial,
*  aggression didn't change.
*  We also have an aggression measure
*  in the current trial as well.
*  But for me, the vast majority of evidence
*  from the animal literature suggested
*  that Vesa-Preson was pro-social,
*  and that especially given our CSF findings,
*  like over and over across species,
*  across studies, across ages,
*  that we should be giving Vesa-Preson,
*  especially given the correlations between Vesa-Preson
*  in CSF and symptom severity and autistic traits,
*  you know, the former in people
*  and the latter in the monkeys.
*  And so they had some preliminary studies
*  that I believe were maybe single dose,
*  one that they published,
*  but then they had a trial where the primary outcome measure,
*  the social responsiveness scale was negative,
*  and then they had some secondary measures
*  that maybe showed some promise.
*  And then they were conducting another trial,
*  and then they did a futility analysis,
*  and I know they stopped the trial,
*  and I don't think it was for safety reasons,
*  but again, you know, a lot of this isn't made public, right,
*  because it's a pharmaceutical company.
*  So, you know, we will see,
*  because we are going to be completing our larger trial,
*  you know, this year,
*  and you know, as they say, the proof is in the pudding,
*  so we will see if, you know,
*  we can replicate our initial pilot findings.
*  Well, it sounds like they got it backwards,
*  that blocking vasopressin pathways
*  would just make things worse,
*  and that augmenting vasopressin makes things better,
*  although that last statement needs to be supported
*  by this more extensive population.
*  Right, well, I think, you know,
*  there's been a lot of speculation,
*  and maybe there are people closer to the trial than me
*  who might be able to speak to mechanism,
*  but, you know, I would meet the Roche people at conferences,
*  and they would come to my talks,
*  and I would always ask them, like,
*  what's the mechanism of action?
*  Why are you antagonizing the system
*  when we're giving, you know,
*  a vasopressin agonist, if you will?
*  And, you know, some people had said,
*  well, maybe by blocking the vasopressin receptor,
*  you know, there's a way to have oxytocin
*  be more bioavailable.
*  It sounds like some gymnastics.
*  Yeah, yeah, I totally agree.
*  And so I've never had a,
*  I've never received a compelling response from anybody
*  about why they did their trial,
*  and then, you know, the differences.
*  I mean, when this was ongoing,
*  and, you know, there was potentially room for both, right?
*  You know, maybe I thought that maybe there's
*  some optimal band of vasopressin signaling in the brain,
*  right, and so maybe there's some people
*  where they have too much vasopressin
*  and some who have too little, right?
*  And so this was a lot of maybes,
*  but it doesn't, to me, seem like that's the case,
*  especially if our current trial has a positive readout.
*  I'd be remiss if I didn't ask for your stance
*  and read of the landscape on the data
*  about vaccines and autism.
*  I'm not talking about COVID vaccines here.
*  I wanna be really clear about that,
*  but there was a theory running about,
*  not just in the press, but in the scientific literature
*  for a while, that vaccines could cause autism.
*  That was proposed.
*  My understanding is that was debunked.
*  That idea still lives on the internet,
*  but what is the evidence?
*  Let's say, let's go through this sequentially.
*  What was the idea?
*  What was the evidence for that idea?
*  And then what caused the demise of the,
*  at least the scientific support for that idea?
*  Leaving open, of course, that new data may come,
*  but let's talk about what is known now.
*  And I think what I will say is being evidence-based
*  is sort of like something that all scientists
*  should strive for, right?
*  And so the backstory on this is there was a guy
*  named Andrew Wakefield who published a paper
*  and he basically said the preservatives in vaccines
*  are causing autism.
*  So not the specific vaccine, but the adjuvant,
*  the stuff that's preserving,
*  the stuff that's keeping the vaccines bio-effective.
*  Right, at least that was my understanding.
*  Yeah, that's mine as well.
*  And so, and then it-
*  I wanna be clear, cause the internet is a cruel
*  and diabolical place.
*  My stance is that that was the hypothesis.
*  I don't agree with that stance.
*  Right, right.
*  And so, or if we wanna just back up a little bit broader,
*  there was this idea that something about vaccines
*  were causing autism, but the study was debunked.
*  He lost his medical license
*  and the paper was retracted, right?
*  He lost his medical license on the basis
*  of the fact that the study was wrong or was there-
*  I think he faked the data.
*  That's what I recall as well,
*  that there was evidence of him
*  literally making up the data.
*  Right. Right.
*  So it wasn't a case of sloppy technique,
*  it was a case of intentional fraud.
*  Right, that's my understanding.
*  What was the-
*  Does anyone ever look into what his motivation
*  for what it was?
*  Like why someone would-
*  I mean, he threw away his whole career.
*  Right, yeah, I don't know.
*  But I think the hard part about that is understandably,
*  people got very frightened, right?
*  That we're doing something to our children
*  that could have unanticipated consequences.
*  And when something like that happens,
*  then we dump, we spend a lot of money investigating it.
*  And so the good news is at this point,
*  there have been multiple, multiple studies
*  that haven't shown a correlation between vaccines and autism.
*  I do believe the preservatives have been changed
*  as a result, so that's something we should check.
*  That might be something where there's been
*  a public health change on preservatives that are in vaccines.
*  That's interesting in its own right.
*  I mean, we don't wanna cause alarm,
*  but that's interesting that in this data fraud case,
*  it might've cued people to the idea
*  that certain things might've been needing change,
*  even though it wasn't the specific issue
*  that this fraudulent researcher was focused on.
*  The change was made to make sure people
*  would vaccinate their children, right?
*  So this is something that I think we should have
*  lots of caveats here, like post the studies,
*  make sure that what we're saying is accurate, right?
*  But I think that my concern is that we've spent,
*  so the good news is that every single study
*  that I'm aware of does not show a relationship
*  between vaccination and autism, right?
*  And so I think that most scientists and medical doctors
*  that I know that are part of the standard
*  biomedical research community
*  do not believe that vaccines cause autism.
*  They vaccinate their own children,
*  they recommend vaccinations to other people's children.
*  And so I think that's where we are.
*  Could I just ask a question?
*  And I feel more than obligated to do this
*  because I think I have a pretty good finger
*  on the pulse of the listenership of this podcast,
*  but I think there's a range of stances on this
*  where some people have a lot of trust
*  in the standard medical establishment,
*  others have less trust in the standard medical establishment
*  and I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't try
*  and represent all those sides.
*  And one thing that I've heard is that over the last 20
*  or 30 years, there's been a dramatic increase
*  in the number of vaccinations that kids get.
*  And I don't know if that's true,
*  but when we say vaccinations,
*  we could be talking about measles, mumps, rubella, polio.
*  We could also be talking about measles, mumps, rubella,
*  polio, flu shots every year, rabies vaccine, tetanus vaccine.
*  HPV.
*  HPV, right, with one that wasn't even available
*  when I was in college, as everyone in college
*  was well aware there wasn't an HPV vaccine.
*  Didn't change people's behavior a whole lot,
*  but you know,
*  there's a vaccine, there's multiple vaccines,
*  and then there's all the vaccines, right?
*  And I think that one of the concerns that I hear about
*  is the idea that, okay, there's some critical vaccines,
*  but then which ones are perhaps less critical, if any.
*  And these are the kinds of discussions
*  that are starting to surface
*  and that have parents and potential parents
*  rightfully thinking about this stuff.
*  And no one really knows where to get the information.
*  But like, I've tried, and I can't find a pediatrician
*  that says, hey, listen, these, but not those.
*  Or you can certainly find board certified physicians
*  that say many and certain board certified physicians
*  that say none, you actually can find those.
*  The none category tend to hide themselves
*  a little bit more than others for obvious reasons,
*  but it's hard to get a sense of like,
*  which vaccines are critical and which ones aren't
*  if you're a parent and you're not versed in this stuff.
*  And so you could imagine that like,
*  you know, kids are taking many more vaccines
*  and only some of those are critical
*  and maybe all of them are critical.
*  Well, I think, I guess the way I would maybe turn it
*  on its head is that, you know, because of this study
*  that did in some ways so much harm, right?
*  Like we spent- The way field study.
*  We spent, I don't even wanna hazard a guess
*  about how much money worldwide went into studying,
*  you know, the vaccines and autism
*  based on a fraudulent data, right?
*  Like that's to me a real tragedy.
*  But at the time they didn't know it was fraudulent.
*  No, right, exactly.
*  So they went after this thinking it was true.
*  Okay.
*  But I think the thing, the consequence of all this
*  that I think is also extremely sad is that everybody,
*  because everyone got so riled up and so fearful,
*  there has been historically until recently,
*  many researchers who are like, oh man,
*  I don't wanna touch immunology and autism
*  with a 10 foot pole, right?
*  And yeah.
*  You know, and I wouldn't consider myself fearless,
*  but like my lab never had any reason to work on those,
*  on those important problems.
*  But I'll tell you, like, that seems like it,
*  it's not a kettle of fish, it's a ball of barbed wire
*  with a bunch of, you know, napalm burning around it.
*  Totally.
*  I mean, you say one thing, your career is ending.
*  You say the opposite thing, your career is also ending.
*  You know, it's a mess.
*  But I think this highlights that there are so many parents,
*  you know, again, and I think we need to listen
*  to parent stakeholders, right?
*  Like, you know, there needs to be a dialogue
*  whenever anybody's studying any illness
*  to talk to the people who are involved, right?
*  And I think that there are parents who will report,
*  wow, like there is immune system dysregulation in my child.
*  And, but because of this historical issue with vaccines,
*  it's only been very recently that I think people,
*  scientists, medical doctors have said,
*  okay, we're hearing a lot about this from parents.
*  And are there a group of individuals who have, you know,
*  immune issues that could be driving their autism, right?
*  We don't know and everything should be evidence-based.
*  But I think that, like you said,
*  with this cancel culture and all this fear,
*  scientists sometimes will pick topics very judiciously
*  based on, you know, like, hey, I just wanna be left in peace
*  and I'm trying to help this community.
*  And if there is areas of the enterprise
*  that you think are gonna cause all kinds of grief,
*  then people are gonna be less reluctant to study them,
*  even if it's critically needed.
*  Well, that's a perfect place to say thank you.
*  I realize you're not addressing
*  the vaccine autism issue directly,
*  but you're so clearly going after the target,
*  trying to figure out what are the biological mechanisms
*  that are disrupted in autism
*  and by extension other deficits of social function
*  in kids and adults.
*  You've identified this incredible relationship
*  between vasopressin,
*  which should have more prominence, in my opinion,
*  than oxytocin, its lesser cousin.
*  Just kidding, oxytocin lovers.
*  But also have shown, you know, yes, in a small study,
*  but you're now extending this to a larger cohort,
*  as you mentioned, a causal relationship.
*  When vasopressin is administered
*  to these low vasopressin slash low social functioning kids,
*  their symptoms improve.
*  So I know I speak for many people when I say that
*  I truly appreciate your doggedness
*  in going after this problem,
*  especially on the complicated landscape
*  of lack of funding for doing novel
*  and truly high-risk work.
*  Especially on the backdrop of the
*  socio-political landscape around autism,
*  it's a complicated thing even to discuss.
*  As I mentioned in the introduction,
*  we had to have some fluency around autism,
*  so we sometimes said autistic.
*  Sometimes we said people with autism.
*  I mean, it's a tough one,
*  but in order to make progress, real progress in this area,
*  we need people like you, we need you,
*  and you're doing it, to get in there and just go,
*  okay, let's get at the biological functions,
*  let's get at the novel treatments,
*  and you're making amazing progress.
*  So I'm so grateful that you're doing it
*  and that you'll continue to do it
*  and that you came here today
*  to teach us what you've been up to.
*  I'm oh so grateful and I just wanna say thank you for that
