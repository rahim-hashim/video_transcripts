# AMA #19: Collagen vs. Whey Protein, Creatine, Smelling Salts, Stimulants & More
**Andrew Huberman:** [April 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs)
*  Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=0.0s)]
*  where we discuss science [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=2.32s)]
*  and science-based tools for everyday life. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  I'm Andrew Huberman, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=9.48s)]
*  and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=10.68s)]
*  at Stanford School of Medicine. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=13.76s)]
*  I'm also wearing my Roka Red Lens glasses, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=15.96s)]
*  which block both blue light and green light, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=18.3s)]
*  both of which are so-called short wavelength light. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=21.16s)]
*  That's because we are recording this AMA at night, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  and the lights in here are very bright, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=27.46s)]
*  and bright lights at night will quash your melatonin, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=29.32s)]
*  which is the hormone of sleepiness. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=33.24s)]
*  Bright lights at night also increase cortisol levels, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=34.84s)]
*  and by blocking those short wavelengths of light, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=37.88s)]
*  you offset the reductions in melatonin [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=39.76s)]
*  and the increases in cortisol that would otherwise occur. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=41.92s)]
*  And I always make the general recommendation [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=45.28s)]
*  that whether or not you decide to wear blue-green blockers [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=47.6s)]
*  or blue blockers or simply no blockers [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  that you dim your lights at night, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=52.8s)]
*  it will greatly facilitate your transition to sleep [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=54.32s)]
*  and the quality of your sleep. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=56.68s)]
*  So this AMA is part of our premium subscriber channel. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=58.44s)]
*  Our premium subscriber channel was started [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=61.72s)]
*  in order to provide support [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=64.14s)]
*  for the standard Huberman Lab podcast, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=65.48s)]
*  which of course comes out every Monday. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=67.48s)]
*  Those are our full-length episodes. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=69.64s)]
*  We also now have Huberman Lab Essentials episodes, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=70.88s)]
*  which are 30-minute Essentials only episodes, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=73.24s)]
*  so just the actionable protocols [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=75.92s)]
*  and the key mechanisms behind those protocols, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=78.0s)]
*  those come out every Thursday. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=80.52s)]
*  Both the full-length episodes and Essentials episodes [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=82.96s)]
*  are available at zero cost to everybody [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=85.36s)]
*  on all standard platforms, so YouTube, Apple, Spotify. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=87.96s)]
*  We now have the full-length episodes on X as well. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=91.32s)]
*  We started the premium channel [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=93.8s)]
*  as a way to generate support for exciting research [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=95.1s)]
*  being done at Stanford School of Medicine, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=97.63999999999999s)]
*  on the main campus at Stanford and elsewhere. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=99.41999999999999s)]
*  The research that we fund is largely applied research. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=102.24s)]
*  We do fund some basic research, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  but it's largely applied research, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=107.22s)]
*  meaning it's research that's geared [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=108.88s)]
*  toward developing novel therapeutics [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=110.63999999999999s)]
*  for mental health, physical health, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=112.8s)]
*  and performance in humans as soon as possible. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=114.39999999999999s)]
*  We've already done several rounds of research funding, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=117.46s)]
*  and I'm excited to tell you about the results [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=120.11999999999999s)]
*  of those studies as they become available. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=121.96s)]
*  I'm also pleased to inform you that for every dollar [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=124.3s)]
*  that the Huberman Lab Premium Channel generates [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=126.5s)]
*  for research studies, there are now three matching donors [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=128.42s)]
*  that match that amount. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=131.9s)]
*  The tiny foundation, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=133.38s)]
*  along with two other generous anonymous donors, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=134.5s)]
*  have agreed to do a dollar-for-dollar match. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=137.0s)]
*  So technically, given the number of dollar-for-dollar matches, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=139.22s)]
*  it's now a dollar-for-dollar-for-dollar-for-dollar match, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=142.45999999999998s)]
*  that is for every dollar provided [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=144.94s)]
*  by the Premium Channel for research, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=146.72s)]
*  we have $3 provided to the Premium Channel's research fund, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=148.32s)]
*  and then we distribute that to various investigators, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=152.58s)]
*  as I mentioned, at Stanford and other universities [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=155.54s)]
*  throughout the United States. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=157.82s)]
*  This is a 4X amplification of the total amount of funding [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=159.38s)]
*  given to studies of mental health, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=162.0s)]
*  physical health, and performance. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=163.56s)]
*  And of course, as those studies are completed and published, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=165.36s)]
*  we will be sure to share the data [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=168.0s)]
*  and the actionable tools [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=170.04s)]
*  that emerge from those data with you. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=171.72s)]
*  So for those of you [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=173.84s)]
*  who are already Premium Channel members, thank you. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=174.68s)]
*  And for those of you that are considering [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=177.12s)]

*  is right for you. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=223.98s)]
*  And now without further ado, I will answer your questions. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=225.12s)]
*  The first question for today's AMA is, quote, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=228.26s)]
*  is there a distinct health advantage to using bone broth [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=231.73999999999998s)]
*  or collagen protein versus whey protein? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=234.42s)]
*  I get this question pretty often, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=237.89999999999998s)]
*  and I touched on this in the episode [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=239.94s)]
*  that I did with Dr. Lane Norton, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=241.5s)]
*  but I think the key thing to remember here is that [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=243.6s)]
*  while protein is one of the three macronutrients, right? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=247.82s)]
*  Proteins, carbohydrates, and fats, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=250.35999999999999s)]
*  not all proteins are created equal. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=252.44s)]
*  Now, what differentiates different protein sources [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=255.06s)]
*  has a lot to do with how easily those proteins [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=259.22s)]
*  are assimilated into our body and their amino acid content. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=262.18s)]
*  Now, in general, how bioavailable a protein is, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=268.14000000000004s)]
*  as well as its quality or protein score, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=272.22s)]
*  relates to a number of things, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=275.90000000000003s)]
*  not the least of which is the amount of leucine, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=277.42s)]
*  which is a particular essential amino acid [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=280.38000000000005s)]
*  that we need to get from food. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=282.34000000000003s)]
*  So why is leucine important? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=283.8s)]
*  Well, leucine is an essential amino acid. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=285.14000000000004s)]
*  You need to get it from food. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=287.5s)]
*  And some protein sources, such as whey protein, for instance, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=289.26s)]
*  but also beef, chicken, eggs, et cetera, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=293.5s)]
*  have high levels of leucine [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=297.02s)]
*  as compared to other types of protein, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=299.22s)]
*  for instance, collagen protein, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=301.94s)]
*  and some not all bone broths. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=304.5s)]
*  And I'll explain what I mean by that in a moment. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=306.98s)]
*  So if we just step back from this question [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=309.1s)]
*  and ask it in two parts, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=310.74s)]
*  remember, the question was, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=312.54s)]
*  is there a distinct health advantage [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=313.58s)]
*  to using bone broth or collagen protein versus whey protein? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=315.34s)]
*  One can be very confident in the answer to that, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=319.94s)]
*  which is whey protein contains relatively high amounts [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=322.06s)]
*  of the amino acid leucine, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=325.06s)]
*  and therefore is going to be the superior form of protein [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=326.7s)]
*  if your goal is to grow muscle [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=329.62s)]
*  and or get stronger to repair muscle, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=331.5s)]
*  either muscle damage caused by exercise, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=333.53999999999996s)]
*  or simply to engage protein synthesis. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=335.9s)]
*  Remember, even if you haven't been exercising intensely [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=339.05999999999995s)]
*  or doing any resistance training, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=341.82s)]
*  and by the way, you should be doing resistance training [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=343.21999999999997s)]
*  and cardiovascular training, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=345.04s)]
*  but independent of exercise, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=346.8s)]
*  dietary protein, in particular dietary proteins [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=348.76000000000005s)]
*  that contain high amounts of leucine, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=351.24s)]
*  or I should say relatively high amounts of leucine, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=353.0s)]
*  like whey protein, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=355.16s)]
*  will help induce so-called muscle protein synthesis, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=356.84000000000003s)]
*  which is generally good for us, again, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=360.40000000000003s)]
*  and it's occurring, even if we're not exercising, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=364.20000000000005s)]
*  if we are exercising, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=366.8s)]
*  especially if we're exercising very hard, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=368.12s)]
*  and in particular, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=370.98s)]
*  if we're doing a lot of resistance training, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=371.82000000000005s)]
*  or frankly, any amount of resistance training [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=373.46s)]
*  that's taken near or to failure, right? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=375.58s)]
*  So it doesn't even have to be heavy weight, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=378.53999999999996s)]
*  but if you're stressing the muscles hard, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=380.21999999999997s)]
*  then having a quality protein source that's bioavailable, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=382.15999999999997s)]
*  that is you can assimilate it, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=385.78s)]
*  and that has relatively high leucine content [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=387.65999999999997s)]
*  is going to be advantageous. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=389.7s)]
*  So through that lens, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=391.59999999999997s)]
*  I can confidently answer the question [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=393.2s)]
*  by saying that a quality whey protein [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=395.38s)]
*  would be a better choice for a protein [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=398.2s)]
*  as compared to bone broth or a collagen protein, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=400.82s)]
*  which have relatively low amounts of leucine, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=403.56s)]
*  and if you look at their essential amino acid profile, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=406.58s)]
*  just sort of across the board, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=409.46s)]
*  not just focusing on leucine, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=410.46s)]
*  and compare that to whey protein, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=412.59999999999997s)]
*  we would easily say that whey protein [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=414.82s)]
*  is the superior form of protein, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=416.78s)]
*  again, both based on its bioavailability [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=418.74s)]
*  and its amino acid composition. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=421.86s)]
*  Now, does that mean that bone broth and collagen protein [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=424.46s)]
*  are not valuable at all? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=427.18s)]
*  No, I didn't say that, okay? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=428.82s)]
*  So when are bone broth and collagen proteins valuable? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=431.26s)]
*  So this has also come up [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=434.46s)]
*  in several Huberman Lab podcast episodes, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=435.5s)]
*  namely the episode that I did with Dr. Layne Norton, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=437.59999999999997s)]
*  also the episode that I did about skin health, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=440.64s)]
*  because there are some data, not a ton, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=443.78s)]
*  but there are some data showing [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=446.53999999999996s)]
*  that people who regularly ingest collagen protein [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=448.38s)]
*  can observe some improvements [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=451.78s)]
*  in skin elasticity and appearance. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=453.56s)]
*  Now, are these dramatic effects? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=456.6s)]
*  Not so much, but are these significant effects? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=458.64s)]
*  That is, are they statistically significant [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=461.41999999999996s)]
*  as compared to a control condition [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=464.0s)]
*  of either no collagen protein [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=466.28s)]
*  or a different protein source? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=467.91999999999996s)]
*  And there, one can find manuscripts [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=469.47999999999996s)]
*  that show, yes, indeed, ingesting collagen protein, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=471.8s)]
*  and by the way, bone broth has high amounts of collagen. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=475.58s)]
*  So we're treating bone broth and collagen protein [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=479.52s)]
*  sort of in combination here, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=481.71999999999997s)]
*  or we are considering them in combination. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=484.26s)]
*  And one would say that the amino acids [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=487.12s)]
*  that are contained in bone broth and collagen protein [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=489.6s)]
*  actually have been shown [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=493.3s)]
*  to support skin elasticity and appearance [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=494.74s)]
*  when ingested at levels of 15 grams per day [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=497.36s)]
*  over a period of about two weeks or more. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=500.44s)]
*  Okay, so through the lens of which protein source [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=503.14s)]
*  might be best for improving skin health and appearance, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=506.32s)]
*  the answer in this case would be [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=509.8s)]
*  that the bone broth and collagen protein [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=511.52s)]
*  is going to be superior to whey protein. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=513.6800000000001s)]
*  However, keep in mind that bone broth and collagen protein [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=515.76s)]
*  contain calories, right? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=520.04s)]
*  They contain protein and calories. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=521.48s)]
*  Sometimes they contain calories also from fat, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=522.7s)]
*  rarely from carbohydrate, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=525.04s)]
*  but you need to check the packaging [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=526.3199999999999s)]
*  and see what else is in there. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=527.52s)]
*  So that raises the question, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=530.46s)]
*  should you be taking bone broth slash collagen protein? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=532.36s)]
*  I would say either or, maybe both, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=535.92s)]
*  but either or and whey protein, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=537.88s)]
*  or rather, let's ask the question more scientifically, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=540.3199999999999s)]
*  will taking whey protein support skin health and appearance [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=543.7s)]
*  in a way that either mimics or can replace [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=548.1400000000001s)]
*  the positive effects that one gets [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=551.12s)]
*  from bone broth and collagen protein? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=552.5400000000001s)]
*  And the answer there would be no, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=554.34s)]
*  at least not in any direct way. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=556.38s)]
*  There's no evidence, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=558.1s)]
*  or at least there are no studies that I'm aware of, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=559.1400000000001s)]
*  of people taking whey protein [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=561.82s)]
*  as a way to improve skin health and appearance. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=563.4200000000001s)]
*  Now, that said, recovering from exercise, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=565.34s)]
*  inducing muscle protein synthesis, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=568.1800000000001s)]
*  these are things that are generally good for your body. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=570.0200000000001s)]
*  So they are going to support overall health, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=572.62s)]
*  immune health, your general sense of vigor. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=575.0600000000001s)]
*  There's all sorts of downstream things that happen [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=578.7s)]
*  when you stress your muscles and then recover them, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=580.7s)]
*  or even if you just eat a protein like whey protein, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=582.62s)]
*  and keep in mind, there are other proteins [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=585.9s)]
*  that have high leucine content that lend themselves [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=587.38s)]
*  as whey protein does to muscle protein synthesis. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=589.4s)]
*  So that's going to create an overall milieu, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=592.54s)]
*  an environment of health. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=594.52s)]
*  It certainly isn't the only path to health, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=596.74s)]
*  but it's going to create a general milieu of health [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=598.46s)]
*  in the right context, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=600.78s)]
*  provided you're ingesting it at the right amounts [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=602.04s)]
*  and in the right times. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=604.1s)]
*  And by the way, when I say that, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=604.9399999999999s)]
*  I know people are thinking, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=606.38s)]
*  well, how much is the right amount? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=607.22s)]
*  I am of the belief that most people [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=608.66s)]
*  who are seeking muscle protein synthesis, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=610.5799999999999s)]
*  recovery from exercise, and general health [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=613.12s)]
*  would do well to ingest approximately, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=616.14s)]
*  I'm not super neurotic about these things, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=619.02s)]
*  approximately one gram of quality protein [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=621.18s)]
*  per pound of lean body weight or desired body weight, okay? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=624.22s)]
*  Or if you want to be a little looser about it, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=629.1s)]
*  some people will just say one gram of quality protein [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=631.5s)]
*  per pound of body weight each day, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=634.1s)]
*  because that's going to vary from person to person. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=636.38s)]
*  So how much whey protein? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=639.0600000000001s)]
*  Well, it depends on how much other protein you're ingesting. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=640.62s)]
*  So let's simplify things here. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=643.7s)]
*  If in trying to get that one gram of protein [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=645.14s)]
*  per pound of body weight or so, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=647.86s)]
*  you have a limited budget, as most people do, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=650.38s)]
*  I would personally suggest that you get a significant portion [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=653.4200000000001s)]
*  of whatever that protein requirement is. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=656.84s)]
*  Maybe it's 150 grams, maybe it's 200 grams, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=659.1600000000001s)]
*  maybe it's a hundred grams, depending on your size. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=661.52s)]
*  I would suggest getting 60 to 70% of that [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=665.9200000000001s)]
*  from whole food sources. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=669.52s)]
*  So it could be quality lean meats, chicken, eggs, fish. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=671.08s)]
*  If you're a vegetarian, yes, there are combinations [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=675.24s)]
*  of things like beans and rice [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=678.4s)]
*  that will allow you to achieve the proper combinations [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=680.88s)]
*  of essential amino acids. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=685.18s)]
*  There are some sources of non-animal proteins [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=686.9399999999999s)]
*  that will meet all those amino acid needs. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=689.66s)]
*  You can look these up, they're easy to find online now. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=691.8s)]
*  There's also casein protein, milk protein. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=694.3s)]
*  I would suggest getting most of your protein [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=697.56s)]
*  for muscle protein synthesis [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=699.78s)]
*  and for recovery from exercise from whole food sources. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=701.54s)]
*  And then the remaining 30% or so, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=707.02s)]
*  I suppose this could be as high as 50% [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=709.8199999999999s)]
*  if you're having trouble eating enough during the day, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=711.5799999999999s)]
*  could come from a protein powder, so to speak, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=714.34s)]
*  or a protein bar. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=716.7800000000001s)]
*  And whey protein is an excellent source of protein [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=717.96s)]
*  in that instance. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=721.26s)]
*  And those whey proteins are available out there [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=722.5400000000001s)]
*  with minimal amounts or zero amounts of carbohydrate in them. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=724.4200000000001s)]
*  Some of them have sweeteners like stevia, some don't. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=727.22s)]
*  They vary in cost a bit, they vary in flavor a bit, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=731.0s)]
*  in mixability a bit. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=734.38s)]
*  So you have to find what works for you. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=735.58s)]
*  These are now pretty easy to find out there. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=737.1800000000001s)]
*  You just have to pick the one that's right for you [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=739.14s)]
*  and for your budget. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=740.6600000000001s)]
*  That's to meet your one gram of protein per pound [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=742.04s)]
*  of body weight sort of threshold. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=744.56s)]
*  And again, you don't have to be super neurotic [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=746.9599999999999s)]
*  about reaching that threshold every single day. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=749.1999999999999s)]
*  I'm about 100 kilograms or about 220 pounds. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=751.88s)]
*  Probably a little bit lighter now, maybe 210 pounds. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=754.8s)]
*  I probably get anywhere from 175 to 210 grams [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=757.3199999999999s)]
*  of protein per day. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=761.76s)]
*  I know that from having tracked it recently, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=762.8399999999999s)]
*  but I'm not neurotic about making sure that every day [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=765.0799999999999s)]
*  I get 210 grams or 200 grams. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=767.6999999999999s)]
*  I'll let it vary a little bit. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=770.04s)]
*  And sometimes it gets a bit lower [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=771.56s)]
*  and sometimes it gets a little bit higher. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=772.8s)]
*  At least that works for me. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=774.9599999999999s)]
*  I'm also not in a mode of life where I'm trying to put on [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=777.04s)]
*  a lot of muscle or something like that. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=780.06s)]
*  So if you are, maybe you need to pay a bit more attention [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=781.66s)]
*  to the details. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=783.78s)]
*  But so that's to get your protein ration per day. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=784.6199999999999s)]
*  And of course you also need to make sure [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=787.9399999999999s)]
*  you're getting sufficient, I believe you should get [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=789.1199999999999s)]
*  sufficient vegetables, fruits. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=791.68s)]
*  And if it's in your nutrition plan, starches, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=794.1999999999999s)]
*  things like rice and oatmeal and things like that. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=798.8s)]
*  If that's what you do. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=800.76s)]
*  I realized today people are doing a variety [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=801.68s)]
*  of different things. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=803.3199999999999s)]
*  Now the bone broth and collagen protein, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=804.8s)]
*  yes, will factor into your total protein count, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=807.76s)]
*  that protein ration of one gram per pound [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=810.84s)]
*  of body weight per day. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=813.56s)]
*  But keep in mind that if you evaluate bone broth [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=814.8s)]
*  or especially powdered collagen proteins [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=818.6s)]
*  through the lens of what is high quality bioavailable, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=821.04s)]
*  high leucine content protein, collagen protein [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=825.28s)]
*  or rather powdered collagen protein [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=828.44s)]
*  doesn't scale up that well. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=831.0s)]
*  And so I would say if you are interested [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=833.1400000000001s)]
*  in improving your skin health and appearance, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=835.9000000000001s)]
*  sure, go ahead and add 15 grams of collagen protein [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=837.86s)]
*  in powdered form per day or have some bone broth. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=840.9200000000001s)]
*  I happen to really like bone broth. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=843.4000000000001s)]
*  It also has a fair amount of protein. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=844.8800000000001s)]
*  And I believe I need to double check this, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=847.08s)]
*  but I believe that some of them actually have fair amounts [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=849.4200000000001s)]
*  of leucine, just not as high as whey protein. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=853.0200000000001s)]
*  Okay, so I want to be clear about that [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=855.44s)]
*  because the question was about a comparison [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=856.76s)]
*  between bone broth, collagen protein and whey protein. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=858.4399999999999s)]
*  One last thing about skin health as it relates [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=862.3199999999999s)]
*  to whey protein. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=864.48s)]
*  On the episode I did about skin health, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=866.24s)]
*  I read a number of papers and then we addressed [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=867.88s)]
*  these papers again when I had Dr. Teo Selimani [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=871.22s)]
*  on the podcast. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=874.0s)]
*  He's actually a derm onc or a dermatologist oncologist [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=875.16s)]
*  specializes in skin cancers, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=878.8s)]
*  but also the cosmetic aspects of skincare. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=880.18s)]
*  You know, what makes skin have nice levels of elasticity, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=883.08s)]
*  reducing things like rosacea, psoriasis and acne. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=886.34s)]
*  And in that discussion and in the papers that I covered [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=889.74s)]
*  in the solo episode, it was clear that one of the things [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=892.58s)]
*  that has been shown to contribute to acne in some people, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=897.02s)]
*  okay, not all, but in some people, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=900.5400000000001s)]
*  is having a high leucine content in the diet. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=903.14s)]
*  Okay, so this runs countercurrent [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=906.5400000000001s)]
*  to everything I've said before, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=907.94s)]
*  but I would be remiss if I didn't say this. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=909.38s)]
*  Whey protein has been evaluated for its tendency [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=912.0400000000001s)]
*  to increase acne in some people. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=914.42s)]
*  And it seems to be related to leucine, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=916.8199999999999s)]
*  which again is quite present in whey protein [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=919.5s)]
*  and leucine's ability to increase certain components [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=923.02s)]
*  of the cell growth pathway involving mTOR, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=925.5s)]
*  mammalian target of rapamycin. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=927.8199999999999s)]
*  There's a whole discussion to have about mTOR [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=929.9399999999999s)]
*  that we don't have time to get into right now. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=932.5799999999999s)]
*  I don't think you should be afraid of whey protein [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=935.3s)]
*  because you think it will induce acne. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=937.38s)]
*  What seems to be the case here is that [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=939.78s)]
*  the high leucine content and probably other things [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=941.94s)]
*  in whey protein that are effective in increasing insulin [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=944.48s)]
*  lead to increases in mTOR, [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=948.6800000000001s)]
*  which in turn lead to changes in the skin [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=950.98s)]
*  that sometimes show up as increased acne. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=952.6600000000001s)]
*  Again, I'm not saying that taking whey protein [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=955.5600000000001s)]
*  will increase your acne. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=957.7s)]
*  What I am saying is, if you have issues with acne, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=958.9200000000001s)]
*  you might try taking out whey protein [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=962.2600000000001s)]
*  for a couple of days or weeks. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=964.9200000000001s)]
*  And by doing so, see whether or not whey protein [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=966.7800000000001s)]
*  is causing or exacerbating those acne symptoms. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=968.68s)]
*  I personally have never noticed that issue with whey protein, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=972.0s)]
*  but others might. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=975.38s)]
*  And indeed there are some peer reviewed manuscripts [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=976.3199999999999s)]
*  that point to that. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=978.6999999999999s)]
*  And as a final point, one thing that became clear [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=979.8399999999999s)]
*  in offline discussions with Dr. Teo Soleimani [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=981.7199999999999s)]
*  about this whey protein leucine acne thing [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=984.26s)]
*  is that for women in particular [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=987.68s)]
*  whose hormones cycle across the month, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=989.9599999999999s)]
*  they may find that whey protein [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=992.5999999999999s)]
*  and other high leucine protein sources [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=994.2199999999999s)]
*  will exacerbate or create acne [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=997.38s)]
*  at particular phases of their cycle [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=999.78s)]
*  because of the interaction between that mTOR pathway [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=1001.64s)]
*  and some of the hormones that fluctuate [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=1004.14s)]
*  during different phases of the menstrual cycle. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=1006.42s)]
*  So we all have to learn to be scientists of ourselves. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=1008.9s)]
*  That is to try something, see if we like it, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=1011.9399999999999s)]
*  see if we don't, ask ourselves why. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=1014.8199999999999s)]
*  If you get stomach discomfort [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=1017.2199999999999s)]
*  from a given brand of whey protein, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=1018.3s)]
*  please don't take that one again. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=1019.62s)]
*  You have to find what works for you [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=1021.74s)]
*  and then pay attention to whether or not, for instance, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=1023.74s)]
*  if you're a woman and you're seeing some increase in acne [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=1026.58s)]
*  or other skin symptoms by taking whey protein [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=1028.94s)]
*  at a particular phase of your cycle, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=1031.74s)]
*  maybe you stop taking it during that phase [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=1033.18s)]
*  and take it only in other phases. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=1035.02s)]

*  take whey protein out altogether, [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=1051.78s)]
*  maybe replace it with a casein protein [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wRvsiGYIs&t=1053.56s)]
