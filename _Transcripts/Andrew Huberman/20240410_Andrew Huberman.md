# Dr. Matt Walker: Protocols to Improve Your Sleep | Huberman Lab Guest Series
**Andrew Huberman:** [April 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvPGfcAgk9Y)
*  Welcome to the Huberman Lab guest series,
*  where I and an expert guest discuss science
*  and science-based tools for everyday life.
*  I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology
*  and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.
*  Today marks the second episode
*  in our six episode series, All About Sleep,
*  with our expert guest, Dr. Matthew Walker.
*  During today's episode, we discuss the do's
*  and the do nots of sleep, focusing, for instance,
*  on how to use light and absence of light,
*  as well as temperature, both of your sleep environment,
*  specifically the room you're in, your body temperature,
*  and much more, in order to regulate the timing
*  and quality of your sleep.
*  And we discuss how things like alcohol, caffeine,
*  and cannabis impact sleep and the various stages of sleep.
*  And we discuss the various tools that exist now
*  and that are rapidly becoming available
*  to improve your sleep.
*  This episode is essential
*  for anyone trying to optimize their sleep.
*  And when I say optimize your sleep,
*  I mean trying to optimize the formula
*  that was addressed in the first episode of the series,
*  which is the QQRT formula, the quality, quantity,
*  regularity, and timing of your sleep,
*  four variables that combine to determine
*  whether or not your sleep is optimized for you
*  and thereby providing the most restoration and improvement
*  to your mental health, physical health, and performance.
*  Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize
*  that this podcast is separate
*  from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
*  It is, however, part of my desire and effort
*  to bring zero cost to consumer information
*  about science and science related tools
*  to the general public.
*  In keeping with that theme,
*  I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
*  Our first sponsor is Helix Sleep.
*  Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows
*  that are customized to your unique sleep needs.
*  It's abundantly clear that sleep is the foundation
*  of mental health, physical health, and performance.
*  When we're getting enough quality sleep,
*  everything in life goes so much better.
*  And when we are not getting enough quality sleep,
*  everything in life is that much more challenging.
*  And one of the key things to getting a great night's sleep
*  is to have the appropriate mattress.
*  Everyone, however, has slightly different needs
*  in terms of what would be the optimal mattress for them.
*  Helix understands that people have unique sleep needs,
*  and they've designed a brief two minute quiz
*  that asks you questions like,
*  do you sleep on your back, your side, or your stomach?
*  Do you tend to run hot or cold during the night?
*  Or maybe you don't know the answers to those questions.
*  If you go to the Helix site and take that brief quiz,
*  they'll match you to a mattress that's optimal for you.
*  For me, it turned out to be the Dusk, D-U-S-K mattress.
*  It's not too hard, not too soft,
*  and I sleep so much better on my Helix mattress
*  than on any other type of mattress I've used before.
*  So if you're interested in upgrading your mattress,
*  go to helixsleep.com slash Huberman,
*  take their brief two minute sleep quiz,
*  and they'll match you to a customized mattress for you.
*  And you'll get up to $350 off any mattress order
*  and two free pillows.
*  Again, that's helixsleep.com slash Huberman
*  to save up to $350 off and two free pillows.
*  Today's episode is also brought to us by Whoop.
*  Whoop is a fitness wearable device
*  that tracks your daily activity and sleep,
*  but also goes beyond that by providing real time feedback
*  on how to adjust your training and sleep schedule
*  to perform better.
*  I've been working with Whoop
*  on their scientific advisory council
*  to try and help advance Whoop's mission
*  of unlocking human performance.
*  As a Whoop user, I've experienced the health benefits
*  of their technology firsthand for sleep tracking,
*  for monitoring other features of my physiology,
*  and for giving me a lot of feedback
*  about metrics within my brain and body
*  that tell me how hard I should train or not train,
*  and basically point to the things that I'm doing correctly
*  and incorrectly in my daily life
*  that I can adjust using protocols,
*  some of which are actually within the Whoop app.
*  Given that many of us have goals
*  such as improving our sleep, building better habits,
*  or just focusing more on our overall health,
*  Whoop is one of the tools that can really help you
*  get personalized data, recommendations, and coaching
*  toward your overall health.
*  If you're interested in trying Whoop,
*  you can go to join.whoop.com slash Huberman today
*  to get your first month free.
*  Again, that's join.whoop.com slash Huberman.
*  Today's episode is also brought to us by Waking Up.
*  Waking Up is a meditation app
*  that has hundreds of different meditations
*  as well as scripts for yoga nidra
*  and non-sleep deep rest or NSDR protocols.
*  By now, there's an abundance of data showing
*  that even short daily meditations
*  can greatly improve our mood, reduce anxiety,
*  improve our ability to focus, and can improve our memory.
*  And while there are many different forms of meditation,
*  most people find it difficult to find and stick
*  to a meditation practice in a way
*  that is most beneficial for them.
*  The Waking Up app makes it extremely easy
*  to learn how to meditate
*  and to carry out your daily meditation practice
*  in a way that's going to be most effective
*  and efficient for you.
*  It includes a variety of different types of meditations
*  of different duration, as well as things like yoga nidra,
*  which place the brain and body into a sort of pseudo sleep
*  that allows you to emerge feeling
*  incredibly mentally refreshed.
*  In fact, the science around yoga nidra is really impressive
*  showing that after a yoga nidra session,
*  levels of dopamine in certain areas of the brain
*  are enhanced by up to 60%,
*  which places the brain and body
*  into a state of enhanced readiness
*  for mental work and for physical work.
*  Another thing I really like about the Waking Up app
*  is that it provides a 30-day introduction course.
*  So for those of you that have not meditated before
*  or getting back to a meditation practice, that's fantastic.
*  Or if you're somebody who's already a skilled
*  and regular meditator,
*  Waking Up has more advanced meditations
*  and yoga nidra sessions for you as well.
*  If you'd like to try the Waking Up app,
*  you can go to wakingup.com slash Huberman
*  and access a free 30-day trial.
*  Again, that's wakingup.com slash Huberman.
*  And now for my conversation with Dr. Matthew Walker.
*  Professor Matt Walker, welcome back.
*  We're all so happy to have you here.
*  And in episode one, you beautifully described
*  the biology of sleep, why sleep is important,
*  what happens when we don't get enough sleep,
*  and you incentivized getting adequate amounts
*  of great sleep.
*  And you defined what great sleep is,
*  and you provided some excellent practical protocols
*  and tools for getting great sleep.
*  However, today you're going to tell us, I believe,
*  about the protocols for really optimizing one's sleep,
*  both conventional tools and protocols,
*  and some, let's say, unconventional.
*  Not heretical, but unconventional tools
*  for optimizing one's sleep.
*  So let's start with the basics.
*  What are the basics of what I think I've heard you refer
*  to previously as sleep hygiene?
*  Yeah, I think many of us can resonate
*  with the idea of dental hygiene.
*  But turns out there's something called sleep hygiene.
*  And there are probably, I would say,
*  five edicts of sleep hygiene.
*  I offer them as tools and not necessarily rules,
*  because I don't think people respond to rules.
*  People respond to reasons and not rules.
*  So if it's okay, I'll probably just unpack each one of them
*  rather than just sort of bark them at you
*  and hope people assume that it's the right answer.
*  I'll explain the answer so people understand
*  why it's important.
*  So as I said, there are probably five things
*  that you can start doing tonight
*  to try to improve your sleep.
*  The first we've spoken a little bit about
*  in that first episode,
*  it's part of the four macros of good sleep.
*  First piece of advice, regularity.
*  Go to bed at the same time and wake up at the same time,
*  no matter whether it's the weekday or the weekend.
*  Regularity is king.
*  And the reason is because when you feed your brain
*  the signals of timed regularity for your sleep,
*  it will anchor your sleep and improve the quantity
*  and the quality of that sleep.
*  Because part of that signal of regularity
*  going into your brain in terms of that repeated behavior,
*  night after night, sleep, in other words,
*  helps train that central 24-hour circadian clock
*  that we also spoke about in the first episode.
*  So that's the first piece of advice.
*  Try to keep it as regular as you possibly can.
*  The second piece of advice is darkness.
*  In my view, we are a dark deprived society
*  in this modern era.
*  And we need darkness at night,
*  as well you've spoken about,
*  to release a hormone called melatonin.
*  A melatonin will help time the regular onset of your sleep.
*  So that sounds great, but boots on the ground, Matt,
*  what does that mean?
*  I would suggest the following.
*  In the last hour before bed, try to dim down 50%,
*  if not more, of your lights in your home.
*  And you will be quite surprised
*  at how sleepy and soporific that will make you feel.
*  I will do this in a regimented way.
*  I have a little reminder that pops up
*  and tells me now is the time to dim the lights
*  based on your bedtime.
*  And I'll go around and I'll shut lights down.
*  In my bedroom, I will actually have a small light bulb,
*  and it is way down to probably as little as maybe five lux.
*  And lux is just a metric of the light.
*  It's way down there and it's also very deep orange,
*  sort of red, and we can come onto why that's the case.
*  So that's the first thing,
*  even before you're thinking about sleep,
*  start to decrease the light.
*  For example, if you were there at,
*  let's say for a standard sleep schedule at 10 p.m.,
*  and normally you are getting into bed at 10.30 p.m.,
*  but you feel pretty wide awake.
*  If there was an electrical blackout
*  and you lost your phone, magnetic too,
*  phone goes down, lights go down, total blackout.
*  My suspicion is that fairly soon you'd say,
*  gosh, I actually feel quite sleepy.
*  Whereas if the lights were blazing,
*  you've got your phone, televisions on, lots of stimulation,
*  you're probably going to think 10.30,
*  no, I could probably push through
*  for at least another hour.
*  So try to dissipate that light.
*  And then if you need to, wear an eye mask,
*  blackout curtains, always good as well.
*  But we need that darkness at night
*  because when you give the brain the signal of darkness,
*  it releases effectively a brake pedal.
*  That brake pedal has normally been applied by way of light
*  on the release of that spigot of melatonin.
*  And when you take the brake pedal off,
*  it starts pumping out into the brain.
*  You can also then, of course,
*  probably reverse engineer this trick in the morning.
*  And this is another component of why you've been,
*  I think, such a wonderful advocate for light in the morning.
*  It does many things, but one of the things that it does
*  is reapply that brake on melatonin,
*  and therefore you lose the signal to your brain of darkness.
*  That's what melatonin in some ways is doing.
*  We often call it the hormone of darkness
*  or the vampire hormone.
*  Not necessarily because it makes you look longingly
*  at people's necklines and want to bite in,
*  which is great if you're into that.
*  But it's really simply about it's releasing melatonin,
*  which tells the brain, my goodness, it's nighttime.
*  But if you've got bright light on,
*  you come from your office, you're driving home,
*  so you've got artificial light during the day,
*  which is probably not strong enough to stimulate you
*  and bring you awake.
*  You come home and you've got, again, bright light,
*  but it's still strong enough now
*  to prevent the release of melatonin.
*  You start to shift in your timing,
*  and you may have problems with your sleep.
*  So that's the second piece of advice.
*  I would love to ask you about that morning light too
*  and the alertness benefits.
*  I'm, as a sleep researcher, more focused
*  on the evening component of light and decreasing it,
*  but you've done a great job.
*  I don't know if there's anything.
*  There are a couple of quick points
*  that are based on some, what I consider really nice studies.
*  There's beautiful work in human showing
*  that bright light exposure in the morning,
*  especially from sunlight,
*  but if one doesn't have access to sunlight
*  for whatever reason, there are commercially available
*  so-called SAD lamps, Seasonal Affective Disorder lamps.
*  They range anywhere from 5,000 to 10,000 lux, very bright.
*  But certainly morning sunlight viewing
*  and lamps of the sort I just described
*  have been shown to increase the amplitude
*  of the morning cortisol spike by as much as 50%, five zero.
*  So people hear cortisol and they freak out.
*  They think that's not good.
*  I want my cortisol low,
*  but you actually want your cortisol highest in the morning
*  and lower in the afternoon and evening.
*  And there's a lot of reasons for that elevated mood focus
*  and alertness in the morning and throughout the day
*  and ease of getting to sleep at night, lower anxiety,
*  lower depressive symptoms and so on.
*  So that bright light also serves to control
*  the amplitude of cortisol in the direction you want
*  in the early part of the day.
*  The other thing that's just more of a underlying dynamics
*  of the circadian visual system,
*  which is a system that I worked on for years,
*  these wonderful cells in the eyes
*  that are not for image forming,
*  but rather for detecting sunlight and bright light
*  for sake of setting circadian rhythm
*  is that the sensitivity of that system early in the day
*  is actually quite low.
*  So you need a lot of bright light early in the day
*  to effectively wake up your system
*  and shut down the sleepiness signals such as melatonin.
*  But later in the day, it's a rather diabolical system.
*  It takes very little light, even from artificial sources,
*  to disrupt your circadian rhythm and quash melatonin.
*  As little as 15 seconds of bright light in the evening,
*  I think Chuck Zeisler's laboratory
*  at Harvard Medical School showed,
*  can quash melatonin in the evening.
*  Now I don't want people to freak out
*  and think that they go into a hotel bathroom,
*  which oftentimes those are very bright.
*  In the middle of the night,
*  flip on the light that they're going to completely
*  screw up their circadian rhythms.
*  But if I'm honest,
*  they'd be much better off using their phone
*  as a flashlight to navigate.
*  People always say, well, wait,
*  but the flashlight on the phone is very bright,
*  but let's just get logical here.
*  A light shown into your eyes, such as a flashlight,
*  is very different than looking
*  at a flashlight beam on the ground.
*  Far and away difference.
*  So the point is that if you don't get enough
*  bright sunlight or light in your eyes early in the day,
*  and then you're indoors under artificial lighting,
*  you might think, well, this is really bright lighting.
*  This is the kind of lighting
*  that could disrupt my circadian rhythm at night,
*  and therefore it's sufficient to wake up my system.
*  No, early in the day and throughout the day,
*  you need a lot of bright light,
*  as much as it's safely possible to avoid sunburn
*  and things of that sort, which you don't want.
*  But then as the evening comes around, after sundown,
*  you need very little artificial light
*  in order to disrupt your circadian rhythm.
*  And then just very quickly, light from candles,
*  fireplaces is okay.
*  This is kind of interesting.
*  It seems bright, but the measurements indicate
*  that that's not gonna shift your circadian rhythm much.
*  Candles are great, but of course,
*  don't burn your house down.
*  So the orange and red tones in the evening, way dimmed down,
*  that's the way to go.
*  Early in the day, bright, bright, bright light,
*  as bright as you safely can tolerate.
*  And what I like about, firstly, your mention of cortisol,
*  you described how cortisol is rising in the morning,
*  and that's a great thing, and it is a good thing.
*  And in the evening, it's starting to drop.
*  And if you look right around your prototypical bedtime,
*  and we're going to speak later in this episode
*  as to what your real natural bedtime is
*  versus the one that you may be taking right now,
*  it's very interesting.
*  Cortisol will almost hit its lowest point,
*  something that we call it nadir,
*  it's the lowest point in that trough of its decline
*  right around the time when you should be sleeping.
*  However, there's a great study
*  that looked at people with insomnia.
*  And in subsequent episodes, we'll discuss this too,
*  but one of the ways that we think about
*  or conceptualize insomnia is in two different flavors,
*  sleep onset insomnia, I can't fall asleep,
*  and sleep maintenance insomnia,
*  I wake up, I can't get back to sleep.
*  And what they looked at was essentially cortisol levels,
*  they had a catheter in the arm,
*  and they were sampling it from the bloodstream,
*  and they were able to do that every 30 minutes.
*  So it's a little bit like time-lapse photography,
*  and you're getting a data point every 30 minutes
*  across the 24-hour period.
*  Looking at cortisol across now a full 24-hour period.
*  And sure enough, when you look at healthy controls
*  who can sleep well and insomnia patients,
*  they look almost identical across the day.
*  But then when it comes to falling asleep
*  right around that bedtime period,
*  the healthy controls are going all the way down.
*  The insomnia patients go down and down and down,
*  and then they have a rise back up
*  right around that sleep onset period.
*  And then they start to drop back down again
*  just as the control group,
*  but then they also often will have a spike
*  in the middle of the night, which then comes down.
*  And then both of them are staying low
*  throughout the early morning period,
*  and then it starts to rise back up.
*  So it's not as though net-net overall,
*  there is a higher level of cortisol
*  in people with insomnia.
*  It seems to be right at those trigger zones
*  that map very nicely to sleep onset problems
*  and sleep maintenance problems.
*  Very interesting.
*  As somebody who wakes up in the middle of the night
*  and sometimes has trouble getting back to sleep,
*  that resonates.
*  I have no trouble falling asleep whatsoever.
*  Yeah.
*  Knock on wood.
*  Superstitious about this at this point.
*  But I use tools like non-sleep deep rest,
*  yoga nidra, long exhale breathing.
*  But, you know, and I think these wake up episodes
*  seem to happen more when I'm processing a lot of stuff
*  from my daily life.
*  That's right.
*  You know, the unconscious brain oftentimes
*  is working through things and will wake us up.
*  Yeah, I often think that sleep maintenance insomnia
*  that you've just described is the revenge
*  of daytime emotions unresolved.
*  That's a great way to put it.
*  Yeah.
*  So that would be, so we've spoken about regularity,
*  we've spoken about darkness,
*  and we've spoken about the inverse of that in the morning,
*  which is light, a little bit of cortisol.
*  So the third out of the five is going to be temperature.
*  And the advice here is keep it cool.
*  As we mentioned a little bit in the first episode,
*  and we will go into great detail when we speak,
*  not just about these conventional and unconventional tips,
*  but we're also going to go into the future of science
*  and where sleep science is taking us to, in fact,
*  optimize and even enhance our sleep.
*  We will speak a lot about temperature.
*  Suffice to say that you need to drop your core
*  body temperature and your brain temperature
*  by a little less than one degree Celsius,
*  two to three degrees Fahrenheit,
*  to get to sleep and stay asleep.
*  The general target that we have in sleep science,
*  if you look across the literature,
*  is somewhere around about a 67 degree Fahrenheit,
*  or I'm trying to do the calculation,
*  maybe 18.5-ish degrees Celsius.
*  Now I know that that sounds cold, and cold it is,
*  but you can also wear thick socks to bed,
*  you can have a hot water bottle at the end of the bed,
*  that's great too, but the ambient must be cold.
*  The fourth piece of advice is walk it out,
*  and here what I mean is do not stay in bed
*  for long periods of time awake.
*  And I think we mentioned this,
*  perhaps in the first episode too,
*  when you are awake in your bed for long stretches of time,
*  because your brain is an incredibly associative device,
*  it will quickly learn that this thing called my bed
*  is the place where I'm awake and not asleep.
*  And what you need to do is break that association.
*  If you've learned that time and time again,
*  because you've stayed in bed, and the rule of thumb,
*  and it's just a rule of thumb, about 20, 25 minutes,
*  if you can't fall back asleep or you can't fall asleep,
*  it's okay, just say, tonight is not my night,
*  it's not a problem, tomorrow is not completely shot,
*  it's fine, I'm just going to get up, get out of bed,
*  if you can, if you're lucky enough,
*  try to go to a different room, and in dim light,
*  read a book, listen to a podcast,
*  whatever it is that relaxes you, just do that,
*  don't check email, don't eat, because if you start eating,
*  that again trains your brain to start waking up
*  and feeding at that time.
*  And only return to bed when you are sleepy,
*  and there is no time limit for that.
*  I don't want you to come back after half an hour
*  when you are still awake and not feeling sleepy enough.
*  Why? Because you're going to get back into bed
*  and be in the same problem again.
*  And gradually, if you do this, and it's hard to do it,
*  you will relearn the association that you had,
*  I'm sure, as a child, which is that your bed
*  is this place of sleepiness,
*  because often people will be saying,
*  I feel so tired in the evening,
*  and then they get into bed and they say,
*  but now I can't fall asleep at all,
*  and I don't understand it,
*  in part it's because of that learned association.
*  So that would be the fourth tip.
*  The fifth tip makes me even more unpopular
*  as a personality and character,
*  which is try to be mindful of your alcohol and caffeine.
*  Now, in a subsequent episode,
*  we'll go into great detail as to how caffeine works,
*  its mechanisms, why it is sleep disruptive,
*  and why, in fact, I've even perhaps changed my mind
*  on caffeine and its benefits,
*  but it also does have significant detriments to your sleep.
*  So the rule of thumb here would be,
*  try to cut yourself off from caffeine
*  probably at least 10 or so hours
*  before you expect to go to bed,
*  and you can just calculate back, calculate that,
*  and try to limit it.
*  So the dose and the timing make the poison.
*  Cut yourself off after maybe two or three cups of coffee,
*  and then that timing component,
*  count yourself back, cut yourself off.
*  Decaffeinated coffee, not too bad
*  if you find the right thing to, if you need that fix.
*  Alcohol is probably one of the most misunderstood sleep aids
*  in quotes that there is.
*  It is no sleep aid at all.
*  Now, if I didn't understand what I know
*  about alcohol and sleep, I would think that too,
*  which is, look, when I have a nightcap just before bed,
*  or two, even though I don't wear them,
*  I may actually just fall asleep very easily.
*  It feels like I stay asleep very soundly across the night.
*  So it's a great sleep aid, and it really helps me.
*  There are at least, I would say, three issues with alcohol.
*  The first is that alcohol is in a class of drugs
*  that we call the sedatives, and sedation is not sleep.
*  But when you take on board alcohol in the evening,
*  you mistake the former for the latter,
*  and you think it helps you fall asleep.
*  The second thing is that because it's sedation,
*  or actually it's probably related to sedation,
*  if I were to show you the electrical signature
*  of your deep sleep when you're just sleeping naturally
*  versus when you have alcohol in your system,
*  it's not really the same.
*  It's not a naturalistic form of deep sleep.
*  It mimics it.
*  It looks not too dissimilar.
*  But if I really do my analyses,
*  and I almost like that Pink Floyd album
*  where I take the white light of electrical brain activity
*  coming from your head as you're sleeping
*  and split it apart into all of the different components,
*  there are some components that are no longer present,
*  or some that are abnormally present.
*  The second issue with alcohol is that it fragments your sleep.
*  So it will litter your sleep
*  with all these punctuated awakenings throughout the night.
*  The danger there is that many of those awakenings
*  with alcohol you don't remember because they're too brief.
*  But then you wake up the next day and you think,
*  well, I didn't have a problem falling asleep.
*  I didn't have a problem staying asleep,
*  but I just feel rough.
*  I just don't feel restored by my sleep.
*  And you don't add two and two together.
*  The final concern with alcohol is that it's quite a potent
*  blocker of your rapid eye movement sleep or REM sleep.
*  And in subsequent episodes, we'll go into great detail
*  as to the incredible learning and memory,
*  creativity benefits that come by way of REM sleep.
*  Also, it's essential for our emotional regulation
*  and recalibrating our moods.
*  So for all of those reasons, I would say two things.
*  First, if you are struggling with sleep,
*  not feeling restored by your sleep,
*  keep in mind your alcohol intake.
*  And also just in general, be mindful of that.
*  If you are thinking about your sleep and want to preserve it.
*  So much of what you just said resonates.
*  I confess that in my lifetime, I've had periods
*  of pretty spectacular sleep.
*  I characterize myself as somebody that could fall asleep
*  anywhere, anytime.
*  But I've also experienced the extreme challenges of sleep.
*  And that relates to different things,
*  life circumstances, et cetera.
*  In fact, recently I've had some challenges with sleep,
*  despite using the protocols that I and others suggest.
*  I hadn't heard some of the things that you're referring
*  to here, and middle of the night waking
*  has become more of an issue.
*  I communicated this to a former girlfriend of mine
*  who I was in relationship with when I was a junior professor,
*  meaning before I got tenure.
*  And she said, you don't remember.
*  You had a, Andrew, but I do.
*  You had a pattern back then of after I would fall asleep,
*  you would continue working on your laptop,
*  probably on grants.
*  And then I would fall asleep working.
*  And then according to her, I would wake up
*  in the middle of the night and work a little bit
*  until I'd get tired again and then fall asleep.
*  And then this would repeat.
*  So really stamping down the associative learning element
*  that you talked about before.
*  So that was probably the first period of time in my life
*  in which I created this rather deleterious association
*  of work in the middle of the night in bed, right?
*  And then more recently, I've had the experience
*  of waking up probably due to these like daytime things
*  that I'm waking up in the middle of the night thinking about.
*  And now because of our discussion during the course
*  of recording this series, I get out of bed
*  after even 10, 15 minutes so that I can start
*  to eliminate that association.
*  And another piece is that I've always felt
*  that when I get out of bed in the middle of the night
*  because I can't sleep and I go to the sofa,
*  I often can sleep very well.
*  Proving, right?
*  It's a control experiment.
*  Proving that the location of sleep
*  and the association of wakefulness and sleep in bed
*  as opposed to on the sofa is a clear component.
*  And this is in an environment that's of equal temperature.
*  I mean, it's not a perfect experiment, right?
*  It's anecho data as we say.
*  But I think that the associative piece is, oh, so strong
*  for many people.
*  And so this is something to really take seriously.
*  I love that notion of, and people will often say,
*  I just get up, I go to the couch or the sofa
*  and that's where I'll wake up in the morning.
*  Also, they'll say, when I travel and I go to a hotel room,
*  I just can sleep fine.
*  Now, for some people, it's the inverse,
*  but for those people, it's the contextual difference,
*  meaning the change of the environment is so unfamiliar
*  that it has not been bound to association of wakefulness.
*  It's related to sleep or at least the opportunity to sleep.
*  Sometimes even I've heard from some people,
*  there's no studies or data on this,
*  even turning yourself around.
*  Now, this is hard if you have a partner in bed,
*  but you just switch top to bottom of the bed
*  and you take your pillow and you pull the duvet
*  all the way down and you put the pillow at the opposite end
*  where your feet used to be and you get into bed.
*  And even just looking around and sort of having a difference,
*  that alone is so subtle, but it can make a real difference.
*  So again, just keep these things in mind.
*  I know it sounds strange, this whole sort of get up,
*  get out of bed, break the associate,
*  and we'll come onto something.
*  Well, actually I'll come onto it now
*  because I think it's one of the unconventional tips
*  and you mentioned it.
*  A lot of people say to me, that all sounds great.
*  The science makes sense.
*  I just don't, it's dark, it's kind of cold.
*  I really don't want to get out of bed.
*  So give me some alternatives.
*  I think the single best piece
*  of unconventional sleep advice I can give you
*  is do anything that gets your mind off itself.
*  The principle reason that if you look at insomnia
*  as a physiological condition,
*  our current working model mechanistically
*  of how insomnia plays out,
*  is that you are in this state of almost low level anxiety
*  and you are somewhat stressed.
*  And when you go to sleep or you try to go to sleep
*  or you wake back up and you try to get back to sleep,
*  you just have this rolodex of anxiety.
*  In the modern world, we are constantly on reception
*  and very rarely do we do reflection.
*  And unfortunately for many of us,
*  and I've been guilty of this,
*  the only time we do reflection
*  is when our head is placed on the pillow
*  and we turn the light out
*  and that is the last time you want to be doing reflection.
*  That's the worst moment.
*  And at that point, I think everyone can empathize
*  with the idea of you turn the light out,
*  you're under stress, your mind goes to those few things.
*  In the darkness of night,
*  thoughts become almost 10 times worse than they do
*  in the bright of day.
*  And at that moment, you start to ruminate.
*  When you ruminate, you begin to catastrophize.
*  And when you catastrophize,
*  you're dead in the water for the next two hours.
*  So what do you do?
*  The problem is, as I said, your mind is on itself
*  and it's going through these repeated loops.
*  Anything you can do, for example,
*  you can do some kind of a meditation.
*  And when I was researching data for my book some years ago,
*  I did look into meditation and I wasn't a meditator.
*  I was a hard-nosed scientist.
*  I didn't really kind of embrace with that notion
*  or even that group of people.
*  But time and again, I read paper after paper
*  and the data was very strong
*  and it was coming from research groups
*  that I respected very much indeed.
*  So I thought, well, okay, I should probably give this a try.
*  And that was six years ago.
*  And since then, I now meditate for 10 minutes
*  every single night before bed.
*  I do a guided meditation
*  because I'm not particularly skilled.
*  So I use an app that moves me through that.
*  But you can do whatever meditation you like.
*  That's one example.
*  The second example is you can do breathing methods.
*  Because again, you're focused on your breath
*  and what are you not focused on?
*  Your thoughts.
*  And so anything that will allow you to explore
*  some other focus, maybe it's a body scan
*  where you start at the top of your head
*  or you start at your feet and you work your way up
*  and you just say, moving through now my neck,
*  what sensations am I feeling now into my shoulders,
*  moving down into my chest now,
*  I can feel the ends of my fingers, am I sensing anything?
*  And when you start doing that
*  or any of these types of things,
*  the next thing that you remember
*  is your alarm going off in the morning
*  because you got your mind off itself.
*  So I would say that that's probably
*  one of the unconventional tips.
*  But let me come back to the conventional.
*  Anything else I've probably missed out
*  or been unclear about there.
*  Actually, I should probably say one thing
*  in terms of these, they're not tips.
*  I don't like the word.
*  And I know you don't either or hacks
*  these are protocols
*  and they're well informed scientific protocols.
*  In all of this discussion today,
*  you can get all of these things in place
*  and still have problems with sleep.
*  The reason is because you may be suffering
*  from a sleep disorder.
*  So the analogy would be,
*  let's say that I'm your athletic coach
*  and you're a sports superstar.
*  I can perfect everything I can perfect your diet,
*  your supplements, we can perfect your technique,
*  we can perfect.
*  But if you've got a broken ankle,
*  none of those things are going to alter
*  your performance right now.
*  You've got to get to a doctor and get that seen to
*  and then we can come back to fine tuning your performance.
*  It's the same with sleep.
*  If you've got a sleep disorder,
*  such as snoring, sleep apnea or insomnia,
*  we need to get you to a doctor first.
*  And then only after that, come back once you're resolved,
*  then we can start to optimize.
*  That's the only other thing I probably should mention.
*  Yeah, this is all very useful discussion
*  because I think that, of course,
*  there will be those folks out there that just like,
*  what are they talking about?
*  I sleep so well at night.
*  Consider yourself blessed.
*  Many, many people struggle with challenges with sleep.
*  And I think it's fair to say that sooner or later,
*  most everybody experiences some challenges with sleep
*  for whatever reason.
*  If you look at the statistics,
*  that's highly likely in your lifetime,
*  you are more than likely to go through
*  either a period of challenging sleep
*  or in fact, a bout of insomnia.
*  I'd like to take a brief break
*  and acknowledge our sponsor, AG1.
*  AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
*  that also contains adaptogens
*  and is designed to meet all of your foundational
*  nutritional needs.
*  By now, I'm sure you've all heard me say
*  that I've been taking AG1 since 2012.
*  And indeed, that is true.
*  Now, of course, I do consume regular whole foods every day.
*  I strive to get those foods mostly
*  from unprocessed or minimally processed sources.
*  However, I do find it hard to get enough servings
*  of fruits and vegetables each day.
*  So with AG1, I ensure that I get enough
*  of the vitamins, minerals, prebiotic fiber,
*  and other things typically found in fruits or vegetables.
*  And of course, I still make sure
*  to eat fruits and vegetables.
*  And in that way, provide a sort of insurance
*  that I'm getting enough of what I need.
*  In addition, the adaptogens and other micronutrients in AG1
*  really help buffer against stress
*  and ensure that the cells and organs and tissues of my body
*  are getting the things they need.
*  People often ask me that if they were gonna take
*  just one supplement, what that supplement should be.
*  And I always answer AG1.
*  If you'd like to try AG1,
*  you can go to drinkag1.com slash Huberman
*  to claim a special offer.
*  You'll get five free travel packs
*  plus a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
*  Again, that's drinkag1.com slash Huberman.
*  You talked about alcohol.
*  I'm not a consumer of alcohol anymore.
*  Nor am I.
*  And it's not because I have anything against it.
*  Yeah, many people do enjoy it and know,
*  we're not calling judgment on them.
*  I mean, certainly much of the world enjoys alcohol.
*  Could we talk a little bit more about,
*  aside from demolishing REM sleep,
*  do we know that alcohol causes these disruptions
*  in sleep directly, meaning by changing the pattern
*  of release of neurotransmitters like GABA,
*  things of that sort, or is this an indirect effect?
*  Is this like through the gut microbiome
*  that then impacts sleep?
*  And the reason I ask is maybe we could get
*  to some more specific do's and do not protocols.
*  So for instance, if somebody wants to have a cocktail,
*  how close to sleep can they get
*  and not diminish their rapid eye movement sleep too much?
*  Because people are still going to want to drink.
*  And with that said, if people do have a couple of drinks
*  and then they go to sleep,
*  is there anything they can do prior to sleep
*  to try and rescue some of their quality sleep?
*  Great question.
*  So in terms of the mechanism,
*  it seems actually not to be the alcohol,
*  but some of the metabolic byproducts of alcohol.
*  We think that perhaps the main culprit
*  may be some of the aldehydes
*  that are the metabolic separate consequences
*  of alcohol metabolism.
*  You make a good point though,
*  in terms of the dose response timing curve,
*  how late or how early do I have to cut myself off
*  from alcohol?
*  People have done those studies
*  and they have found that even an afternoon,
*  single glass of wine, if you measure sleep
*  in the way that we measure it at Bicenter
*  with high fidelity,
*  you can see compromises and impairments.
*  I wish I could tell you otherwise.
*  I would say that based on that data,
*  the principal protocol advice I would have for you
*  is go to the pub in the morning.
*  That way by the time you're about to sleep,
*  the alcohol is out your system and you could,
*  no, no, I would never, as a public scientist,
*  I would never advocate necessarily for morning,
*  I'm just kidding you.
*  But that's sort of one of the unfortunate consequences.
*  There does seem to be an impact to say that there isn't,
*  is just me not being truthful about the data.
*  But again, if you think about the trade off here,
*  if you're going out or you're having friends over
*  and you're gonna make an incredible evening of memories
*  and you're going to open a favorite bottle of wine
*  and have a couple of glasses of wine,
*  is your sleep going to be compromised?
*  Yes, it is.
*  But maybe that's worth the trade off
*  for that specific night.
*  I would just not wish you to,
*  and you've spoken a lot and so has our dear friend,
*  Peter Atiyah and others,
*  there just doesn't seem to be any safe amount of alcohol.
*  But I would say think about that trade off simply,
*  however, don't make it a habit that you're doing it,
*  multiple nights a week or more,
*  that would probably be the advice.
*  Great.
*  What about food and sleep?
*  How close to sleep?
*  Is it okay to have a meal if you want to optimize your sleep?
*  I like to eat my final meal somewhere around 6.30 p.m.
*  and I go to sleep somewhere around 8.39 p.m.
*  In an ideal world, sometimes I go to sleep a bit later.
*  Sometimes I eat a little bit later.
*  There's some variability with these.
*  But put differently, what is the relationship
*  between food intake and sleep quality
*  in terms of timing of food intake?
*  And then perhaps we can talk a little bit
*  about food macronutrients.
*  It's very interesting.
*  There was somewhat of a dogma out there
*  that we have to stop eating three or four hours before bed
*  for optimal sleep.
*  If you look at the data, the data is quite a spread,
*  no pun intended.
*  There are some people for whom that works very well
*  and if they eat even two hours before bed,
*  they just get disrupted in terms of their sleep.
*  Some of that is about people just feeling too full
*  and not feeling comfortable.
*  Other aspects are that when you become recumbent,
*  when you lie down, you have a higher risk
*  of gastric reflux coming back up
*  and therefore you get heartburn and that's pretty miserable
*  and people will describe that too by way of
*  closer proximity of food intake
*  relative to when you're falling asleep.
*  Nevertheless, if you look at the data
*  and I did a recent very deep dive on this personally myself
*  about 12 months ago, it's not quite as extreme
*  as the dogma makes out.
*  If you eat two hours before bed, on average,
*  it doesn't seem to necessarily harm your sleep.
*  Now, that's very different than saying
*  what is best to improve or enhance your sleep
*  but the way these studies were designed,
*  it was looking at detriments.
*  They then went to 90 minutes before sleep onset
*  and even there, there didn't seem to be market imperments.
*  60 minutes, you start to see maybe some signs
*  but on average, the effect size was somewhat weak
*  but then when you get close to sort of 45 minutes or so,
*  then things did start to deteriorate.
*  I think it depends hugely on your chronotype
*  and also just on your appetite,
*  circadian rhythm preferences too.
*  I am someone who I do not feel very hungry
*  when I first wake up in the morning.
*  I don't feel very hungry throughout most of the day
*  and I will onboard most of my calories probably
*  in the hours, probably in about a four hour period,
*  maybe less, even three hour period
*  and then I will cut myself off
*  about 90 minutes before sleep.
*  So I, classically, I would have been considered as,
*  you know, violating this sleep dogma
*  of cutting yourself off at least three hours.
*  I think it's very personal though, just experiment with it.
*  You will know the situation.
*  As for macros and specific food components,
*  the data is a little bit mixed.
*  Certainly what we know is that if you're eating a diet
*  that is high in sugar and low in protein,
*  your sleep is worse.
*  Why would that be the case?
*  Well, one of the reasons that we think is that
*  if you onboard sugar,
*  it can be somewhat metabolically active
*  and when it becomes metabolically active,
*  it can increase your body temperature,
*  your core body temperature, even just very subtly,
*  but that's enough to disrupt your sleep
*  as we spoke about with temperature.
*  But I think in terms of really the,
*  what would be the ideal macro nutrient
*  even micro nutrient dietary recommendation
*  that I would have for you?
*  I don't think we have enough data yet
*  above and beyond that statement.
*  Yeah, I've experienced when I eat
*  a very low carbohydrate diet,
*  which I've experimented with in the past,
*  maybe even full ketogenic diet for brief periods of time,
*  although I'm an omnivore, so I eat meat and eggs
*  and I also eat starches, pastas, rice, et cetera.
*  But we know based on beautiful work from,
*  for example, Chris Palmer from Harvard Medical School,
*  who is a guest on this podcast.
*  I listened to that, it was a great podcast.
*  Yeah, Chris is spectacular
*  and has advocated the exploration of ketogenic diets
*  for the treatment of various psychiatric conditions,
*  not all, but psychiatric conditions.
*  And it seems, and he agreed with me on this,
*  that when people go on very low starch,
*  very low carbohydrate diets,
*  that sometimes they can experience a bit of hypomania.
*  Some people can and challenge this with sleep.
*  And sometimes there are psychiatric reasons
*  why people stay on those diets anyway,
*  and then they have to do other things
*  to encourage their sleep,
*  either pharmacology or supplementation or some combination.
*  But I can say anecdotally for myself,
*  if I don't eat starches for a extended amount of time,
*  a couple of days,
*  I find it very hard to get quality sleep,
*  as indicated by sleep trackers
*  and just latency to fall asleep is longer than it is,
*  et cetera.
*  So I've opted to eat most of my carbohydrates
*  later in the evening,
*  which violates every rule of,
*  eat your carbs early in the day.
*  And I think there are some data to support
*  that eating carbohydrates early in the day
*  may actually have certain benefits
*  for weight maintenance or weight loss.
*  So I realized that,
*  but those aren't my goals at the moment.
*  Weight maintenance, yes, weight loss, no.
*  So I think I certainly feel after eating a dinner
*  that has a bit more starch, pasta, rice,
*  these things of that sort,
*  and a little bit lower protein,
*  as opposed to the inverse,
*  like eating a couple of ribeye steaks and a salad,
*  but no starch, that my sleep is substantially better.
*  And I always attributed that to the relationship
*  between some of these starches
*  and the tryptophan slash serotonin pathway.
*  Yeah, there is some data on that
*  with the carbohydrate intake in the evening.
*  And of course that tryptophan and that carbohydrate intake
*  will contain the precursor ingredients
*  to something else that we've spoken about,
*  which is melatonin.
*  And so that may actually help healthily boost
*  that melatonin signal.
*  There's a little bit of data on that to support it too.
*  We also did a study where we were looking
*  at night to night to night sleep
*  and carbohydrate intake the next day.
*  And it did seem to support what you're describing
*  in terms of some of the carbohydrate benefits.
*  We also found a strange result
*  that was almost the opposite prediction that we made.
*  Carbohydrate intake in the morning too,
*  equally help people wake up.
*  And we were a little bit uncertain as to why,
*  but we're going to go into more detail.
*  The reason that you mentioned the suggestion
*  of not to take on carbs in the evening
*  is in part based on the evidence
*  that your body's ability to dispose of sugar.
*  And obviously when you're eating carbohydrate,
*  you can have a higher spike of sugar.
*  Now that in part depends on what you're eating
*  with that carbohydrate and also of course
*  the nature of that carbohydrate,
*  whether it's simple or whether it's complex,
*  whether it's simple sugars versus complex,
*  more starchy carbohydrate.
*  But the idea is that your body,
*  even if you were to eat the same amount of carbohydrate
*  in the morning, in the afternoon or in the evening,
*  same carbohydrate dose and type,
*  but your body's ability to dispose of that
*  without having excessive spikes of glucose
*  is worse in the evening, better in the morning,
*  i.e. if you're concerned about your blood sugar
*  and your metabolic health, maybe that's what you should do.
*  I think that that data is unclear on the basis of
*  if you are glycemic normal,
*  meaning that you currently do not have signs of type 2
*  diabetes or you're not pre-diabetic,
*  then that may not necessarily be the case.
*  And so I think that's why it could be beneficial for you.
*  And I know that you think deeply about that
*  and I've even been tracking blood sugar as well.
*  I don't have any signs of that,
*  but I'm just fascinated by some of that data
*  and how it interacts with my sleep
*  because I'm a sleep nerd.
*  So I think right now we just don't have plentiful data
*  to recommend a particular sleep, quote unquote,
*  diet for improved optimization.
*  I would say though that we can be a little bit more relaxed
*  about the timing of our food.
*  Earlier you mentioned caffeine
*  and caffeine is a topic that we get into
*  into substantial depth in episode three,
*  but there and now I will emphasize that
*  caffeine is the most commonly used drug worldwide.
*  I think the statistics says that 90 plus percent of adults
*  consume caffeinated beverages every day,
*  which is remarkable.
*  And a few years back, I recall there was an article
*  in The Economist that charted the countries
*  for which the caffeine consumption was highest
*  and way out on the peak, peak, peak of,
*  it was almost a tripler quadruple
*  what the second place country consumed each day was,
*  can you guess the country that consumes the most caffeine?
*  Could be tea, coffee, any form.
*  I'm gonna suggest it's a Scandinavian country.
*  No, but they're up there.
*  It was Switzerland.
*  Now I don't know if that's still the case,
*  but apparently the Swiss-
*  The reason I went, I was thinking it was,
*  cause I've seen the graph, I was thinking it was Sweden,
*  but hence the Scandinavian.
*  And if I have that wrong,
*  certainly someone will put it in the comments on YouTube.
*  But as I recall, the Swiss drink so much caffeine.
*  They have a lot to think about.
*  So I love caffeine.
*  I drink black coffee, black espresso and yerba mate.
*  I love yerba mate.
*  I've been drinking it since I was a little one
*  because of the Argentines in my family.
*  And I drink it in the early part of the day,
*  typically a couple hours after waking or so,
*  I'll have my first sip of caffeine.
*  And then I try to stop drinking caffeine
*  somewhere around noon or 1 p.m.
*  Occasionally I'll have a shot or two of espresso
*  in the early afternoon if there's important work to be done
*  and I need to do that.
*  But I've noticed that even that can alter my sleep
*  in ways that I don't like.
*  But that afternoon coffee for some reason tastes
*  so much better than the morning coffee for me.
*  I don't know what it is.
*  So it's coffee, yerba mate packed early into the day
*  and a lot of it for me, I have a high tolerance for it.
*  But then I let it taper.
*  Is that an optimal contour of caffeine intake?
*  Would zero caffeine be better
*  if someone's just really committed to sleep
*  and they don't like caffeine?
*  Would zero be better than any?
*  And what about that afternoon coffee
*  or tea containing caffeine?
*  I mean, how disruptive is it for sleep?
*  So the profile that you described,
*  which is high peak early on,
*  and first thing when you wake up
*  and then tapering off nicely down
*  into the sort of early afternoon, ideal.
*  That sounds great to me.
*  As for that afternoon coffee,
*  it really depends again on when you're expecting
*  to go to sleep.
*  Now for someone like you, I would say,
*  I would love to look at abstaining from that
*  or just switching it out to,
*  if you're using these pods or however you're brewing it,
*  let's just switch it out and do an experiment for two weeks.
*  And we will look to see how much is that afternoon coffee
*  really impacting your sleep?
*  And we'll track your sleep with some degree of high fidelity
*  with a wearable.
*  And let's test that hypothesis
*  because you go to sleep quite early.
*  You are an early bird,
*  maybe bordering on an extreme early bird.
*  And we'll speak about,
*  or we have spoken about those different flavors
*  of chronotype.
*  I would prefer you not to be having that caffeine
*  in the afternoon based on how early you go to sleep.
*  And I mentioned that preference
*  because of what you described
*  regarding your sleep maintenance insomnia.
*  One of the issues with caffeine is that not only
*  can it make it more difficult for you to fall asleep,
*  which you don't have in part,
*  because if you're waking up quite frequently
*  throughout the night and struggling to get back to sleep,
*  you're going to be carrying a sleep debt into every night.
*  And that debt continues to grow.
*  And it's almost like compounding interest on the loan.
*  So you will not have a problem falling asleep.
*  In fact, sometimes the speed with which people fall asleep
*  and some of these sleep trackers will almost penalize you
*  for falling asleep too quickly
*  is because in sleep science and clinical sleep medicine,
*  if you're, it should take you somewhere,
*  a healthy sleep onset, five to 15, 20 minutes.
*  But if you put your head on the pillow
*  and you turn off the light
*  and within a minute or so,
*  you're dead to the world and you're gone.
*  I'm exactly, I'm worried that you're a carrying a sleep debt.
*  Now, not necessarily,
*  but I would like to explore it with you.
*  And then I would say, even if you can fall asleep fine,
*  this factor of waking up in the middle of the night
*  is also related to caffeine.
*  Why?
*  Because caffeine not only can make it harder
*  to fall asleep, not your problem,
*  but it keeps you out of that deep, deep sleep.
*  And it puts you into a more shallow state
*  of non-rapid eye movement sleep.
*  And when you are in the shallow state,
*  it's A, easier for you to be woken up,
*  but B, and I think more of the problem,
*  it's harder for you to fall back asleep
*  because your brain doesn't necessarily want to go back down
*  into that deep sleep and nor has it come up
*  out of that deep sleep.
*  So you're not in that wonderful, glorious, thick,
*  trickily sort of sleepy state when you wake up,
*  you go to the restroom, you come back,
*  and you just know, this is gonna be great.
*  As long as I can fumble my way back to my mattress,
*  I'm gonna be asleep within another two minutes
*  going back to it.
*  Whereas for you, you probably wake up
*  and you feel pretty wide awake.
*  I would like to see what happens when we negate
*  that afternoon coffee on the frequency
*  and the duration of those middle of the night
*  awakenings for you.
*  Yeah, I'm definitely making the effort
*  to avoid caffeine intake in the afternoon.
*  And I think already starting to see
*  some of the positive benefits of doing that
*  as evidenced by the days that I consume caffeine
*  in the afternoon and experience the deficits.
*  It's a real thing.
*  And I believe you've about the numbers
*  on a different podcast previously,
*  talk a little bit about the metabolism of caffeine
*  and maybe even some of the variations that exist
*  between people in terms of the metabolic regulation
*  of caffeine.
*  So how long, let's say, drink a standard cup of coffee
*  or a couple of espresso and it has a,
*  gosh, I don't know, 150 milligrams of caffeine.
*  Is that 200?
*  Yeah, could be 150, 200.
*  Let's say 200 because certainly,
*  you know, a barista these days is gonna draw a beverage.
*  They're gonna overindex.
*  Yeah, so let's say 200 milligrams.
*  And somebody consumes that after lunch at 1 p.m.
*  and their bedtime is,
*  let's make them more conventional than I,
*  somewhere between 10 and 11 p.m.
*  Okay, so they're about nine to 10 hours out
*  from their bedtime.
*  They're having a nice, quote unquote,
*  nice strong cup of coffee after lunch.
*  What does that look like in terms of their biochemistry
*  and impact on sleep?
*  So caffeine has something that we call a half life
*  of about five to six hours,
*  meaning that after five to six hours,
*  about 50% of that caffeine is still circulating
*  in your bloodstream and thus your brain.
*  That means that caffeine has a quarter life
*  of somewhere between 10 to 12 hours.
*  Now this is on average and we'll come back to variations.
*  But think of it this way.
*  If you're taking a cup of coffee,
*  like you described there, at midday
*  and then you're going to bed at,
*  let's say, 11 or midnight,
*  that would be the equivalent,
*  based on what I've just told you,
*  the quarter life of getting yourself into bed
*  and just before you took yourself into bed,
*  you swig a quarter of a cup of coffee
*  and you hope for a good night of sleep
*  and the chances are that it may not happen.
*  Now again, that's a little bit sort of hyperbolic
*  as a statement, but just try to conceptualize it
*  in that way.
*  You would never think about taking on, you know,
*  a last quarter cup of coffee
*  just before you put your eye mask on.
*  No, but I have some friends
*  and somebody actually who works with the podcast team
*  and we'll go out to dinner as a team
*  when we're on the road and he'll order a big coffee
*  right after a 9 p.m. dinner.
*  And I'm like, can you sleep on this?
*  And he said, oh yeah, no problem.
*  And that no problem is in part this,
*  I don't have an issue with falling asleep,
*  but if we were to, based on the data,
*  map their electrical brain activity,
*  you would be able to see this reduction
*  in their deep non-REM sleep.
*  And it can reduce it if you look at the data
*  somewhere between 15 to 20%.
*  Now, for me to reduce your deep sleep by 15 to 20%,
*  I would probably have to age you by about 20 to 22 years,
*  or you could just do it every night
*  with a late night coffee, should you wish.
*  So again, and maybe we'll speak about this
*  in later episodes, I have changed my mind on caffeine.
*  I think morning caffeine use, or coffee, I should say,
*  being more specific, is fine
*  because I think there are health benefits
*  and we can go into in subsequent episodes
*  why coffee and the coffee bean itself
*  can provide those benefits.
*  So I've become a little bit more bullish on morning caffeine.
*  But evening caffeine, I just think it's,
*  the data is just not supportive.
*  Even if you are, and there are variations
*  and you were very astute in your question,
*  some people, I said on average,
*  caffeine has a half life of about five to six hours.
*  For some people, it's quicker,
*  and for other people, it's slower.
*  Why is that?
*  It's based on a gene and we know the gene.
*  It's a gene that is part of a set of liver enzymes,
*  and the gene is called the CYP1A2 gene.
*  And there are variations in that gene,
*  what we call polymorphisms,
*  and you can do these genetic tests
*  that you can buy these kits
*  and they will probably tell you which you are.
*  Are you sensitive or you're not sensitive?
*  You probably already know.
*  And so some people will not be as sensitive
*  and therefore they can have a more compressed timeframe
*  of a half life because it's moving out of their system
*  in a quicker manner.
*  So again, I'm not trying to be skirmongering.
*  I think you can have coffee in the morning
*  and you'll be just fine.
*  That late night coffee, I would like to see you
*  obviate that if you are someone who's doing it.
*  And the afternoon coffee sounds like a,
*  maybe only every once in a while
*  and try and make it mostly decaf or decaf
*  for that matter if it's really just for the taste.
*  Yeah, if it's just for the taste, go decaf.
*  If it's not, I understand that in some ways
*  what I'm talking about is the ideal world.
*  And drum roll, it turns out that most of us
*  don't live in that.
*  We live in this thing called the real world.
*  And so if you are facing a circumstance
*  where if you're under pressure at work
*  or if you're high performing athlete and this is it,
*  this is the event, it's all or nothing,
*  understand that you are going to sacrifice some sleep
*  at night but maybe that sacrifice is well worth it.
*  So again, I'm very open-minded.
*  I'm not trying to be simply too rigid
*  with this.
*  I want to take a brief break
*  and acknowledge our sponsor InsideTracker.
*  InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
*  that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
*  to help you better understand your body
*  and help you reach your health goals.
*  Now I've long been a believer
*  in getting regular blood work done.
*  For the simple reason that many of the factors
*  that impact your immediate and long-term health
*  can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.
*  The problem with a lot of blood tests out there however,
*  is that you get information back about metabolic factors,
*  hormones, et cetera, but you don't know what to do
*  with that information.
*  With InsideTracker, they make it very easy
*  to understand your results and they also point you
*  to specific directives that you can follow
*  in the realm of nutrition, exercise, supplementation,
*  even prescription drugs that can help bring the levels
*  back into the ranges that are optimal for you.
*  InsideTracker also offers InsideTracker Pro,
*  which enables coaches and health professionals
*  to provide premium and personalized services
*  by leveraging InsideTracker's analysis
*  and recommendations with their clients.

*  So you've talked about alcohol and its effects on sleep.
*  You've talked about caffeine and its effects on sleep.
*  And we talked about food and its effects on sleep.
*  What about THC and CBD?
*  Sometimes referred to more generally as cannabis.
*  And it's interesting, gosh, when I was growing up,
*  cannabis was illegal.
*  Nowadays, it's either legal or tolerated
*  or decriminalized in many places, not all.
*  But I would say there's been a tide shift
*  in terms of cannabis, meaning that many people
*  consume cannabis who are consuming it legally
*  and consume it for a lot of reasons
*  that other people consume alcohol
*  in a sedative effect, a slight hypnotic effect.
*  The actual definition of what these drugs do,
*  it goes by certain terms in the psychiatric literature,
*  of course, but in order to, quote unquote,
*  mellow out, to feel more relaxed, to reduce their anxiety.
*  It's far and away different than when I was growing up
*  where you would get into a lot of trouble
*  if you were caught smoking a joint
*  or taking a bong rip in the middle of the day.
*  And I realize most people aren't doing that at work.
*  I guess it depends on where you work.
*  But it, you know, edibles, tinctures,
*  I mean, the consumption of THC and CBD
*  is quite robust in a lot of places.
*  So with all the issues of legality
*  and the fact that people who, young people
*  should not be consuming them, even people 18 and younger,
*  not just for legal reasons,
*  but the brain is still developing,
*  what is the story with THC, CBD, cannabis,
*  edible, smoked, tinctures on sleep specifically?
*  It's very interesting if you look firstly
*  at the motivational reasons why people use cannabis.
*  Based on the published study,
*  somewhere in the top two reasons, sleep.
*  To fall and stay asleep.
*  To fall asleep and stay asleep.
*  Obviously, usually the principle first reason
*  is just to get high and have the experience
*  and the pleasure of being high,
*  if that's what sort of floats you.
*  It floats your train.
*  But certainly it's, you know, sleep,
*  and what we call a hypnotic to put you asleep
*  from the Greek derivative of the god for sleep.
*  That is high among the reasons that people will use.
*  We currently don't recommend it.
*  And here is why.
*  Certainly THC helps you fall asleep faster.
*  Very clear in the data.
*  The problem is that first you start to develop a tolerance
*  and to get that same sleep onset benefit,
*  you need to get, use I should say a higher dose.
*  So you start to develop dependency
*  and your dose regimen starts to increase.
*  The second issue with THC is that it's very good
*  at blocking your dream sleep, your REM sleep.
*  In fact, many people when they come and they tell me,
*  look, I was a heavy cannabis user,
*  even a light cannabis user for some time,
*  and then I stopped using.
*  And one of the strangest things happened to me,
*  I just started to have the most wild, vivid, crazy dreams.
*  I didn't know what was going on.
*  And it's a very simple explanation.
*  As you've been using, your brain has been compromised
*  in the amount of REM sleep it's been getting.
*  And you've been building up chronically a REM sleep debt.
*  And your brain is smart in the sense that it does try
*  to clock to some degree,
*  a counter of how much REM sleep you've lost.
*  And many people will say, yeah,
*  I don't really remember my dreams when I'm using.
*  But when they stop the brain finally,
*  because it's been cleansed of the thing
*  that's the roadblock to REM sleep,
*  not only did they go back to having the normal amount
*  of REM sleep that people would have, they have that,
*  plus they have what we call a REM sleep rebound,
*  which is even more and more intense REM sleep,
*  which leads to more intense dreaming.
*  So it's a very, I suspect there's a lot of people
*  who've had that experience listening
*  if they have been users and they've stopped.
*  So that's the second reason we don't advocate it.
*  The third reason is that when you stop using,
*  you also go through a very vicious
*  insomnia withdrawal syndrome, often many people will do.
*  Now that depends on how much you've been using,
*  for how long you've been using.
*  If you look at the data, and by the way,
*  part of the clinical diagnostic,
*  the psychiatric diagnostic description
*  of cannabis withdrawal is insomnia.
*  That's how reliable this insomnia problem is
*  when you come off cannabis.
*  And if you look at the data, one of the main reasons
*  that people relapse and start using cannabis again,
*  even though they don't want to,
*  is because they can't deal with the insomnia
*  that withdrawal has given them.
*  So you don't want to get into that vicious cycle.
*  Should you wish, again, it's your choice.
*  So THC, I think is not to be advised right now.
*  CBD is interesting.
*  I don't think there's enough data yet
*  for us to have a very strong opinion,
*  but I can at least offer mine.
*  The data so far is a little bit mixed
*  in what we call the effect size.
*  In other words, how reliable and how powerful
*  is the benefit of CBD on sleep,
*  but it does seem to have some benefit.
*  What's interesting is that it doesn't seem to have
*  the detriments that I just described for THC.
*  You've got to be looking at the data
*  a little bit careful with CBD.
*  It has what's called a U-shaped function to it,
*  which is that if you're taking too little,
*  and again, I really am so mindful of not trying to be,
*  okay, here are the numbers, but if you look at them,
*  I would say, you know, kind of cross your eyes,
*  squint your eyes, maybe less than 25 milligrams,
*  you run into the danger of CBD being wake promoting
*  rather than sleep promoting.
*  But once you get past, if you look ish,
*  50 milligrams and above,
*  then you start to go in the opposite direction
*  where it seems to be sleep promoting.
*  And I mention that just because,
*  at least here in the United States
*  and in many places in the world,
*  that industry is not regulated.
*  So it may say 50 milligrams on the bottle.
*  You don't really know.
*  Now some of those companies will have
*  what's called third party laboratory testing
*  where they'll send it out and you can scan a QRI code
*  and you can look at an independent laboratory
*  that tested it and show you the purity of it.
*  So that may be one way to go.
*  So CBD, I think has some favorable evidence right now.
*  If that's the case, let's just assume that you and I speak
*  in another five years time,
*  and there's really good data now for this.
*  What could be the mechanisms?
*  I think there's at least,
*  there's probably at least two, maybe three mechanisms.
*  The first is an indirect mechanism.
*  CBD has been demonstrated very nicely
*  in some fantastic studies to be an anxiolytic,
*  which is a fancy term for saying
*  it reduces down your anxiety.
*  And earlier you and I discussed that anxiety and stress
*  is one of the things that will keep you awake.
*  So indirectly it removes this kind of gate
*  that is preventing you from moving down
*  the royal road of sleep.
*  And it opens back up the gate
*  because it's removed that gate mechanism,
*  which is high anxiety.
*  And by way of being an anxiolytic,
*  it's softened that anxiety and it's easier for you
*  to fall asleep.
*  I think that's probably the principle,
*  mechanistic bet I would have right now.
*  Another indirect mechanism.
*  If you look at some of the studies in rats,
*  and we do human work at my sleep center,
*  so we don't do animal studies,
*  but if you look at the data in the rats,
*  CBD can be hypothermic,
*  which means that it drops your core body temperature.
*  And just as we spoke about earlier in this episode,
*  you need to drop your body temperature to get to sleep.
*  So I think that's the second reason.
*  I think the third reason is that it could have
*  a direct sleep promoting mechanism.
*  I think it's unclear right now exactly how it's interacting
*  with the sleep machinery of the brain.
*  We've got some hypotheses.
*  The danger is again,
*  it's just not a well-regulated substance.
*  So I am actually just full disclosure,
*  I'm working with a company in the United Kingdom
*  in collaboration with King's College
*  and the Institute of Psychiatry there
*  to see if we can create an analog,
*  a clean analog of CBD.
*  But I think the potential upside of it,
*  not just for sleep,
*  but for a number of different psychiatric conditions
*  like anxiety could be beneficial.
*  So I would say that that's right now
*  the sort of the skinny on THC and CBD.
*  Okay, so just to make sure that I have the basic list
*  of sleep hygiene factors, correct?
*  I have regularity is king.
*  Yep.
*  Light and dark, meaning that one should optimize
*  or at least seek to optimize their exposure to light
*  in the morning and throughout the day
*  and then in the evening to make things dim and dark.
*  Yes.
*  Temperature and there you have a,
*  it's not a mantra, but what is it?
*  It's a warm up to cool down to fall asleep
*  and then it's stay cool, like Fonzie,
*  stay cool to stay asleep and then a warm up to wake up.
*  Yep, and we will come onto that
*  I think in a little while again.
*  Then there's walk it out,
*  which is if I understand correctly,
*  if you're trying to fall asleep or fall back asleep
*  and it's taking you longer than about 20, 25 minutes,
*  you should just get out of bed
*  and go elsewhere in the house, do something else,
*  maybe even lie down on a different surface in the house
*  to try and see if you can sleep there,
*  but don't stay in bed, don't create a paired association
*  of wakefulness and your bed
*  because that can lead to problems in subsequent nights.
*  Yeah, and I would only say that try to resist if you can,
*  if you really want your bedroom to be the place
*  where you now become consistently asleep,
*  try not to start sleeping in some of the location
*  consistently because then all of a sudden
*  you bond that with good sleep
*  and you unbuckle this notion that we're trying to relearn,
*  which is know your bedroom is the place of sleep.
*  So it's fine to go elsewhere, try to stay awake
*  and force yourself to stay awake
*  until you are absolutely sleepy, then go back to bed.
*  Okay, and then we discussed alcohol, food, caffeine
*  and THC slash CBD, AKA cannabis.
*  And with respect to alcohol,
*  it's clear that none is best if you're going to have some,
*  you don't wanna drink too early in the day,
*  but you don't wanna drink too much or too close to bedtime
*  because it can disrupt rapid eye movement sleep.
*  Food seems that creating some sort of buffer
*  between your last bite of food and your to bedtime
*  by somewhere between maybe two, three hours,
*  but for some people it'll be more like 90 minutes.
*  And of course that's going to depend
*  on the size of the meal, et cetera,
*  but eating a big meal and then going straight to bed,
*  probably not a good idea.
*  Caffeine has this long half life.
*  So if you're going to indulge, which I do,
*  do so early in the day, beware the afternoon caffeine.
*  Yeah, do the Huberman taper
*  is what I'm gonna call it right now,
*  which is not an interpretive dance,
*  it's simply the caffeine taper.
*  And then THC CBD does nothing good
*  for your sleep architecture,
*  although some people have the impression
*  that it is good for their sleep
*  because it makes it easier for them to fall asleep.
*  But what they are unaware of is that it is disrupting
*  the quality and architecture of the different stages
*  of sleep in ways that are not serving people well.
*  That seems to be the case for THC.
*  And I think CBD has promise
*  and research must try harder, including my own.
*  And you very kindly emphasize
*  that you're not telling people what to do,
*  they just should know what they're doing
*  so that they can make changes if they so choose.
*  That's right.
*  I would always say that I'm not trained
*  to be a medical doctor.
*  Any advice that I give is simply
*  scientifically descriptive advice.
*  It's not medically prescriptive
*  nor lifestyle prescriptive advice.
*  I'm smiling because what I always say is
*  I'm a scientist, not a physician.
*  So I don't prescribe anything,
*  but I profess lots of things.
*  Or as my good friend who's a musician,
*  Tim Armstrong says, I'm not a cop.
*  That's right.
*  So do what you want.
*  Okay.
*  What a wonderful list to leap off into the unconventional
*  and more advanced tools for sleep enhancement.
*  So let's go there.
*  So I think many people may have heard
*  of some of the conventional,
*  but what about the unconventional?
*  I would probably offer five or six.
*  The first one I would say is that
*  if you are struggling with sleep
*  and you have had a bad night of sleep,
*  the first recommendation is do nothing.
*  And what I mean by that is
*  if you've had a bad night of sleep,
*  you're awake for three hours,
*  do not sleep in any later into the morning.
*  Do not go to bed any earlier.
*  Do not increase your caffeine intake to try to offset it
*  and do not nap during the day.
*  Why am I telling you those things?
*  If you wake up later that following morning,
*  your Adenosine clock that we spoke about,
*  this building up of sleepiness that happens when we wake up
*  is going to start later in the day.
*  So when it comes time for you to fall asleep
*  at what would then be the next night at your normal time,
*  you're not going to feel as sleepy.
*  Why?
*  Because you woke up that much later
*  and you're setting yourself up for failure again.
*  Equally, don't go to bed any earlier.
*  If you have become accustomed and your brain has
*  and your circadian clock has become accustomed
*  to going to bed at a certain time
*  and hopefully you're doing it regularly,
*  then getting into bed two or three hours early
*  has the danger, it's not a certainty,
*  but a danger of you then getting into bed and thinking,
*  well, I know I had a bad night of sleep last night,
*  but I still can't fall asleep straight away.
*  So now you're spending another 90 minutes in bed
*  at the beginning because you've gone to bed
*  90 minutes earlier thinking it's a good idea to compensate.
*  Don't do that either.
*  Hold out even if you do feel tired.
*  My recommendation would be after that bad night of sleep,
*  hold out for as long as you can,
*  as close to your natural bedtime as possible,
*  then go to sleep and you will give yourself
*  highest chance of success.
*  Don't overcaffeinate, that's the obvious one.
*  Follow the beautiful Huberman taper
*  and then obviously try not to compensate with a nap.
*  Why?
*  Because that nap, as happens when we sleep,
*  is going to remove some of that sleepiness,
*  that adenosine, and once again, you get into bed
*  and you're not as sleepy as you would naturally be.
*  So you again go through a bad night
*  because you're struggling to sleep or you wake up
*  and you can't get back because you've got less weight
*  of sleepiness on your shoulders
*  due to the nap that happened earlier.
*  So I know it's hard, but I would say
*  when the alarm goes off after a bad night,
*  you just think, I do not want to get up.
*  It's been such a rough night.
*  I know it's a short-term gain,
*  but trust me, it's a long-term loss
*  because you're going to then just get
*  into this vicious cycle.
*  So that's the first unconventional tip.
*  Can I just pause you for a second?
*  I'm a little wide-eyed over here
*  because I did not know any of that.
*  Typically if I get a poor night's sleep,
*  I'll do whatever I can to recover that sleep.
*  Take a nap, I'll adjust to bedtime the next evening.
*  So I hope everyone is paying careful attention
*  to what Matt just said.
*  I mean, that's a important list
*  because I think one of the very common things
*  is for people to just not get a great night's sleep.
*  And I think most people think,
*  okay, I'll drink a little more caffeine.
*  I will go to bed a little earlier tonight,
*  maybe catching a nap in the afternoon, this kind of thing.
*  And I would have thought that too
*  and maybe even suggested that.
*  And if you listen to the first episode
*  and where I list in a doomsday manner
*  the things that can happen by way of a short night,
*  you would think that that's what I would then recommend.
*  But it was really imprinted on me
*  by a wonderful sleep clinician, Michael Perlis,
*  who sort of described some of these features
*  and exactly the reasons sort of underlying them.
*  And I think I've just tried to bake that out
*  into a formula that makes sense.
*  Again, it's not about the rule, it's about explaining it
*  because when you explain it,
*  at first it sounds contradictory and paradoxical.
*  When you understand it,
*  it hopefully sounds logical and actionable.
*  So that would be the first suggestion.
*  Could I just, sorry to interrupt again.
*  My audience hates when I interrupt,
*  but I'm doing it on their behalf.
*  Oh, I love it.
*  Because I like to think that there's some value
*  in some of at least what you say in response.
*  I saw a really terrific post from Dr. Rhonda Patrick,
*  who we both know and admire for her public education,
*  public health education work.
*  And she described a study whereby if people are,
*  I think it was slightly sleep deprived,
*  maybe by a few hours,
*  that some of the disruption
*  to morning blood glucose regulation
*  that is known to accompany partial sleep deprivation
*  and certainly complete sleep deprivation,
*  but in this case, partial sleep deprivation
*  could be offset by still exercising in the morning.
*  That's right.
*  Which frankly, I have to say,
*  if I haven't slept that well,
*  then normally I'm like,
*  maybe today's the day I don't exercise.
*  But now having heard that information,
*  I make it a point to still exercise,
*  sometimes with a little bit less intensity,
*  because I don't want to be completely exhausted
*  in the afternoon and go to sleep at 4 p.m. or something,
*  really disrupt my schedule.
*  But I thought that was really interesting
*  because it's a sort of partial inoculation
*  of the blood glucose disruption caused by sleep deprivation.
*  I'm so glad you brought it up.
*  It's a fantastic study.
*  And I, Rhonda, and I think you've tried to discuss it
*  some years ago on a show,
*  but I like it because it does offer some degree
*  of actionable hope and a strategy.
*  Blood sugar, absolutely critical.
*  It is very sensitive to sleep.
*  When you don't get enough,
*  it goes in bad directions.
*  You used a very specific word, cleverly so.
*  That word was partially.
*  At first you hear or read that study,
*  and Rhonda was never suggesting this to you,
*  I'm not saying that.
*  You think, well, if it offsets blood sugar,
*  and the study was saying exercise can nullify a lack of sleep,
*  you conflate that single outcome benefit
*  with the idea that, well, but maybe it doesn't actually,
*  does it compensate for the deficits in immune function
*  or cardiovascular disease concerns,
*  or my hormonal health, or my learning and memory,
*  or my emotional and brain health?
*  Maybe it does, but maybe it doesn't.
*  So I think I would always just caution people to saying,
*  when you hear a study like that, it's very natural to think,
*  oh, that must mean that it translates
*  to everything else in my body
*  and everything else in my brain.
*  It may, but it also may not be.
*  Terrific, so if you don't sleep that well,
*  do your best to still get some exercise,
*  but just be mindful of the fact that,
*  in the winter months especially,
*  that might, if you go too hard in the gym or on a run,
*  you might be a little bit immune compromised.
*  Just be mindful of the fact that you're a more vulnerable
*  being when you're sleep deprived,
*  but that exercise can help adjust things
*  in the right direction.
*  And if it's early in the day,
*  presumably that's not going to disrupt the proper bedtime.
*  And if it's later in the day,
*  I suppose as long as you don't need caffeine
*  in order to do that exercise,
*  and or if you're familiar with exercising later in the day,
*  fine, I find if I exercise,
*  I'm not one of these people that can go for a run
*  seven o'clock at night and then just shower and go to sleep.
*  Because you're a morning type.
*  Because I'm a morning type, other people can.
*  Okay, we'll get into exercise a bit more
*  in a later episode. We should do.
*  We'll be sure to do that,
*  but nonetheless, I just raised that now.
*  So what are some of the other
*  unconventional protocols for sleep?
*  So I think other suggestions I would have after do nothing
*  would be try to think about limiting your time in bed.
*  If you are struggling with sleep,
*  this is something that is used in the,
*  probably the most well validated
*  psychological intervention for insomnia.
*  And it's called cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia
*  or CBT-I for short.
*  What happens is that you work with a clinician,
*  they interview you, they assess all of the reasons
*  that you may not be sleeping.
*  And then they create from the toolbox
*  of many different options,
*  a bespoke tailored sort of Savile Row Soup prescription
*  for you, for your treatment.
*  If you look at the studies of that collection
*  of different tools in the CBT-I box
*  for intervention of insomnia,
*  and you ask of all of those,
*  which seems to carry the greatest impact on insomnia,
*  which has the greatest sort of gravitas.
*  It seems to be this thing that we call bedtime rescheduling.
*  It used to be known as sleep restriction therapy,
*  but obviously if you come to me and you say,
*  look, I'm not sleeping very well, I've got insomnia.
*  I say, I understand and I've got a treatment for you.
*  It's called sleep restriction therapy.
*  And you say, no, no, no, you didn't understand.
*  I'm not getting enough sleep.
*  But it's not quite that.
*  Here's how it works.
*  If you are spending so much time in bed,
*  too much time in bed,
*  you are not forcing your brain to be efficient.
*  And by way of constraining your sleep window,
*  even to let's say five hours a night to begin with,
*  I brute force ruthless efficiency
*  from your sleeping brain after several days.
*  So another analogy would be,
*  let's say you're trying to make a nice thin crust
*  of pizza base and you put the dough on the table
*  and you start rolling it out.
*  If you roll it too thin,
*  it starts to get gaps and holes in it.
*  Why?
*  Because you've spread it out too far
*  and you've started to create these absences.
*  That's the same thing that happens.
*  And it's very natural as an insomnia patient,
*  you would say, I'm just not getting enough sleep.
*  So I'm going to start spending more time in bed.
*  It's the very worst idea.
*  Another way would be to say,
*  I go to the gym and I spend about an hour
*  and a half working out.
*  But if I were to videotape you,
*  a lot of people are doing the,
*  I think I've coined it as your phrase,
*  but the 11th rep where people do the 10 reps
*  and then all of a sudden there's the selfie
*  or there's the social media.
*  Oh yeah, the texting, they finish the last rep,
*  put it down and then it really leads to their phone.
*  And if you look, they're only working out for about,
*  let's say 45 minutes and the other is wasted.
*  So what if the next day you came to the gym
*  and I said, look, I'm sorry,
*  and there's some big bouncer guys at the door.
*  You are only allowed to work out for 40 minutes
*  and then we're going to eject you.
*  And the first day you go back and you do the same thing.
*  You've only got through 30% of your workout.
*  So you get booted, the next day you come back
*  and you do a little bit more and you get booted again.
*  After about five or six days,
*  you've built up such a strong desire
*  and hunger to get your workout in.
*  You walk in, you put your phone on silent,
*  you put it over in the corner and you just get to it.
*  And that's the same thing that we're trying to do
*  with sleep restriction therapy.
*  So you have to be a little bit careful,
*  do it under supervision, especially if you're driving
*  or you're operating heavy machinery.
*  We just want to keep an eye.
*  It's not necessarily a big concern, but we would say,
*  okay, Andrew, you're currently spending almost total
*  about eight-ish or seven and a half hours in bed.
*  Tonight, I'm going to restrict you down to five hours a night
*  and we're going to do this for the next week.
*  And the way that we normally do it
*  is I don't change your wake up time,
*  I change your to bedtime.
*  Why?
*  It's easier to stay awake longer than it is to wake up earlier.
*  So I put it on the front end of the compromise
*  and at first things don't change,
*  but after maybe about four or five days
*  of going through this,
*  I build up enough of a short term debt in your system
*  that your system all of a sudden thinks,
*  gosh, I just cannot be as lazy anymore.
*  I can't do this thing of waking up in the middle
*  of the night and spending an hour and a half awake.
*  I don't have the choice anymore.
*  There's so much physiological buildup
*  and pressure to do this.
*  And gradually what happens is that you sleep longer,
*  you don't wake up as much.
*  And after maybe about two weeks of doing this,
*  all of a sudden you go to bed at this later time.
*  So for you, let's say you normally go to bed at eight,
*  I'm going to have you go to bed at maybe 10, 30, 11,
*  but we're still going to have you wake up
*  at that sort of 4.30 a.m. mark
*  that you would normally wake up.
*  And all of a sudden you go to bed at 10, 30, 11,
*  you're out like a light.
*  And then again, the next thing you remember
*  is your alarm going off saying,
*  I'm sorry, you've got to wake up.
*  And what happens by way of that reset
*  is gradually we will then, once you're stable,
*  we will start to back it off.
*  We'll start to have you go to bed at 10.
*  And if it stays stable, then 9.45, then 9.30,
*  and titrate you back to where you were.
*  And if there's any sign that you're starting
*  to not sleep well, we zip it back up again.
*  The goal here is in some ways almost like hitting
*  the reset button on your WiFi router.
*  I'm trying to retrain your brain to better sleep.
*  Because when you are not sleeping well,
*  you've lost your confidence in your ability to sleep.
*  And when I do this technique with you,
*  gradually your system and you cognitively relearn
*  that you are a good sleeper and you can trust in sleep.
*  And now your sleep does not control you.
*  You control your sleep.
*  The hard part, however, is that it's not easy to go through.
*  And we have to be, we have to usually ask two questions
*  with individuals.
*  Firstly, what is your motivation for better sleep?
*  We need to know that you really are motivated.
*  And then second, you just stay with a high touch
*  white glove frequency, checking in on individuals
*  and motivating them to keep going
*  because it's very easy to fall off the wagon.
*  So that's the next suggestion, sleep restriction therapy
*  or bedtime rescheduling as we would call it.
*  You said it's difficult for people to go through.
*  It takes a little bit of rigor, a little bit of attention,
*  means in some cases getting less sleep than one would like.
*  But as compared to something that sadly I've experienced
*  a lot in my life of having challenges with sleep
*  and trying to get things back in order
*  and looking at the bed and just going,
*  oh my God, battleground, you know, battleground.
*  It's, I think it makes a lot of sense.
*  And I love the analogy to the gym.
*  Somehow if there's a restriction to one hour
*  in and out the door, or maybe 70 minutes in and out the door
*  because you need to put your stuff in a locker
*  or something like that, it always, at least for me,
*  it gets done best when you just have those constraints.
*  I think there's something about the human brain
*  that we don't do well in unrestrained systems.
*  I really think guardrails are fantastic.
*  I love deadlines, for instance.
*  Yeah, discipline is essentially the-
*  Yeah, hard deadlines.
*  Or as they say in academia,
*  because we write grants all the time, drop deadlines.
*  Who made up that term?
*  But if you don't make it, that's it.
*  It's like, there isn't a, hey, I'll send this in tomorrow.
*  5 p.m. Pacific time, that website closes
*  and you better have-
*  And boy do you get things done all of a sudden.
*  It's amazing.
*  It's surprising how much distraction you can pull out
*  the noise and focus on the signal.
*  It's great signal to noise ratio.
*  Yeah, and I love the idea that one can control their sleep
*  as opposed to sleep controlling them.
*  I think that that's, and this notion of sleep confidence,
*  one's confidence in their ability to sleep.
*  These are important terms and they're more than just terms
*  because I think that a field and an area of health practice
*  and gosh, what's more important than sleep?
*  It's the foundation of mental health, physical health
*  and performance, period.
*  Really thrives on a common nomenclature
*  and I really appreciate that you're peppering
*  these episodes with new nomenclature
*  that captures a lot of the essence of the protocols
*  and the mechanisms.
*  So there, that's my editorial.
*  Please continue.
*  I would say that in terms of other things,
*  maybe just to go through them a little more quickly,
*  we've spoken some about a wind down routine.
*  Most people under appreciate the importance
*  of a wind down routine.
*  We often think that sleep is like a light bulb,
*  that we dive into bed, we switch off the light bulb
*  and sleep should appear just as quickly.
*  It's untrue.
*  Sleep in terms of a process is much more physiologically
*  like trying to land a plane.
*  It just takes time to come down onto the terra firma
*  of good sleep at night.
*  Whatever it is you enjoy as a relaxation method,
*  engage in it.
*  Could be listening to a podcast, could be reading a book,
*  maybe it's a meditation, it's light stretching,
*  maybe whatever it is that you do,
*  just build it in to your regimen.
*  You would never be driving down the road
*  and then pull into your garage
*  at the same 40 mile an hour speed.
*  You gradually decelerate and you come to a stop.
*  It's the same thing with sleep.
*  So you need to find some way to decelerate
*  and we've spoken about methods already as to how to do that.
*  The next tip is a little quirky and funny.
*  Do not count sheep.
*  There's a great study from my colleague,
*  Dr. Alison Harvey at UC Berkeley
*  and she put this to the test.
*  Didn't make people fall asleep faster.
*  It made them take longer to fall asleep.
*  However, she did find an alternative.
*  If you are not into meditation or podcasts or sleep stories
*  or whatever it is that you wish for,
*  try taking yourself on a mental walk
*  and it has to be a walk that you know very well.
*  So let's say that you walk your dog every day
*  and you know there's a couple of walks
*  that you take with your dog.
*  Do it in hyper detail.
*  So close your eyes, you go to the front door,
*  you clip in the dog to the leash, you walk out,
*  you go down the steps, out to the driveway,
*  then you take a right, but you always cross over
*  and you look to the left and the right
*  because that's the place where traffic always comes.
*  You cross over and now you're walking up
*  and there's that strange sort of set of garbage
*  that's been outside of the house for a long time
*  and you don't know why it hasn't been cleared
*  and then you move.
*  That type of high fidelity detail
*  allows you to do what we said earlier,
*  which is get your mind off itself.
*  And when you do that, again, typically,
*  you fall asleep faster and that's what she found.
*  It was a great, great study.
*  I really enjoyed that.
*  I'm curious as to why it works so well
*  and I'm not challenging that it works.
*  I can imagine, having just closed my eyes
*  and kind of imagine what that would be like.
*  It's very pleasant.
*  There might be, and here I'm just speculating something
*  about engaging one's procedural memory
*  because that's procedural memory.
*  You're trying to remember how you do something
*  as opposed to declarative memory, which is about facts.
*  I remember this and this is gonna happen tomorrow.
*  I wonder whether or not there's something
*  about using a procedural memory
*  as opposed to a declarative memory visualization.
*  Somebody should do that study.
*  They should and I think it's certainly possible
*  that when you're incorporating some aspects
*  of the scene and the information is more sort of veridical
*  and maybe sort of episodic declarative memory.
*  But when you're taking yourself from a mental walk,
*  what is the fundamental premise of that?
*  It's a walk, it's motion, it's procedural memory.
*  And so maybe it's something to do about
*  with being more attentive to becoming embodied
*  because when you're out walking and you're moving,
*  it is a more embodied experience
*  than just sitting there at your desk,
*  which is mostly your head and very little your body.
*  So I think it's an intriguing idea.
*  And I think another tip that I now think of,
*  which also comes from the work of Dr. Alison Harvey,
*  when individuals come up to me after sort of public events
*  or they see me at the airport,
*  they'll say, look, every night for some strange reason,
*  at 2.45 a.m. I wake up and it happens
*  three or four nights a week.
*  My first question to them is, how do you know it's 2.45?
*  And they say, well, I look at the clock
*  or I look at my phone.
*  Best piece of advice next,
*  remove all clock faces from the bedroom.
*  No matter how bad your sleep is going to be that night,
*  knowing what time it is,
*  is only going to make matters worse.
*  It is not going to make matters any better.
*  And that can create an anxiety trigger that you think,
*  it's 2.45 and then you're tossing and turning,
*  you look back at the clock and now it's 3.14 a.m.
*  And you think, I've got to be awake at six,
*  I've got a big meeting and now it's 5.25.
*  Don't do that to yourself.
*  And I, even though I don't typically struggle with sleep,
*  I have no clock faces in my bedroom.
*  The phone that I use to help do the guided meditation
*  is an old phone and it has only Wi-Fi connectivity
*  and nothing else on it.
*  And I will only hit play and then I will never turn it around.
*  I will not look at the clock face, just doesn't help me.
*  Another incentive for keeping the phone out of the room,
*  if one can.
*  I understand there are reasons when one would want
*  the phone in the room if it's potentially signaling
*  an emergency.
*  Well, I think it's a very important point
*  and we've done some work in this area too.
*  What that phone does is create a low level of anxiety.
*  It's what we call anticipatory anxiety.
*  One of the mechanisms separate from that,
*  well, it's related to that.
*  If you look at teen phone use,
*  one of the reasons that they don't sleep very well at night
*  is that they're constantly checking their phones
*  because of FOMO, a fear of missing out.
*  What has gone on as I've been asleep?
*  And it's stunning the data, but for most adults,
*  the other reason I don't like advocating for phone use,
*  when your alarm goes off in the morning,
*  what is the first thing that you do as you're in bed?
*  You swipe right or you unlock your phone
*  and you instantly start checking social media,
*  emails, text messages, and this tsunami of stress
*  and anxiety just floods over you.
*  It hits you like this wall of anxiety.
*  And I bring this up because it again trains your brain
*  for expectation of that.
*  Anticipatory anxiety has a consequence on your sleep
*  and everyone knows this.
*  Let's say that you've booked an early morning flight
*  and you've got to wake up at 5 a.m.
*  when normally you wake up at 7 a.m.
*  Two things will usually happen.
*  First, you know that you're just not going to sleep
*  as deeply that night because you're on edge
*  and this is for an interview or it's for a critical,
*  this is a non-negotiable trip that has to happen.
*  You've got to wake up.
*  The second thing is that when you are expecting
*  that wave of sort of a need to wake up
*  and maybe it's just I'm expecting the phone again,
*  you will wake up just a few minutes before your alarm.
*  It's stunning how many people will say,
*  I had this big flight the next day,
*  and you almost know I'm going to wake up two minutes
*  before my alarm goes off.
*  Why?
*  Because your brain has stayed in this shallow state
*  of anticipatory anxiety and you don't get as much deep sleep
*  and we've now demonstrated that when you have
*  that low level of anxiety, the depth of your deep sleep
*  is not as deep, you don't get the good.
*  So again, not to be trying to dictate what people do,
*  just be aware that when you do create that behavior
*  and that regimen, it becomes almost like a knee-jerk
*  sort of trained habitual response.
*  Terrific.
*  Let's talk about some of the advanced tools
*  for sleep enhancement.
*  What sorts of methods could one incorporate?
*  What are some of the data?
*  And is there any way that we can sort of lump these into
*  sort of some framework or categories?
*  Because I know there are a lot of different tools.
*  There are and I suppose this would be,
*  I know our friend Peter Tira
*  has spoken about medicine 3.0.
*  I think this would probably be sleep optimization 3.0.
*  What is coming down the pike?
*  What is in the research?
*  And I think, you know, could make it to market
*  or has made it to market,
*  but yet we're still right on the cusp.
*  We've seen we again in the Royal We
*  have been able to augment human sleep
*  in at least four different ways.
*  There are methods for electrical brain stimulation.
*  There are methods for acoustic stimulation of sleep.
*  So electrical stimulation of sleep,
*  acoustic stimulation of sleep,
*  thermal manipulation of sleep,
*  and then finally kinesthetic manipulation of sleep,
*  meaning movement-based stimulation.
*  And maybe I can just go into each one of those.
*  The electrical stimulation is probably the most well rendered
*  of all of those four.
*  In part because we started there and we,
*  and here it's not the Royal We,
*  we have done a lot of work on this.
*  And I can tell you a little bit about a company
*  emerging from that.
*  But when you're trying to manipulate the human brain,
*  the principle currency in which the brain communicates
*  is electricity.
*  Now there are lots of things that help it do that,
*  such as chemicals,
*  but the principle language and verbiage of the brain
*  is electricity.
*  So if you're going to manipulate the brain,
*  why don't you speak in its currency of electricity?
*  So we and others have developed a method
*  based on something called direct current brain stimulation,
*  and specifically something called
*  transcranial direct current stimulation.
*  And I'll unpack that.
*  Trans meaning movement.
*  So if you've heard of transport,
*  it's about moving things from one port to another.
*  Transatlantic, moving across the Atlantic.
*  So here the start of it is moving.
*  You're moving something from one place to the next.
*  Transcranial means through your skull.
*  So we're moving something through your skull.
*  Transcranial direct current is the type of voltage
*  or the type of electrical impulse that we're putting in.
*  It could be alternating current,
*  or it could be direct current.
*  And early methods and those we use
*  have been direct current.
*  So transcranial direct current, and then stimulation.
*  We're trying to stimulate the brain,
*  specifically the cortex.
*  And the way that we do this is that we apply
*  electrode pads to your head,
*  and we insert a small amount of voltage into your brain.
*  Now, it's so small that you typically don't feel it,
*  but it has a measurable impact
*  on that electrical brain activity.
*  So very early on, scientists,
*  and we weren't the first to do this by any means,
*  there was a great paper, now famous paper in my field,
*  by wonderful scientist Jan Born in Germany.
*  And they took a group of subjects,
*  and they applied these electrode pads
*  and specifically to the front of the brain.
*  And I'll explain why we target the front of the brain
*  with sleep electrical enhancement,
*  or the electroceutical as it were.
*  They applied these electrode pads
*  to two groups of participants,
*  and then they let them go into sleep.
*  And as you'll remember, we described that
*  in the first two or three hours of sleep
*  is when you get most of your deep sleep.
*  And they were targeting those deep, slow brain waves
*  that we spoke about, those big, slow, powerful waves
*  that define deep sleep.
*  And what they did in one of those groups,
*  the other group was the placebo group,
*  they still had the electrodes applied,
*  they still went to sleep.
*  In the stimulation group, they waited
*  until those individuals went into deep sleep.
*  And I told you in the first episode
*  that those deep sleep brain waves
*  were going up and down very, very slowly,
*  maybe just once or twice a second.
*  So they started to stimulate the brain,
*  inputting these stimulation pulses at a very slow rhythm,
*  trying to match the rhythm of the brain.
*  In fact, they were less than one hertz,
*  less than one cycle per second in terms of a pulse.
*  It's almost as though we're trying to act
*  like a choir to a flagging lead vocalist.
*  And as these brain waves are going up and down,
*  you're trying to sing in time
*  with those deep sleep brain waves.
*  And in doing so, you're trying to boost
*  and amplify the size of those deep sleep brain waves.
*  Now, to begin with, they just waited
*  until they went into deep sleep,
*  and they started to stimulate at that frequency.
*  And I'll come back to why that's important in a second.
*  But sure enough, what they demonstrated,
*  they were able to boost the electrical quality
*  of that deep sleep by about 60%.
*  And they were also able to almost double
*  the amount of memory benefit that sleep provided.
*  Which is very impressive.
*  That is impressive.
*  Now, I should note that there was more recently
*  a replication attempt of that paper,
*  and they did a very good job.
*  They really did it to the letter,
*  and they weren't able to replicate the effects as powerfully.
*  However, subsequent studies have now taken
*  a more nuanced approach,
*  and it's the one that we've taken too.
*  And it's called closed loop stimulation.
*  Closed loop here simply means that I'm not going
*  to just wait until you go into deep sleep,
*  and then just take a chance and start stimulating your brain,
*  not knowing of the synchrony of my pulses into your brain
*  relative to the brain waves that you're experiencing.
*  Closed loop does do that.
*  So what I'm doing is I'm measuring the electrical brain waves
*  that are occurring, and because they're nice and slow,
*  they're very predictable.
*  And I can program my algorithm
*  and my brain stimulation machine to say,
*  I'm going to wait and wait,
*  and as soon as you are on this peak of your slow wave,
*  it turns out to be the negative trough, but I'll forego that,
*  we then try to strike at that point of midnight
*  when you're going through the biggest powerful dip
*  in the brain wave, and we're trying to enhance it.
*  And same with the peak.
*  So this is where we get a stimulus from the brain,
*  your electrical brain activity,
*  and then we create a timed response.
*  So it's a stimulus response.
*  It's a call and response loop.
*  And by way of doing that,
*  it's a much smarter specific method
*  than a more generalized, I'm just going to stimulate
*  and hope I catch those waves at the peaks.
*  The reason is important because different people
*  have different speeds of their slow brain waves.
*  They're all slow, but your speed of brain wave
*  may be a little bit different to mine.
*  And if I'm off with my stimulation by,
*  let's say just half a second or a quarter of a second,
*  time and time again, I may be leaving some benefit
*  on the table, but closed loop stimulation
*  creates this personalized electrical prescription
*  of stimulation.
*  And when you do that, you get very reliable benefits.
*  You can boost those deep slow brain waves.
*  You get the memory benefits, but also what we found
*  is you not only boost those deep sleep brain waves,
*  you boost another electrical signature
*  that I spoke about in the first episode
*  called sleep spindles.
*  And it seems to be the combination of those two things
*  by way of electrical stimulation
*  that provides the benefits.
*  Now, I should note, I haven't mentioned this before,
*  you can buy these devices on the internet DIY style.
*  Do not do that.
*  If you go onto the internet too,
*  you can also find some horror stories.
*  People have misappropriated the voltage.
*  They've got skin burns.
*  They've lost their eyesight for several weeks.
*  Do not do this at home.
*  I promise you, wait until these products come out.
*  And that's one of the reasons why we've scaled it
*  into a company and we're trying to do this.
*  And we've got a long way to go yet,
*  huge number of trials that we have to do
*  before I feel ready to really lay it on the table
*  and say, you should absolutely buy this.
*  It's well worth it.
*  But we're getting very, very close, I would say.
*  Great.
*  What about thermal manipulations, temperature?
*  I mean, there's such a tight relationship
*  between temperature and sleep
*  and wakefulness for that matter.
*  What sort of technologies, tools, protocols exist
*  that use thermal manipulation as a way to augment sleep?
*  I love this topic because there are hi-fi, low-fi
*  and no-fly technologies that you can use.
*  The story of sleep and temperature,
*  as you mentioned before and reiterated,
*  in terms of the three-part standard,
*  that TERSET that I would describe is,
*  again, you need to warm up to cool down to fall asleep.
*  You need to stay cool to stay asleep.
*  You need to warm up to wake up.
*  What that refers to, technically, in sleep science
*  are what we call the thermal trigger zones.
*  So warming up to cool down to fall asleep
*  is what we call the sleep onset thermal trigger zone.
*  Cooling down or staying cool to stay asleep
*  is about the deep sleep trigger zone.
*  And then warming up to wake up
*  is the activating alertness trigger zone.
*  Studies, if you looked at them to begin with
*  before they manipulated that, found something fascinating.
*  If I take you, Andrew Huberman,
*  and I bring you into my lab,
*  and I remove your phone, all your laptop,
*  and you say goodbye to your friends and family,
*  and I bring you into the center,
*  and there are no cues as to what time of day.
*  No windows, no nothing.
*  And I'm just going to say, look, I'll keep asking you,
*  but at the moment that you feel most sleepy,
*  just let me know.
*  It turns out that before that,
*  we'd done the delightful intervention
*  of inserting a rectal probe into you,
*  because that's the best way
*  that we can measure your core body temperature.
*  So we're measuring your core body temperature,
*  and sure enough, despite you knowing nothing
*  about what time it is,
*  the moment that you will tell me I am ready to go to bed
*  and I am sleepy is the moment when you are
*  on the greatest decelerating trajectory
*  of your core body temperature.
*  It is highly predictive of how sleepy you will feel.
*  The way that your body does this is by pushing blood
*  out to the surface regions of your skin,
*  notably your hands and your feet,
*  because these are these highly vascular regions,
*  and you had a great podcast from one of my heroes
*  and good friend, Craig Heller,
*  who's done some amazing work on this at Stanford.
*  So naturally, as we lie down,
*  blood races to our hands and our feet,
*  and also our head,
*  and we start to release that heat trapped
*  in the core of our body,
*  and by releasing that heat at the surface,
*  our core body temperature drops.
*  Hence, the outer surfaces of you, hands, feet, and face,
*  have to warm up for your core to cool down
*  for you to fall asleep.
*  And in fact, there was a great Nature paper some years ago,
*  they just measured the temperature of someone's feet,
*  and they looked at how quickly they fell asleep,
*  and when they fell asleep,
*  sure enough, the warmer your feet,
*  the faster you fell asleep.
*  Why?
*  Because the warmness reflects the blood dilation
*  and the pumping out of the blood to the periphery.
*  And then they did it in rats,
*  where they started to warm the pores of the rats,
*  and the rats fell asleep more quickly.
*  I love this notion of, again, we don't do anamorphic,
*  you know, I love the notion of wrapping
*  a beautiful little rat up in cotton wool,
*  and I'm warming its feet with this pad,
*  and it's just blissed out,
*  and then poof, he's gone, he's off to,
*  she, I respect their privacy.
*  So that was the early evidence
*  that then led to a series of manipulation studies.
*  The most notable is brilliant.
*  It comes from a colleague in the Netherlands,
*  Oes van Sumeren and his group.
*  They created essentially what was a wet,
*  think about a wetsuit,
*  but that wetsuit is covered with all of these thin tubes,
*  almost like veins that go all over the suit
*  to all territories of your body.
*  And then what they would be able to do is perfuse water,
*  warm water or hot water,
*  exquisitely to different parts of the brain or the body.
*  Cool.
*  Amazing, yeah, no pun intended.
*  Thank you.
*  So what they did was then they started to manipulate
*  these peripheral regions sort of,
*  and sure enough, when they did this,
*  they were able to have individuals fall asleep 25% faster,
*  and these were healthy individuals who are normally sleeping
*  within a very natural, quick period of time,
*  but they were able to lop off 25% of that time
*  simply by warming these certain parts of the brain
*  to lift the blood away from the core of the body,
*  and by doing that,
*  they accelerated the temperature core deceleration
*  and therefore increased or accelerated the speed
*  with which sleep arrived to those individuals.
*  Sleep appeared with much greater alacrity
*  than it would have done otherwise,
*  even though it was quick anyway.
*  So then not being satisfied with that,
*  they moved on to the deep sleep trigger zone,
*  and this isn't, you need to stay cool to stay asleep,
*  and here now they started to just continue to cool the core,
*  the central aspects of the body.
*  What they were able to do
*  is increase the amount of deep sleep
*  by somewhere between 25 to,
*  look at some of the data, almost 40 minutes,
*  they were able to boost the amount of deep sleep
*  with the thermal manipulation,
*  and when they were measuring the electrical brain waves
*  and they decompose those brain waves,
*  even the power and the electrical quality
*  of those slow waves was increased, very impressive too.
*  Next, not being satisfied with that,
*  they turned to older adults
*  for the reasons that we've just described.
*  What they found was that in those older adults
*  when they were not manipulated with this thermal temperature,
*  in the second half of the night,
*  there was a 50% probability
*  that they were going to be awake
*  for some part of the second half of the night.
*  When they did the thermal manipulation,
*  they dropped that number down to 5%.
*  So they reduced a 50% probability of waking up
*  down to 5% in older adults,
*  and again, they improved the quality of their deep sleep.
*  Think about, by the way,
*  why that was so effective for older adults.
*  I guarantee you, you've probably seen,
*  you've been in a warm climate
*  or you've been down on the beach,
*  here sort of in Los Angeles,
*  and people are out in shorts and t-shirts or crop tops,
*  and then occasionally there will be someone,
*  and I love seeing these sites where, you know,
*  a child is sort of wheeling along,
*  their elderly parents, a beautiful sort of scene of caring,
*  but the older adult, they're not dressed in the same way
*  that everyone else is dressed on the beach.
*  They are wrapped up, some of them have a woolen hat on.
*  Why?
*  Older adults cannot thermoregulate anywhere near as well
*  as young adults.
*  Is that right?
*  And it's the reason that older adults will always be saying,
*  I'm just so cold.
*  And my hands and my feet especially are always cold.
*  Now that's a problem for sleep,
*  because if you cannot vasodilate
*  at the level of your hands and your feet,
*  you can't get the blood out from the core,
*  you can't drop your core body temperature as much.
*  And we started to understand from those types of data
*  that part of the aging sleep-related problem equation
*  is not just that the brain deteriorates
*  in sleep-related regions,
*  which we've been doing most of our work on,
*  it's also part of a body equation
*  and a thermoregulatory equation.
*  There was also a great study unrelated from Australia.
*  They looked at insomnia patients,
*  and they put their hands or their feet in warm water.
*  And by doing that, it's a manipulation.
*  You can see how quickly their hands and their feet,
*  what we call vasodilate, fill with blood.
*  Healthy people vasodilated very quickly
*  in response to that warm water,
*  meaning that their hands and their feet had this red,
*  or at least for my feet, they would be this red tone to them.
*  However, in the insomnia patients,
*  they did not vasodilate anywhere near as well.
*  So once again, it suggests
*  that when you have problems with sleep,
*  part of the equation may be
*  that you have impaired thermoregulatory ability,
*  and we do see this in insomnia patients.
*  So that was, I think, a brilliant causal manipulation.
*  The problem is that most of us don't have access
*  to a sort of come-to-bed-eyes thermal suit.
*  So what can we do as a concert?
*  Please don't cut that.
*  I'll get myself into terrible trouble, rightly so.
*  I should be punished.
*  You'll be all right.
*  What they did then was to say,
*  well, okay, let's look at this.
*  Is there something that we could do
*  that's cheaper and more accessible to the general public?
*  And if you look, there's a literature
*  that preceded that manipulation,
*  and it's so reliable that we now have a term for it
*  in sleep science.
*  It's called the warm bath effect.
*  And many people will say,
*  look, I love to have a warm bath
*  or a hot shower before bed,
*  and I think when I get out, I'm nice and toasty,
*  and it's because I'm nice and warm
*  that I fall asleep and I stay asleep.
*  It's the exact opposite.
*  When you get out of the warm bath or the shower,
*  you have once again vasodilated at the surface of your skin.
*  You get out of the bath,
*  you get this huge thermal dump of heat away from the core.
*  What happens?
*  You fall asleep and you stay asleep, more sadly.
*  Now there are other reasons that that has a benefit.
*  It's relaxing, you decompress,
*  you're staying away from technology, et cetera,
*  but that is one of the thermal benefits.
*  And in fact, there were studies by a legend in my field
*  who passed away just a few years ago,
*  Jim Horn at Loughborough University in the UK,
*  and they did some of these pioneering studies.
*  They were able to improve the amount of deep sleep
*  by almost 40 minutes in some individuals.
*  What was the protocol there?
*  As I recall, I think they were in the bath
*  for somewhere around, or the bath duration time
*  was somewhere around 30 minutes,
*  but they were doing sort of segments where it was,
*  maybe it was 40 minutes, 10 minutes in,
*  and then you could sort of get out.
*  I think the temperature, because it was UK,
*  was around about 40 degrees Celsius,
*  somewhere in that region.
*  I may be getting those numbers wrong,
*  because I know we like to protocolize some of this,
*  but they were able to show some really pleasant benefits
*  to deep sleep.
*  It also helped people fall asleep,
*  helped them fall asleep by about 25 minutes faster
*  in those people who were really having
*  a hard time with sleep.
*  I'm gonna take a hot bath tonight.
*  I sometimes do the sauna in the evening before sleep.
*  I'm a big fan of cold in the morning,
*  cold shower, cold plunge in the morning.
*  Because you're reverse engineering the equation.
*  You're trapping the heat into the core of your body.
*  You're waking yourself up.
*  Right, and then the evening I've used sauna.
*  The one issue with sauna is I really crank
*  the heat of the sauna, and then sometimes
*  if you do that right before bed,
*  you take a warmest shower right afterwards,
*  you get into bed, oftentimes I'll wake up thirsty,
*  and then, because it dehydrates you,
*  and then if I drink a lot of water to hydrate
*  after I'm in the sauna, then I'm waking up
*  too much in the middle of the night.
*  So I think sauna is great, but right before bed.
*  I would love to, I don't have a sauna at home
*  or an access to, I mean, there are saunas
*  in and around where I live, but what I want to do
*  is have it proximal to my bedtime.
*  And my bedtime, because I'm a neutral type,
*  sort of around 11-ish, nowhere is open
*  and willing to allow me to sit in the,
*  how long do you sit in there usually?
*  I'm a little bonkers about this.
*  Well, if it's in the evening and I just want to relax,
*  I would say maybe 20, 30 minutes,
*  and I tend to go really warm, warmer than I want to stay here.
*  What does Peter do?
*  Peter, you're a friend.
*  Is he about the same?
*  I've done a sauna cold plunge with Peter.
*  He usually does it in the evening,
*  goes sauna cold, sauna cold, sauna cold, warm shower,
*  and I don't know how many nights a week he's doing that,
*  but in terms of the temperature of the sauna,
*  generally somewhere between 175 and 210 degrees,
*  depending on how heat-adapted you are.
*  But I think a hot bath is great, or a nice hot shower.
*  Yeah, I've certainly done that.
*  And when I'm traveling with jet lag, I will absolutely,
*  that's part of my sort of jet lag protocol.
*  I'll make sure I do,
*  because I don't really struggle too much with sleep,
*  at least at present, but when I go through jet lag
*  and I go back home to London, of course it's tough.
*  The worst, jet lag's the worst.
*  Protocolize the living daylights out of that
*  and do as much as I can.
*  So I think that's probably the end of the thermal story.
*  Although we are now trying to see
*  if we can take low-fi approaches
*  where we're going to do some foot warming,
*  we're trying to develop some foot warming technology
*  that can be built into maybe a mattress,
*  and some mattress companies, there are some great ones.
*  I know obviously Matteo at 8 Sleep,
*  and they are doing amazing things.
*  I think his company, again, I have no affiliation,
*  but we connect very well, and he's brilliant.
*  So they're doing something like that.
*  I do use and love my 8 Sleep.
*  Here's what I'd love somebody to engineer.
*  And we've got a lot of people who listen to the podcast
*  who think about product development.
*  It would be wonderful to have a portable pair of socks
*  so that you can use them when you travel
*  or when you go sleep anywhere at home or elsewhere
*  that would warm your feet up at the beginning of the night.
*  So this is a place for us to recap.
*  Warm up, to cool down, to fall asleep, right?
*  Stay cool, stay cool, to stay asleep,
*  and then warm up in the morning to wake up.
*  And so that is pretty straightforward
*  to build into a pair of socks.
*  Somebody can do this, somebody do this.
*  Okay.
*  So that's, so we've done electrical, we've done thermal.
*  What about auditory?
*  Auditory, so acoustic stimulation.
*  In a very similar way to electrical stimulation
*  where you're trying to target that deep sleep
*  and see if you, a better analogy is probably a metronome.
*  And you're trying to see if you can kind of force
*  the metronome further over and back and forth
*  with these types of technologies.
*  So auditory stimulation came on the map again.
*  I think probably Jan Born's group in Germany
*  was some of the first to do this.
*  They initially started with this same generalized approach
*  where they would take acoustic tones
*  and they would first assess what is your level
*  of awakening threshold so you'd be asleep.
*  And they would just have these tones, very light tones,
*  like a sort of ping, ping.
*  And they would gradually increase the volume up
*  and they would look to see what is the point
*  where that volume of the tone wakes you up.
*  And then they understood your specific threshold,
*  what's called an awakening threshold,
*  and they would set the volume
*  to a sub-awakening threshold.
*  Great, so you've got that locked in place.
*  And now you start, and they did this within the first
*  90 minutes of people falling asleep,
*  they started to play these sub-awakening level,
*  volume levels of tones, but they were playing them
*  at this very slow frequency as if again,
*  they're trying to sync and match the slow dancing rhythm
*  of the slow brain waves.
*  And sure enough, in that first study,
*  and it was indiscriminate, meaning they just set the tones,
*  like a metronome, set the tone, set the volume,
*  and then set the cadence of the volume,
*  the speed, the frequency of those tones
*  to just a little bit less than one hertz,
*  a little bit less than one cycle per second.
*  And then off you drifted to sleep
*  and they played it for the first 90 minutes
*  because that's the rich phase of deep sleep.
*  And they were able to increase
*  the amount of deep sleep significantly.
*  The problem in that first study
*  was that they also did a memory test
*  because in all of these studies, including my own,
*  even if I boost your sleep tonight, Andrew Huberman,
*  my next, if that's the result that you show me,
*  I have four words for you as a scientist,
*  yes and so what?
*  Is it functional?
*  Because if I boost your sleep,
*  but it doesn't change anything
*  to you, the organism, the next day,
*  I'm going to suggest that that enhancement
*  is epiphenomenal, not functional.
*  So it has to improve some reasonable metric
*  in wakefulness that improved memory,
*  improved task switching ability.
*  So it's outcome measures.
*  Rift strength.
*  Correct, yeah.
*  So even if I, for example, lower your blood pressure
*  with a new drug, if I'm not changing
*  your cardiovascular disease risk,
*  then the question is, why am I just continuing on
*  with the drug if it's not really changing much?
*  Same thing here, and what they found
*  was that when they did the memory test the next morning,
*  by enhancing that deep sleep,
*  there actually wasn't a memory benefit.
*  So perhaps what was happening
*  is that this was just nonspecific.
*  So again, they then returned,
*  and now others have returned,
*  to the closed loop mechanism
*  where now I've got electrodes on your head
*  and I'm measuring your slow wave brain waves,
*  and literally I am next door in the room
*  and I'm watching those slow brain waves go up and down,
*  and then I've got a computer algorithm
*  that is watching those, watching in quotes,
*  watching that too, and it's predicting
*  when the next wave is going to come,
*  and when it does, auditory tone clicks,
*  subawakening, you don't wake up,
*  and sure enough, when you sort of tone into the brain
*  at that time, you boost the size of that brain wave.
*  And once again, they boosted the size
*  of those deep sleep brain waves.
*  They also improved those more quick bursts of activity,
*  the sleep spindles, and now sure enough,
*  they were able to improve memory.
*  However, if you look at that paper,
*  and here's why I think the first method
*  may not have worked very well,
*  and why I don't suggest people
*  start trying to set this up themselves.
*  When they kept stimulating the brain,
*  slow wave after slow wave,
*  after about three or four strikes of the metronome
*  to boost those slow waves, the benefit stopped.
*  And if they kept going, you started to inhibit
*  the amount of naturally occurring deep sleep brain waves.
*  Why would it do this?
*  Deep sleep brain waves, I told you in the first episode,
*  are a act of incredible neural coordination.
*  It's mass coordination.
*  Now, one of the extreme versions
*  of mass coordinated propagated activity
*  that is maladaptive, that is pathological,
*  is called an epileptic seizure.
*  And your brain has in place for the most part,
*  stop gaps to prevent that type of spread
*  of vast amounts of coordinated,
*  spontaneous electrical oscillations,
*  because the brain is such a conductive device
*  that once you get it going, you've got to be careful,
*  because it may start to conduct out of control.
*  So we think that these checks and balances
*  that were in place, even though you can artificially
*  stimulate it for a while, after a while the brain says,
*  you've got to back off for a while,
*  because this is getting a little bit out of control.
*  You do a breath pause, and then you restart again,
*  and you get the benefit, and then you breath pause.
*  So you've got to do it a little bit intimately.
*  Now, you've got to read what we call
*  the supplemental materials of that paper.
*  You've got to go, it's like the fine print
*  on a legal document.
*  If you dig into it, you can see that that was the case.
*  But it wasn't necessarily evident.
*  So those were really the data on acoustic stimulation.
*  Now with this closed loop acoustic stimulation
*  that we've got going on,
*  it seems to provide these nice benefits.
*  Some people then will probably be asking,
*  what about these noise machines?
*  What about white noise, et cetera?
*  I've taken a look at this, and so far,
*  I think for white noise machines,
*  the data is equivocal.
*  There was a recent study, a review article,
*  I think it looked at about 37 different studies.
*  I could have this wrong.
*  And what they found was that there was no reliable,
*  robust directional effect of white noise machines on sleep.
*  Some studies demonstrated that it helped sleep.
*  Some studies didn't change sleep.
*  Some studies suggested it may make sleep a little bit worse.
*  Just nothing reliable.
*  But maybe it's masking external sound.
*  Correct.
*  So I think if, and one of the positive studies
*  in that scenario was a study that was done in New York City.
*  And it was in a region where there was a lot of
*  external sound pollution and noise,
*  as you could well imagine, it's New York City.
*  And sure enough, that's where they got some really nice
*  benefits of the white noise machine.
*  So I think it is, you're right, context dependent.
*  There was an interesting recent study that came out
*  from Eaterman Learners Group at the University
*  of Texas San Antonio.
*  And they didn't use white noise, they used pink noise.
*  Now what's the difference?
*  Pink noise has a little less what we call power or intensity
*  in the higher frequency ranges of the sound spectrum.
*  And it's more enriched in the slower domain
*  of that power spectrum, which you could argue
*  is a bit more fitting with sleep.
*  And I think this study may have been a naps study,
*  or I may be wrong, but anyway, what they found
*  was that they increased total sleep time by,
*  I think it was close to 30 minutes with the pink noise.
*  They did not change the amount of deep sleep,
*  but they did enhance the amount of stage two non-ramp sleep,
*  which we have spoken about before,
*  and we will in subsequent episodes,
*  that is beneficial for things like learning and memory,
*  including motor skills.
*  And they increased the amount of REM sleep
*  to a much more modest degree.
*  But those changes were significant.
*  So I'm not trying to rule out noise machines right now,
*  and I have no affiliation with any company
*  or anything in that space.
*  I don't want to throw the baby out with the bath water.
*  I just simply think that right now,
*  that we don't have enough evidence,
*  but as you and I know as scientists,
*  absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.
*  Just because it doesn't exist doesn't mean
*  that I don't think that it's still a potential route,
*  these types of machines.
*  What about kinesthetic,
*  these stipular tools, protocols?
*  Body position is something that has an interesting relationship
*  to propensity to fall asleep based on brain cooling,
*  that we talked about in another episode.
*  But what about manipulation of the body's movement?
*  Yeah, is there anything in that domain?
*  It sounds wacky at first.
*  Yeah, it does.
*  But I said it, so.
*  But, yeah.
*  I still want to know.
*  Come on, social media, just be nice, be friendly.
*  I would say that if you look back in again,
*  the annals of human history,
*  from the very early inception,
*  you will see mentions of a child being rocked in a manger
*  or rocked in a crib.
*  Often, parents will take their young infant,
*  and you will quote unquote rock them to sleep.
*  And we, as adults, will sometimes get in a hammock,
*  and if you're rocked, what happens?
*  You will fall asleep.
*  It's that prototypical image of someone
*  with a hat over their face and in a hammock,
*  and they've sort of fallen asleep.
*  So it was very clear that something was going on
*  in this space.
*  And then a group from the University of Geneva,
*  led by another fantastic sleep scientist, Sophie Schwartz,
*  did an epic study that, again, it's one of those studies
*  that I probably once more wished I'd done.
*  Here's what they did.
*  They took a bed frame, and then they suspended it
*  on chains from the ceiling.
*  Now, stick with me.
*  I'm not going in that, you know,
*  there's no hot candle wax being applied here.
*  Don't worry, I'll keep it PG again.
*  And then the next thing that they did
*  was connect a rotating arm to that bed
*  at the side of the bed.
*  And that arm would start to simply just push the bed
*  laterally from left to right, left to right.
*  And they started just swinging the bed
*  in a very controlled manner.
*  But here, and I should ask Sophie
*  exactly why they made this choice.
*  They were rotating the bed not at this,
*  sort of around one hertz,
*  which is what we've done with electrical stimulation
*  or acoustic stimulation.
*  They were doing it at 0.25 hertz,
*  which is much slower still.
*  Almost imperceptibly.
*  The bed is rocking, you know, once every four seconds.
*  It's a very slow lull.
*  And sure enough, what they found
*  in the first series of studies,
*  they did a nap study, a 90 minute nap study.
*  When you did this rocking motion
*  versus when the bed was still,
*  they increased the speed with which people fell asleep.
*  They boosted the amount of deep sleep
*  and they boosted the amount of those
*  sleep spindle oscillations that we described.
*  Not satisfied, they then said,
*  well, what happens across a night of sleep?
*  They did it then across a night of sleep.
*  They replicated the same findings
*  and now they got a memory benefit.
*  Now the memory benefit, you could argue is modest.
*  It was 10% of a memory improvement benefit
*  when you woke up from sleep
*  relative to the already sizable benefit
*  that sleep naturally gives
*  when you're not rocking the bed.
*  But you think, well, 10%,
*  if I were, let's say a student,
*  and I got a B and someone, the professor said,
*  look, by the way, there is something that you can do
*  and we can increase your grade by 10%
*  and you can get to an A or an A plus,
*  depending on the grading system.
*  Would you take it?
*  Would you take 10% benefit?
*  Absolutely, you would, so grade point averaging increase.
*  So it isn't trivial necessarily.
*  Well, I also, I'm positively surprised
*  how important this, but so what condition is
*  for you sleep researchers.
*  Yeah, and so what?
*  You know, that enhancement in say deep sleep
*  or rapid eye movement sleep needs to translate
*  to some daytime benefit in order
*  to really get you guys excited.
*  But here's why, I think that's great.
*  It's always great to have a high threshold for excitement.
*  But one of the things that one could argue is that,
*  you know, there are only so many tests
*  that you can have in a laboratory of daytime functioning.
*  I think I am on board the fact
*  that sleep is the bedrock of mental health,
*  physical health and performance.
*  So an improvement in, you know,
*  a statistically significant improvement
*  in deep sleep or REM sleep,
*  to me just seems like that's gotta be good for something.
*  We might not know what that something is
*  to test in the laboratory,
*  but it could be that the threshold for improvement
*  of say gut microbiome production of neurotransmitters is,
*  you know, 0.1% improvement in deep sleep.
*  We don't know, I made that up,
*  so don't quote that statistic anyone.
*  But I so admire the kind of extreme thresholds
*  that you have, what gets you guys excited.
*  Well, no, your point is a very good one,
*  because you could argue based on what I just went back
*  and said regarding the exercise study with Rhonda Patrick,
*  I've just reversed my own threshold logic.
*  I said to you, well, okay,
*  exercise was able to overcome some of the deficits
*  that occur by way of sleep deprivation for your blood sugar,
*  but don't assume that that necessarily means
*  it overcomes the detriments,
*  the other detriments that you'll have
*  for your hormonal health, your thermoregulatory capacity,
*  your cardiovascular disease, your brain function.
*  So I've just said, look, simply, you know,
*  one thing doesn't mean that you've assessed all things.
*  And now I'm saying, okay,
*  if you don't show that it improved that one thing,
*  then it's not functional.
*  But Matt, by your own logic,
*  you've said that you didn't assess many of the other things.
*  So even if it didn't improve memory,
*  as you said, it's the bedrock of all things health,
*  you need to assess all of them
*  before you make your conclusion of the yes,
*  and so what failed test.
*  So you're absolutely right to point that out.
*  So what was interesting after that data came out in humans,
*  which is usually the opposite way around,
*  they started to look in animal models.
*  And you mentioned the vestibular system,
*  this ability for us to understand motion and movement,
*  and there's lots of mechanisms for that.
*  They looked at mice and they started doing this rocking
*  again, and sure enough, the mice fell asleep faster.
*  But then they found a strain of mice
*  that did not have the lateral vestibular sensation mechanism,
*  and they rocked them just the same way.
*  Zero change in their sleep.
*  Because you could imagine, well,
*  it's important to understand the mechanism here.
*  Is it that when you're rocking,
*  there is, it's not just about vestibular stimulation,
*  maybe that rocking sort of modestly changes friction,
*  which changes temperature.
*  You could come up with all sorts of wacky reasons.
*  This was a very clear causal manipulation
*  of the lateral vestibular system,
*  and if that is not in place, you fail to get the benefit.
*  So it clearly has something to do
*  with the vestibular system.
*  Can I venture a guess as to why that is?
*  Yeah, please.
*  I interrupted, but in case I happen to be right
*  by some chance, I previously talked about
*  the need to lose a sense of one's posture
*  and relationship to gravity in order to fall asleep.
*  Right, you have to go into this lack
*  of proprioceptive awareness in order to fall asleep.
*  Proprioception being the knowledge aware ones.
*  Limbs are relative to the body,
*  and body relative to other surfaces in gravity.
*  And this is something that can be accomplished
*  in these flotation tanks and things like that,
*  and other ways go to outer space.
*  The cheaper version.
*  The cheaper version.
*  So could it be that the rocking at that very slow frequency
*  is tapping into the vestibular system in a way
*  that that proprioceptive feedback about body position
*  is somehow starts to vanish?
*  I'm intrigued by this idea that you have to lose
*  perception of your body's positioning
*  and proprioceptive awareness in order to fall asleep.
*  And maybe your description earlier of a protocol
*  of going on a mental walk in order to fall asleep.
*  I just feel like these things are starting to converge
*  on some themes here.
*  Our central common pathway that could be
*  the absence of proprio...
*  I think it's entirely possible.
*  In some ways, right now we think that these two things
*  are associated that as you're falling asleep,
*  gradually you will lose proprioceptive sensation.
*  But simply the fact that two things are associated
*  doesn't necessarily mean they're causal.
*  But your suggestion here is a very elegant way
*  of testing that hypothesis.
*  Which is that perhaps if you could show that the symmetric
*  of proprioception becomes compromised
*  when you start doing lateral kinesthetic
*  or movement stimulation,
*  that's a very powerful demonstration that it's not just...
*  So here with the sardine and the mice,
*  they lacked the lateral vestibular sensation
*  and you lost the sleep benefit.
*  But maybe there's one step down,
*  which is that when you lose that vestibular stimulation,
*  you lose the benefit on the thing
*  that really is augmenting the sleep,
*  which is the change in proprioception.
*  So this is the first step in a chain of command
*  and you've missed the final common transactor
*  of that ingredient called better sleep.
*  Those I would say are probably the four current bastions
*  of sleep augmentation.
*  Hopefully that describes to listeners the range
*  of where sort of sleep 3.0, sleep enhancement 3.0 is going
*  and also describes the way in which we can come down
*  the strata from high friction, low friction to no friction.
*  And also in terms of cost where you can have high cost,
*  minimal cost, low cost.
*  I mean, hot bath or a shower is pennies on the dollars.
*  Especially if you take a cold shower in the morning
*  and save on your heating bill.
*  So you can take a little bit longer hot shower
*  in the evening and then you net to zero difference.
*  It's just my way of saying,
*  take a cold shower in the morning.
*  Feels great when you get out.
*  What about some ways to enhance rapid eye movement sleep
*  beyond what you've covered up until now?
*  So I think there are probably two emerging data sets
*  that I've been intrigued by.
*  One of which we've been doing some work on
*  and it comes back to thermal.
*  What I failed to mention is not just that you need to warm up
*  to wake up, which you do,
*  but you also need to warm up to REM sleep,
*  but not too much.
*  If you take an organism or a human being
*  and you strip them of bed sheets and strip them of clothes,
*  so they're basically almost au naturel.
*  If you warm the body up to what we call
*  the thermo neutral point.
*  So it tends to be, and this sounds extreme in it,
*  you don't have to do this because you're under sheets
*  and that makes a world of difference.
*  But if you warm the room to about 30 degrees Celsius,
*  which gets close to at the surface ambient level
*  for your skin, something that can bring
*  your core body temperature up, back up to operating.
*  Because I told you when you go,
*  when you're in that deep sleep trigger zone,
*  the middle zone, your core body temperature drops
*  and it drops significantly.
*  And to wake up, you have to warm up.
*  But on the journey to warming up,
*  you also have to get to thermo neutrality
*  for you to have REM sleep.
*  If I keep you too cold,
*  I can reduce the amount of REM sleep.
*  If I get you too hot, I can impair the amount of REM sleep.
*  So it's a Goldilocks phenomenon,
*  not too little, not too much, just the right amount.
*  If I keep you there in terms of your thermal net neutrality,
*  I can boost your REM sleep.
*  Now that's fiendishly difficult when you're trying
*  to solve that equation as a commercial device
*  because different people are under different blankets,
*  they run at different hot temperatures,
*  they've got different partner situations.
*  So you need a closed loop system again.
*  But it's something that we're very interested in
*  because almost all of the methods that I've described
*  and you were smart to pick this up,
*  all target deep non-REM sleep.
*  But we spoke about in the first episode,
*  every stage of sleep is important.
*  And in subsequent episodes,
*  I'll tell you exactly why REM sleep is so critical.
*  So how can we boost that?
*  That's one way that we're starting to explore it,
*  but nothing I think solid yet.
*  The other is some of the drugs,
*  the newest sleep medications
*  that have come onto the market.
*  And again, I think I mentioned I did take the task
*  and I feel perhaps rightfully so
*  about the classic sleep medications
*  that if you look at the scientific data,
*  if you can avoid them, it's probably best to do so.
*  There's-
*  Ambiance, et cetera.
*  We call them the Z drugs
*  because they all start the sort of generic names,
*  sort of start with a Z.
*  Ambien, for example, has a Z at the start of it
*  for its generic name,
*  but I don't want to get into naming any necessarily brands.
*  That's right, they'll come after me.
*  Yeah, Zolpidum, but for Ambien.
*  What's interesting about those medications,
*  again, they're in a class of drugs
*  that we call the sedative hypnotics.
*  So again, sedation, not sleep.
*  And also there's been some great work,
*  again, by Dirk Jan Dijk and colleagues.
*  If I were to show you that electrical signature
*  of your deep sleep,
*  it does look as though those drugs
*  kind of increase the amount of electrical activity
*  in that slower deep sleep range,
*  except once you go all the way to the far left,
*  to the slowest of those slow brain waves,
*  which turns out to be the types of waves
*  that are most beneficial
*  for most health-related brain and body functions,
*  you get this huge dent
*  in your electrical brain wave activity.
*  It's almost as though those drugs take a bite
*  out of that realm of electrical activity.
*  And of course there are issues with daytime sleepiness
*  and some safety-related issues.
*  There's been health associations, not necessarily causal.
*  And so I offered one scientific viewpoint
*  of those medications in the book, and so be it.
*  It's not as though I'm anti-medication, as I said,
*  and some of the new medications are very interesting.
*  So REM sleep, there's a new class of sleep medications
*  called the DORAs, and it stands for,
*  it's D-O-R-A, small s,
*  and it stands for dual-orexin receptor antagonists.
*  Oh my goodness, mouthful,
*  that just sounds like word salad
*  to anyone who's not a neuroscientist.
*  Orexin, which is part of that set of words,
*  is a chemical in the brain.
*  And orexin became prominent with the study of narcolepsy.
*  And what we, we as the royal we,
*  people like Emmanuel Mignot and others at Stanford,
*  what they discovered was that narcoleptic patients
*  have a profound deficit in this chemical,
*  orexin, and in the receptors, also called hypocretin.
*  And it has a function both, it turns out,
*  for wakefulness and a function for feeding
*  and eating-related behaviors.
*  Hypocretin was probably more related to it
*  because it was discovered right around the same time.
*  So really two different groups.
*  Yes, exactly, beautiful.
*  Two different groups named it differently.
*  But narcolepsy, as some people may know,
*  is it's a condition to sleep disorder,
*  and one of the symptoms
*  is called excessive daytime sleepiness,
*  where you have inappropriate invasions of sleep
*  during the day when you want to be awake.
*  Why?
*  Well, it turns out that this chemical, orexin,
*  acts like a finger on the light switch
*  of all of the apparatus in your brain
*  that switches on to force you awake.
*  It reaches down into the,
*  it's released from a central part of your brain
*  called the hypothalamus,
*  and it releases down into the brainstem
*  to activate what we call the ascending arousal system
*  or the reticular ascending arousal system of the brain.
*  And when that lights up,
*  it's like the light switch which says on
*  for waking brain activity.
*  And so what was happening was that
*  this orexin up higher up
*  was not forcing the finger of wakefulness on during the day.
*  So almost instead of a switch, which is what you want,
*  it was more like a dimmer switch.
*  And you know, when you get to that dimmer switch point
*  right in the middle where it's flickering,
*  it's on, it's off, it's on, it's off,
*  that's almost the state in which the narcoleptic brain was
*  because they had a deficiency of orexin.
*  So that was the orexin story in narcolepsy.
*  So why is it relevant for insomnia?
*  Well, people realized the problem with narcolepsy
*  is that they're asleep during the day
*  when they want to be awake.
*  But the opposite problem is true of insomnia patients.
*  They want to be asleep at night, but they're awake.
*  So why don't we selectively develop a drug
*  that goes after this finger
*  that flips the light switch on for wakefulness,
*  but now let's block it at night.
*  So we flick the switch back in the off position,
*  we turn out the lights for the brain,
*  and we remove the problem of insomnia,
*  which is excessive wakefulness at night,
*  which is one of its problems.
*  And therefore, when you remove that,
*  indirectly what comes in its place
*  is this thing called more naturalistic sleep.
*  And that's why it's been more favored now
*  as the principal drug.
*  It's still not necessarily well known by physicians,
*  or it's not very well prescribed.
*  It's not very well covered here in the United States,
*  unfortunately, with insurance.
*  So it's a very expensive option right now.
*  Health providers will choose not to do that, unfortunately.
*  So what's interesting about that drug though,
*  is that it's mixed in terms of the studies,
*  but quite reliably, it does seem to improve sleep,
*  very much so.
*  But it seems to unlike those classic sleeping pills,
*  which artificially look like they're increasing deep sleep,
*  even though they're not doing sedation.
*  These drugs can improve most all aspects of sleep,
*  but including REM sleep,
*  which those classic sleeping pills did not.
*  Why is it doing that?
*  We still don't know,
*  but one of the things that these Dora drugs do
*  that block the erexin,
*  that take off the on position of the light switch
*  and flip them off.
*  When you switch it off,
*  it can actually then allow the activation
*  or the stimulation of something called
*  melanin concentrated hormone or MCH in the brain.
*  And that when it is triggered on,
*  can stimulate another chemical called acetylcholine
*  in the brain, which is a neurotransmitter.
*  If there is one neurotransmitter in the brain
*  that seems to be responsible almost exclusively
*  for this thing called REM sleep,
*  or dominantly, I should say for REM sleep,
*  it is acetylcholine.
*  And this was discovered way back in the 1970s
*  by my former, one of my former mentors,
*  Alan Hobson at Harvard.
*  And what this drug may be doing is indirectly boosting
*  the amounts of acetylcholine in the brain,
*  particularly in a region of the brain
*  called the basal forebrain,
*  which is a REM sleep regulating region.
*  And that's the reason that you get boosts in REM sleep.
*  And people also report dreaming a little bit more too
*  on those medications.
*  So thermal manipulation,
*  getting you to net neutral thermal zones
*  helps increase REM sleep.
*  But also there are some medications
*  that were not necessarily designed for REM sleep,
*  enhancements selectively,
*  but there is evidence that they do that.
*  So if you ask me, where are we at with REM?
*  It's certainly more bereft of methods
*  than deep non-REM sleep,
*  but we are starting to find some now.
*  Given what you just told us about the role of acetylcholine
*  in rapid eye movement sleep,
*  what about taking precursors to acetylcholine?
*  Certainly a good number of them exist.
*  Even over-the-counter supplements like AlphaGPC.
*  And then of course there are choline donors
*  and things like that
*  that can increase cholinergic transmission.
*  Is that getting to issues of,
*  if one does that globally,
*  is it possible that you increase arousal
*  and have trouble falling asleep?
*  Because some of those cholinergic agents
*  can be activating.
*  So that's one of the problems.
*  The second is, you may stop,
*  because you're going to have to take them before bed,
*  you may force REM sleep to arrive earlier
*  and you may therefore come at the cost of deep non-REM sleep.
*  And so you'd have to get some kind of timed release capsule,
*  which you can do.
*  You can coat these capsules and you can get a timed release.
*  And you would want to take it before bed.
*  And then maybe after about four or five hours,
*  you would want to kick it into gear
*  because now you're in.
*  So it's a little bit-
*  It gets tricky.
*  Gets a bit tricky.
*  Yeah, this is one of the reasons why I personally,
*  this is just my experience,
*  I'm not a fan of supplements
*  that tap into the serotonergic system for sake of sleep.
*  Yeah.
*  Because certainly serotonin
*  plays an important role in sleep.
*  But anytime I've taken something,
*  5-HTP or something like that to try and improve sleep,
*  I find that I fall asleep and then I wake up very deep,
*  deep sleep and then I wake up very alert
*  and I have trouble with the later phases of sleep.
*  And I think that is because,
*  yes, serotonin is involved in sleep,
*  but it's involved in sleep at a very specific point in this,
*  as you refer to it, this like symphony or ballet
*  of different sleep stages and how they evolve
*  and interdigitate with one another across the night.
*  So while I do think there are things
*  that one can use pharmacologically
*  or supplement-based to improve sleep,
*  generally, I like to think of those as the kind of thing
*  that kind of pushes a wavefront of the whole sleep process,
*  as opposed to trying to tap into one specific neurotransmitter
*  within the sleep ballet.
*  Exactly, yeah.
*  I like that way of thinking and you do have to be careful.
*  Because in biology, it's often rare
*  that there are any free lunches.
*  In truth, nature has optimized our system so exquisitely
*  that when you start to try and game the system
*  for one thing, be very mindful that it may come
*  at the cost of something else.
*  And that's why whenever we're doing these types
*  of sort of developments of technologies for sleep,
*  we are very cautious not just to say,
*  did we improve the thing that we're targeting?
*  But first call of business in medicine is,
*  not will this drug help you, but firstly,
*  is there any downside in terms of will this drug hurt you?
*  And then you have to understand the cost ratio benefit
*  between those two things.
*  Yeah, just one more anecdote
*  that is in agreement with what you said.
*  Nowadays, there's an increased excitement around peptides,
*  the use of peptides.
*  And I currently don't use any, but I did a short run
*  with occasional use of Cermerelin, which is a secretagogue,
*  which is a growth hormone.
*  It promotes the secretion of growth hormone,
*  not growth hormone itself.
*  I took it not many times and I was tracking my sleep.
*  And what I noticed is it put me into a little bit
*  of a hypnotic state.
*  Dreams were very intense, but deep, deep sleep.
*  But according to my sleep tracker,
*  I only ran this for maybe three nights.
*  According to my sleep tracker,
*  it completely eliminated all my rapid eye movement sleep,
*  at least as measured by the sleep tracker.
*  But the amount of deep sleep, slow wave sleep,
*  just massively expanded.
*  So that can't be good.
*  That can't be good.
*  You don't want to mess with that cocktail ratio
*  that we described in the first episode.
*  We presume that it's emerged as the correct
*  Da Vinci code of sleep stage recipes.
*  And there may be a time and a place where you want to
*  over-index on one of those things for whatever reason.
*  But to do it consistently and permanently,
*  I would again say if you think within the space
*  of a lifetime that you know something that,
*  you know, 2.6 million years of evolution
*  has not understood, chances are you're probably wrong.
*  I agree.
*  And certainly later in this series,
*  we will touch into some of the over-the-counter supplements
*  and other things that one can do in order to augment sleep
*  that do seem to have some benefit
*  because there are such things.
*  But in the meantime, thank you for providing
*  this incredible arc of description of basic sleep hygiene
*  and regularity, light, dark temperature,
*  getting out of bed when you can't sleep,
*  alcohol, food, caffeine, cannabis,
*  unconventional protocols and let's call them advanced
*  protocols, electrical protocol, brain stimulation,
*  in other words, thermal manipulation, auditory stimulation,
*  kinesthetic, and then these rapid eye movement
*  enhancing drugs and on and on.
*  Matt, I can't thank you enough.
*  This has been just replete with actionable tools
*  and considerations and I love that you took us
*  to the cutting edge of what's happening now.
*  I think it's wonderful to talk about the history
*  of the field and what was discovered.
*  It's wonderful to talk about the present,
*  but it's wonderful that you've put our eyes a bit
*  into the future of what the technology
*  for sleep enhancement and monitoring holds.
*  So once again, thank you.
*  You're so welcome.

*  should they choose right away.
*  And by moving on, I mean to sleep.
