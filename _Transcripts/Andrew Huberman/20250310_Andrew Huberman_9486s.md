Video Description: My guest is Dr. John Kruse, M.D., Ph.D., a psychiatrist specializing in treating people with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We discuss the many stimulant and nonstimulant ADHD medications available, covering both their potential benefits and risks. We also explore behavioral approaches to managing ADHD, the key role of maintaining a consistent sleep-wake schedule, and the impact of exercise, fish oil supplementation, and video games on ADHD. Additionally, we examine the genetic and environmental factors contributing to the rise in adult and child ADHD diagnoses and offer various options to consider if you or someone you know is struggling with focus.

# Improve Focus with Behavioral Tools & Medication for ADHD | Dr. John Kruse
**Andrew Huberman:** [March 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU)
*  Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=0.0s)]
*  where we discuss science [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2.2800000000000002s)]
*  and science-based tools for everyday life. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3.72s)]
*  I'm Andrew Huberman, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9.24s)]
*  and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=10.32s)]
*  at Stanford School of Medicine. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=13.44s)]
*  My guest today is Dr. John Cruz. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  Dr. John Cruz is an MD, PhD, and practicing psychiatrist [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=17.28s)]
*  who specializes in the treatment of ADHD [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  in both kids and in adults. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=23.92s)]
*  As you'll see during today's episode, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=26.04s)]
*  Dr. Cruz is among the world's top experts [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=27.8s)]
*  in understanding the various treatments for ADHD [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=30.34s)]
*  and tools for helping to overcome non-clinical issues [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=33.0s)]
*  with focus and attention. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=35.8s)]
*  We, of course, discuss the drug treatments for ADHD. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=37.36s)]
*  So those include Adderall, Ritalin, Vivance, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=40.04s)]
*  Modafinil, Welbutrin, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=43.16s)]
*  basically all the drugs that are used to treat ADHD, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=44.980000000000004s)]
*  and we cover their relative advantages and disadvantages. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=48.0s)]
*  We also talk about the use of caffeine for focus [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=51.2s)]
*  and how caffeine can interact with those various drugs. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=53.400000000000006s)]
*  Dr. Cruz also educates us on how specific behaviors, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=56.36s)]
*  like our sleep timing, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=59.72s)]
*  so not just the amount of sleep we get, but when we sleep, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=61.0s)]
*  as well as our meals, our exercise, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  how all that can shape our levels of attention and focus. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=65.96s)]
*  And that, of course, is relevant [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=68.84s)]
*  not just to people struggling with attention and focus [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=69.88s)]
*  or who have ADHD, but to everybody. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=72.16s)]
*  Dr. Cruz isn't just a psychiatrist. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=74.64s)]
*  He also has a background in circadian biology research, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=76.68s)]
*  and he offers the intriguing idea [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=79.76s)]
*  that ADHD and other deficits and focus [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=81.8s)]
*  may in many cases be the consequence [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=84.2s)]
*  of a misregulated circadian rhythm. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=86.04s)]
*  He tells us how to test that idea [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=88.28s)]
*  and potentially how to fix it. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=90.0s)]
*  By the end of today's episode, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=91.56s)]
*  you'll understand what stimulants do, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=92.78s)]
*  the possible origins of ADHD in both kids and adults, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=94.9s)]
*  and both the behavioral and drug treatments [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=98.32000000000001s)]
*  and non-prescription approaches [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=100.56s)]
*  to overcoming brain fog and focus challenges. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=102.60000000000001s)]
*  So by the end of today's episode, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=105.28s)]
*  you'll be armed with a ton of new knowledge, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=106.60000000000001s)]
*  and you'll have a lot of practical tools you can apply. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=108.72s)]
*  Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=111.78s)]
*  is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=114.62s)]
*  It is, however, part of my desire and effort [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=117.26s)]
*  to bring zero cost to consumer information about science [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=119.42s)]
*  and science-related tools to the general public. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=122.02000000000001s)]
*  In keeping with that theme, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=124.54s)]
*  this episode does include sponsors. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=125.80000000000001s)]
*  And now for my discussion with Dr. John Cruz. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=128.18s)]
*  Dr. John Cruz, welcome. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=131.5s)]
*  I'm glad to be here today. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=133.88s)]
*  Let's talk about ADHD, and probably best [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=135.70000000000002s)]
*  if we start off by just kind of laying out [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=139.6s)]
*  what it is, is the H is the hyperactivity component [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=143.38s)]
*  always in there, childhood ADHD, adult ADHD, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=146.9s)]
*  maybe if you would just give us the top contour of this, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=150.5s)]
*  and then we can get into ways to combat ADHD [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=153.74s)]
*  depending on different circumstances, different needs, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=157.34s)]
*  this sort of thing. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=160.35999999999999s)]
*  I'll just start out by saying that, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=161.5s)]
*  like most things in neuroscience and psychiatry, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=163.2s)]
*  we have some definitions, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=165.94s)]
*  and we have lots of different thoughts and frameworks [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=168.14s)]
*  to approach things. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=170.64s)]
*  So I'll start with our diagnostic category, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=171.54s)]
*  or how we diagnose ADHD, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=174.29999999999998s)]
*  and that is there are 18 different symptoms. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=176.82s)]
*  Nine of them are hyperactive-impulsive. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=180.72s)]
*  Nine of them are inattentive. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=183.26s)]
*  So the inattentive ones are things like [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=185.26s)]
*  forgetting to follow through on things, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=188.5s)]
*  losing items, being easily distracted. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=190.78s)]
*  The impulsive and hyperactive ones [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=195.66s)]
*  are cutting people off in conversations, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=197.82s)]
*  blurting things out, running around, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=200.46s)]
*  fidgeting, the definitions themselves [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=203.62s)]
*  were designed with a child population in mind, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=205.98000000000002s)]
*  because until roughly the mid-90s, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=210.54000000000002s)]
*  it was dogma that this was a developmental disease [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=213.74s)]
*  of childhood, and that every child who had it outgrew it. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=218.22s)]
*  That is dramatically wrong. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=223.06s)]
*  Some kids do, most kids don't. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=226.02s)]
*  The latest work suggests that most adults fluctuate [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=229.52s)]
*  in time with the severity of their ADHD symptoms. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=233.64000000000001s)]
*  So jumping back to the definition, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=236.96s)]
*  so we have these 18 different symptoms. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=238.36s)]
*  As an adult, you need to have at least five of them, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=241.42000000000002s)]
*  and when we say have them, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=244.0s)]
*  all of these are things that normal people [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=246.78s)]
*  can display at any time. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=248.56s)]
*  So any of us might interrupt someone, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=250.28s)]
*  might have trouble sitting, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=252.72s)]
*  might have trouble attending to a task, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=254.3s)]
*  but to meet the criteria, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=257.64s)]
*  these have to be displayed in excessive amount of time [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=259.04s)]
*  or to an excessive degree, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=264.16s)]
*  to the extent that they're causing some dysfunction [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=266.40000000000003s)]
*  or distress, and that they have to be displayed [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=268.72s)]
*  in multiple realms of life. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=271.6s)]
*  So if it's only at work [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=273.40000000000003s)]
*  that you have trouble completing your task, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=275.6s)]
*  that might have something to do with your boss, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=277.62s)]
*  or an uncomfortable chair or something. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=279.24s)]
*  So these have to be traits that are displayed [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=281.40000000000003s)]
*  in multiple realms of life. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=285.16s)]
*  They have to cause, again, distress or dysfunction. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=288.04s)]
*  They have to be to an extent that's beyond [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=291.04s)]
*  what a normal person does. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=294.28s)]
*  And what's strange is often ADHD has a stigma [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=296.92s)]
*  that's not a real diagnosis, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=301.04s)]
*  partly because there isn't some, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=302.56s)]
*  the fancy word is patho-pneumonic, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=305.48s)]
*  some classic symptom that's characteristic exactly of that. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=307.6s)]
*  So with schizophrenia, we have hallucinations. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=311.72s)]
*  Most people aren't having hallucinations. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=314.64s)]
*  If you have those, you might have drug effect, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=316.92s)]
*  but that's unusual. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=320.6s)]
*  Again, with ADHD, they're all usual behaviors. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=322.36s)]
*  It's just to an unusual extent. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=325.08000000000004s)]
*  So the diagnosis comes under a lot of stigma [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=327.24s)]
*  and questioning, isn't this just normal behavior [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=331.12s)]
*  carried to a ridiculous extent? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=334.12s)]
*  So you mentioned that there can be a lot [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=337.32s)]
*  of environmental dependence. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=339.56s)]
*  One thing that I, and I know a lot of people wonder about, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=341.64s)]
*  is with the advent of more people working at home, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=345.16s)]
*  and certainly during lockdowns, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=349.72s)]
*  kids were at home for school as well, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=352.20000000000005s)]
*  but is it the case that when somebody with ADHD [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=355.0s)]
*  is in their home environment, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=360.28000000000003s)]
*  where there are typically more options of things to do, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=361.84000000000003s)]
*  that the symptoms get worse, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=366.28000000000003s)]
*  as opposed to when they go to, say, a restaurant [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=369.04s)]
*  or to school or to play a sport or to work, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=372.04s)]
*  where sure, there are multiple things you can do [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=377.12s)]
*  in those environments, but they're more constrained [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=379.28s)]
*  in terms of the different sides of oneself, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=381.68s)]
*  the different activities that one tends to engage in. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=384.28s)]
*  Is that common? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=387.88s)]
*  Yeah, so I'll back up a little bit. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=390.12s)]
*  Like all of our other mental health [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=392.04s)]
*  or psychiatric conditions, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=393.6s)]
*  there's clearly both a biological component to ADHD [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=394.92s)]
*  and clearly a social environment, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=398.04s)]
*  the nature and nurture question isn't which is it, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=400.72s)]
*  it's always both. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=403.0s)]
*  So with ADHD, we know there's a very strong [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=404.40000000000003s)]
*  genetic component, the heritability factor is around .8, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=406.88000000000005s)]
*  which is about as strong as the heritability factor [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=411.32000000000005s)]
*  for height or for schizophrenia. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=414.08000000000004s)]
*  So does that mean that if you're an identical twin [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=415.88000000000005s)]
*  and your twin has ADHD, that there's a sort of, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=418.6s)]
*  essentially a .8 probability that you'll have it as well, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=423.32000000000005s)]
*  or is this through the- [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=426.12s)]
*  Yeah, I mean heritability is a little more [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=426.96s)]
*  technically sophisticated and it's about the variance [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=429.47999999999996s)]
*  due to genetic, but it's high likelihood. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=432.96s)]
*  So this tends to run in families, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=436.56s)]
*  but again, it has a social, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=438.56s)]
*  you're not just a brain in the world, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=442.08s)]
*  you're a brain interacting with the world. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=443.47999999999996s)]
*  And with ADHD, we like to frame it as both [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=445.88s)]
*  structure is important and demands are important. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=449.64s)]
*  So one of the aspects of ADHD, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=452.47999999999996s)]
*  separate from the official, how we categorize it [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=455.16s)]
*  in terms, or diagnose it in terms of symptoms, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=458.76s)]
*  we most often are understanding it this day and age [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=461.4s)]
*  as a problem with executive functions of the brain, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=464.52s)]
*  how the brain's working memory works, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=468.04s)]
*  how selective attention works or doesn't work, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=470.08s)]
*  how emotional regulation is working or not, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=472.88s)]
*  how impulse control is working. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=475.04s)]
*  And essentially, the ADHD brain is less able [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=477.84000000000003s)]
*  to provide the structure it needs, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=482.88s)]
*  so it's more reliant on an optimal structure [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=485.72s)]
*  in the outside world. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=487.76s)]
*  So getting the home versus working in a work office [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=489.40000000000003s)]
*  environment, part of the problem is if you're in a [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=494.40000000000003s)]
*  traditional office environment, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=498.52000000000004s)]
*  you're starting a specific time. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=500.68s)]
*  Everyone else is doing their work at a certain time. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=502.52000000000004s)]
*  When you go to lunch is clear. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=505.64s)]
*  You may have people checking in or seeing you in a hallway. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=507.24s)]
*  Larry is here. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=510.20000000000005s)]
*  How far along are you on this coding project? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=512.2s)]
*  You can be ready for it on time. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=514.2s)]
*  When you're home, you don't get any of that reinforcement. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=516.12s)]
*  You don't have any of that structure. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=520.5200000000001s)]
*  So, I mean, structure is a Goldilocks issue. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=521.84s)]
*  It's not just more structure is always good, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=524.6s)]
*  because if you put or impose too much structure on someone, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=527.88s)]
*  so most people with ADHD are really lousy [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=531.48s)]
*  assembly line workers. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=534.2800000000001s)]
*  They don't wanna be just picking up one bolt, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=535.88s)]
*  screwing it on the side of the Lexus or whatever, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=538.6800000000001s)]
*  and watching the car move down the line. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=541.0400000000001s)]
*  That's too stultifying, too limiting, too structured. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=543.84s)]
*  So you need the optimal amount of structure. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=547.64s)]
*  And with COVID and working from home and kids [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=550.4399999999999s)]
*  being at the home, so one thing it created is less structure [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=555.08s)]
*  for the day, but it also increased the demand [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=558.36s)]
*  side of the equation. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=561.28s)]
*  So the cognitive demand, not only did you have to manage [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=562.84s)]
*  your own time and schedule now, in addition to doing your [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=565.56s)]
*  work, you had to schedule it, but you might have had [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=567.92s)]
*  screaming kids in the other room, or you might have had [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=570.04s)]
*  a partner who wants to use that room for their quiet [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=572.32s)]
*  meetings some of the time when you're trying to do it. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=576.12s)]
*  So the demands increased for many people, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=578.0400000000001s)]
*  and the structure decreased, and that was sort of a, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=581.88s)]
*  that's a perfect storm for creating more ADHD. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=589.4000000000001s)]
*  And what's really interesting from a mental health [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=592.2s)]
*  perspective, at the very start of the COVID epidemic, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=595.84s)]
*  public mental health figures said, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=599.32s)]
*  we know if this is a massive epidemic and we're gonna [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=601.64s)]
*  have to do quarantine, we know depression's gonna go up, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=604.68s)]
*  we know anxiety's gonna go up, we know alcohol and [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=609.12s)]
*  substance abuse is gonna go up, we know PTSD and [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=611.8s)]
*  domestic violence is gonna go up. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=614.56s)]
*  They claimed suicide would go up, that was incorrect, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=617.6s)]
*  and we can get into that, but I think there's an ADHD [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=620.4399999999999s)]
*  reason why it didn't go up. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=623.04s)]
*  Nobody that I heard was mentioning that ADHD would go up. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=624.96s)]
*  And part of it is because partly to hold onto its [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=629.56s)]
*  legitimacy as a real psychiatric diagnosis, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=633.76s)]
*  both many patients and many researchers in the field [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=637.3199999999999s)]
*  hold so strongly to, this is a biological condition, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=640.88s)]
*  why would it change? [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=644.4s)]
*  You know, I mean we can understand why PTSD, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=646.92s)]
*  more people are being traumatized, Uncle Joe just died [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=649.4799999999999s)]
*  from coughing his lungs out from COVID. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=652.1999999999999s)]
*  You know, PTSD it's easy to see. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=654.8s)]
*  Or depression, you've just lost your job and [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=656.92s)]
*  your whole industry, you're a restaurant worker, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=660.08s)]
*  that's not coming back. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=661.6400000000001s)]
*  So we could easily relate stories as to why these other [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=663.7600000000001s)]
*  conditions were gonna go up, but there was no prediction [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=668.36s)]
*  again, mostly because I think the defensiveness of the [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=672.2s)]
*  ADHD community and not wanting to acknowledge as much [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=676.0400000000001s)]
*  that there's a real nurture component and not just a [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=681.0400000000001s)]
*  nature component. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=684.44s)]
*  And yet what we've seen just looking at prescriptions [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=685.8800000000001s)]
*  and the media's jumped all over this, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=690.0s)]
*  not only have ADHD diagnosis gone up considerably, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=692.0799999999999s)]
*  but also prescription stimulants have shot up dramatically [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=696.0s)]
*  in the last few years. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=702.0s)]
*  I'd like to take a quick break and thank our sponsor, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=703.9599999999999s)]
*  8 Sleep. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=706.4s)]
*  8 Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=707.24s)]
*  heating and sleep tracking capacity. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=709.48s)]
*  Now I've spoken before on this podcast about the critical [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=711.56s)]
*  need for us to get adequate amounts of quality sleep [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=713.7199999999999s)]
*  each night. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=716.3199999999999s)]
*  One of the best ways to ensure a great night's sleep [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=717.16s)]
*  is to ensure that the temperature of your sleeping [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=719.3199999999999s)]
*  environment is correct. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=721.4s)]
*  And that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=722.88s)]
*  your body temperature actually has to drop by about [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=726.0s)]
*  one to three degrees. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=728.1999999999999s)]
*  And in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=729.48s)]
*  your body temperature actually has to increase about [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=732.0799999999999s)]
*  one to three degrees. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=734.52s)]
*  8 Sleep makes it very easy to control the temperature [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=735.8399999999999s)]
*  of your sleeping environment by allowing you to program [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=738.0799999999999s)]
*  the temperature of your mattress cover at the beginning, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=740.76s)]
*  middle and end of the night. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=742.92s)]
*  I've been sleeping on an 8 Sleep mattress cover for nearly [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=744.88s)]
*  four years now, and it has completely transformed [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=747.08s)]
*  and improved the quality of my sleep. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=749.96s)]
*  8 Sleep recently launched their newest generation [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=751.96s)]
*  of the pod cover called the Pod 4 Ultra. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=754.2s)]
*  The Pod 4 Ultra has improved cooling and heating capacity. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=757.0400000000001s)]
*  I find that very useful because I like to make the bed [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=760.08s)]
*  really cool at the beginning of the night, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=762.12s)]
*  even colder in the middle of the night, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=763.76s)]
*  and warm as I wake up. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=765.5600000000001s)]
*  That's what gives me the most slow wave sleep [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=767.5600000000001s)]
*  and rapid eye movement sleep. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=769.5600000000001s)]

*  lift your head a few degrees to improve your airflow [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=774.44s)]

*  Now, if there's one thing that I have consistently [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=801.0s)]
*  emphasized on this podcast, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=802.76s)]
*  it is the incredible impact that light can have [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=804.4000000000001s)]
*  on our biology. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=806.76s)]
*  Now, in addition to sunlight, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=807.88s)]
*  red light and near infrared light sources [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=809.12s)]
*  have been shown to have positive effects [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=811.4399999999999s)]
*  on improving numerous aspects of cellar and organ health, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=813.28s)]
*  including faster muscle recovery, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=816.04s)]
*  improved skin health and wound healing, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=817.92s)]
*  improvements in acne, reduced pain and inflammation, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=820.08s)]
*  even mitochondrial function, and improving vision itself. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=823.3199999999999s)]
*  What sets Juv lights apart [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=826.56s)]
*  and why they're my preferred red light therapy device [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=827.88s)]
*  is that they use clinically proven wavelengths, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=830.48s)]
*  meaning specific wavelengths of red light [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=832.48s)]
*  and near infrared light in combination [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=834.76s)]
*  to trigger the optimal cellar adaptations. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=836.96s)]
*  Personally, I use the Juv whole body panel [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=839.76s)]
*  about three to four times a week, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=841.92s)]
*  and I use the Juv handheld light [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=843.48s)]
*  both at home and when I travel. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=845.3199999999999s)]

*  to get up to $400 off. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=864.08s)]
*  I'm fascinated by this relationship [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=866.76s)]
*  between kind of optimal structure and difficulty, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=868.48s)]
*  or at least optimal structure [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=873.24s)]
*  versus having some margins for exploration at one's job. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=875.0400000000001s)]
*  I realize it's very difficult to throw out [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=881.44s)]
*  kind of pan statements about what sorts of work [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=884.2s)]
*  and professions are going to be best for people with ADHD, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=887.24s)]
*  but in your clinical observation, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=890.12s)]
*  can you perhaps point us to kind of clusters of professions [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=893.6s)]
*  where people with ADHD tend to gravitate toward [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=897.8000000000001s)]
*  because they have sufficient or even hyper proficiency there? [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=901.12s)]
*  Like would we say like the creative arts, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=908.0400000000001s)]
*  where as long as they can get themselves to the theater, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=910.08s)]
*  they tend to do well. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=914.84s)]
*  When improv, I'm using extreme kind of almost silly examples, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=915.8000000000001s)]
*  but those are professions indeed, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=919.8000000000001s)]
*  versus a job where people have quote unquote bankers hours, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=921.4s)]
*  where it's nine to five. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=924.4s)]
*  I could see that being an advantage, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=925.76s)]
*  also being very difficult then of course, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=927.56s)]
*  or accounting where literally decimal points matter [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=929.1999999999999s)]
*  and every digit counts. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=932.84s)]
*  So are there sort of clusters? [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=935.24s)]
*  I'm going to step back and answer. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=937.0799999999999s)]
*  I'll get to your answer, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=939.4399999999999s)]
*  but I'm going to frame it two different ways first. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=940.52s)]
*  One is, and I didn't come up with this, [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=944.36s)]
*  but I think it's one of the most insightful quips about ADHD [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=946.12s)]
*  is that non ADHD brains are importance driven. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=949.48s)]
*  If you know you have to move your car [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=953.28s)]
*  because you're going to parking ticket, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=955.36s)]
*  you go out and move it. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=956.48s)]
*  If you know taxes need to be paid in April, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=957.32s)]
*  it's a boring, thankless job. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=960.36s)]
*  Nobody, well, maybe a few people enjoy it, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=962.16s)]
*  but most of us aren't CPAs of art. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=964.4s)]
*  You take care of it. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=967.5600000000001s)]
*  The ADHD brain in contrast is an interest driven brain. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=968.8000000000001s)]
*  So they know, yeah, yeah, yeah, I should be doing my taxes, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=972.84s)]
*  but hey, look at how the Warriors are doing [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=975.04s)]
*  in their basketball playoff game. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=977.08s)]
*  Look at this cool cat video. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=978.68s)]
*  Oh, I'd rather do something else. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=981.0799999999999s)]
*  So regarding career or work, [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=983.68s)]
*  I think the most important thing [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=986.64s)]
*  is that it's interesting to you. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=988.5999999999999s)]
*  So we can talk about realms of work [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=990.68s)]
*  or certain career paths, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=993.7199999999999s)]
*  but if it's not compelling to you, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=996.9599999999999s)]
*  if it's not interesting to you, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1000.5999999999999s)]
*  if it's going to be hard to work at it, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1002.12s)]
*  even if it's structurally maybe a better support for you. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1005.44s)]
*  Does that carry over to other domains of life? [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1009.6400000000001s)]
*  Do you see, for instance, that people with ADHD [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1011.5600000000001s)]
*  have a harder time with parenting? [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1015.08s)]
*  Not that kids aren't super interesting, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1018.2800000000001s)]
*  but some of their activities [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1021.48s)]
*  might be less interesting to parents than others [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1023.44s)]
*  versus people who are just, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1025.72s)]
*  I think of this word importance driven [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1028.24s)]
*  as just kind of like really dutiful. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1029.68s)]
*  Like you do it because you're supposed to do it. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1031.6000000000001s)]
*  Part of how the field actually in the 90s [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1035.08s)]
*  started becoming aware that adults could have ADHD [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1037.76s)]
*  is that all these clinicians [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1041.9199999999998s)]
*  who were having ADHD clinics for kids [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1044.96s)]
*  were starting to notice, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1047.84s)]
*  wait a minute, this parent is showing up 20 minutes late [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1049.56s)]
*  to pick up his kid. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1052.56s)]
*  Wait a minute, the parent didn't fill the prescriptions [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1053.3999999999999s)]
*  so the kid went for two weeks without the medication. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1057.12s)]
*  They started becoming more aware of ADHD in adults [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1060.4399999999998s)]
*  by seeing that the adults who were parents of these kids, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1064.4s)]
*  and again, there's a strong genetic connection, had ADHD. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1067.16s)]
*  So there are certainly wonderful, loving, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1071.16s)]
*  supportive, nurturing parents with ADHD, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1075.64s)]
*  but studies that have looked at [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1078.24s)]
*  trying to find some objective measures [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1081.5600000000002s)]
*  are things more likely to be forgotten, misplaced, mislaid, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1083.3200000000002s)]
*  go off track with an ADHD family, absolutely. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1089.44s)]
*  And one of the more powerful sets of interventions [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1093.04s)]
*  for kids with ADHD separate from medications [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1095.8799999999999s)]
*  is family-based training that helps get the whole family, [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1098.76s)]
*  one, to understand how the kid's brain is working differently, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1102.44s)]
*  but actually it might not be that differently. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1106.0s)]
*  It might be exactly how dad or mom's brain is working, [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1107.6s)]
*  but to help them function as more consistent parents. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1111.56s)]
*  So the other bias, I'd say again, [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1116.8s)]
*  before identifying specific careers [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1119.56s)]
*  is that as a society, we've long cherished or valued, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1122.4s)]
*  the guy who worked 50 years for Eastman Kodak Company [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1128.4s)]
*  and got the gold watch at the end [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1131.68s)]
*  was sort of the epitome [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1132.96s)]
*  of what you should strive for in a career. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1134.96s)]
*  But if you're interest-driven and your interests change, [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1138.2s)]
*  so for many people with ADHD, [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1143.0800000000002s)]
*  the best career is actually not one 50-year career, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1144.6000000000001s)]
*  it's 10 five-year careers or five 10-year careers. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1148.92s)]
*  And part of it is the whole work world [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1153.44s)]
*  has become more fragmented and upheaval [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1155.96s)]
*  is the name of the game and break things quickly [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1159.5600000000002s)]
*  is the motto of Silicon Valley. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1162.16s)]
*  I didn't phrase that quite right, [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1164.1200000000001s)]
*  but the message I think is still there. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1166.2s)]
*  We're accepting more that many career trajectories [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1169.72s)]
*  are gonna look not like just one beautiful arc, [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1173.44s)]
*  but I think there's a sort of a normo-centric bias [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1176.12s)]
*  to that is what you should strive for [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1180.8s)]
*  and if you are changing careers, that's a bad thing. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1182.6399999999999s)]
*  And yet lots of people who do worthwhile things in life [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1187.56s)]
*  and often because of their more varied experience, [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1191.8799999999999s)]
*  they're bringing more to what they're doing. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1195.0s)]
*  So I think we need to value that and embrace that [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1197.32s)]
*  as an option and accept that maybe for some people, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1201.04s)]
*  that is an optimal career path. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1204.4s)]
*  I can relate, I mean, I spent 20 plus years training [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1207.1200000000001s)]
*  to become a bench scientist and run a lab [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1210.3600000000001s)]
*  and then now I still teach and hold my appointment, [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1213.44s)]
*  still involved in a bit of research, [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1215.96s)]
*  but I'm in a second career now-ish [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1217.3600000000001s)]
*  and I imagine there'll be a third. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1222.2s)]
*  We can talk later if you think I have ADHD or not. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1224.88s)]
*  I certainly consume a lot of caffeine [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1227.8000000000002s)]
*  and we'll come back to the idea of the relationship [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1229.24s)]
*  between levels of caffeine consumption and possible ADHD. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1231.2s)]
*  We're seeding the discussion for later on that. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1238.16s)]
*  We hear pretty often that social media [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1240.24s)]
*  and scrolling X or scrolling Instagram or TikTok [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1243.0800000000002s)]
*  is quote unquote giving people ADHD. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1248.48s)]
*  Are there any data, either clinical or otherwise [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1252.24s)]
*  that suggests that the mere practice of looking at [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1256.1200000000001s)]
*  10,000 different contexts or even 15 videos for a minute [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1259.28s)]
*  while standing at the bus stop is somehow creating [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1265.68s)]
*  more distractibility in other domains of life? [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1270.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so I'd say there's a lot of good neuroscience research [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1275.32s)]
*  and neuropsychological data that the more time you spend [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1279.16s)]
*  immersed in social media and it's the constant, [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1283.52s)]
*  it's the barrage of information [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1288.24s)]
*  and not just the volume of information, [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1290.04s)]
*  but that you are constantly being interrupted [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1293.48s)]
*  and that most of these interruptions [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1296.84s)]
*  are intentionally designed to attract your attention [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1299.6s)]
*  and that the more people practice thinking that way [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1303.4s)]
*  or being in the world that way, [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1308.16s)]
*  yes, it's harder to sustain attention [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1310.44s)]
*  for long periods of time, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1312.84s)]
*  that you train yourself to overreact to any new distraction. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1314.64s)]
*  So the core elements of some of the executive functions [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1321.0400000000002s)]
*  that are impaired in ADHD, [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1325.72s)]
*  we are all becoming more ADHD-like. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1327.16s)]
*  So that's the thesis of the book that I've been working on [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1329.92s)]
*  that's still several months from going anywhere, [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1333.64s)]
*  but I call it Attention Deficit World. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1336.3600000000001s)]
*  And one of the things that's been frustrating [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1339.2800000000002s)]
*  is that there's been this huge disconnect. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1341.6000000000001s)]
*  There have been people writing about the question [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1343.68s)]
*  you're asking that the neuroscience, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1346.24s)]
*  our brain's getting more distracted, are we becoming, [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1348.44s)]
*  it's not just distracted. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1351.8s)]
*  Immersion in this media world or social media, [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1353.64s)]
*  cell phone, however you wanna break it down, [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1356.5600000000002s)]
*  it's not all bad, it's not just that concentration's worse. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1359.52s)]
*  So detecting visual items in the environment, [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1362.72s)]
*  there's some things that people become more adept at, [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1367.4s)]
*  whether that's actually a good thing to be more adept at. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1371.0s)]
*  People do a multitask more quickly [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1374.28s)]
*  or switch in and out of it. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1377.72s)]
*  They're still not doing as well on that task [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1378.8s)]
*  if they had no distractions and just focus solely, [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1381.2s)]
*  but they're multitasking better [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1384.0s)]
*  than people who don't immerse themselves a lot [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1385.36s)]
*  in the internet. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1388.12s)]
*  So there's a whole literature [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1389.48s)]
*  and popular books and attention. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1391.52s)]
*  We know everyone's getting a little more distracted, [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1393.44s)]
*  but all the books that talk about that say, [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1397.48s)]
*  well, this is just sort of everyday stuff. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1399.8s)]
*  This has nothing to do with ADHD. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1402.24s)]
*  And there's lots of wonderful ADHD books out there [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1405.12s)]
*  and they say ADHD is this discrete condition, [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1407.56s)]
*  even if they acknowledge it's on a spectrum of severity, [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1411.9199999999998s)]
*  but that it's really serious stuff and we don't, [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1415.2s)]
*  just because you forgot your homework [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1420.96s)]
*  or you left your car keys [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1422.6399999999999s)]
*  or you can't remember where you parked your car, [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1424.12s)]
*  everyone does that and we wanna make sure [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1426.6399999999999s)]
*  that you respect that ADHD is a serious [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1428.76s)]
*  and potentially disruptive condition. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1432.12s)]
*  And when I say serious, [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1435.16s)]
*  and I'm gonna go on this tangent for a little bit, [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1436.52s)]
*  the caricatures of ADHD is, [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1440.4s)]
*  oh, there's the squirrel. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1442.28s)]
*  It's silly, it's people are distracted, [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1444.48s)]
*  ditzy, late, doing things that we make fun of in society [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1447.2s)]
*  and we ignore that many of these things [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1453.44s)]
*  can have a more serious repercussions inside. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1456.36s)]
*  So a kid who has ADHD, [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1459.1999999999998s)]
*  their life expectancy is about 10 years shorter [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1462.32s)]
*  than their non-ADHP peers. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1465.04s)]
*  That is the same extent of cutting off life [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1466.9199999999998s)]
*  as having diabetes or having major depression. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1469.8799999999999s)]
*  Is that because of accidents, addiction, injury? [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1473.28s)]
*  Almost all of it is two factors and they're almost equally. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1477.3999999999999s)]
*  One is accidents, so motor vehicle accidents, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1481.0s)]
*  if you're driving distracted, [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1484.68s)]
*  you're more likely to be involved in accidents, [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1487.2s)]
*  but it's also the kid who's probably being more daring [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1489.48s)]
*  with the tractor on the farm or daring the bull, [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1494.8400000000001s)]
*  all sorts of accidents, not just motor vehicle accidents. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1498.16s)]
*  And the other is suicide. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1501.1200000000001s)]
*  And some of the suicide is because there is an overlap [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1503.72s)]
*  with depression and anxiety and other factors, [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1508.0s)]
*  but I'm convinced and not many people [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1510.92s)]
*  are looking at this angle somewhere. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1514.24s)]
*  With suicide, we focus so much on the despair, [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1516.76s)]
*  the misery that someone hates their life, [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1519.4s)]
*  but there's lots and lots of depressed people [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1521.8s)]
*  who don't kill themselves. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1523.8s)]
*  The other really important element to suicide [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1525.84s)]
*  is impulsivity. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1529.04s)]
*  Is lots of people feel really bad, [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1531.56s)]
*  but we know having guns in households [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1534.28s)]
*  increases the right of likelihood [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1536.92s)]
*  someone's gonna shoot them. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1538.8s)]
*  Accessibility to tools that you can quickly use [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1540.96s)]
*  to kill yourself, which shows [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1545.0s)]
*  if you slow down the thinking process, [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1548.2s)]
*  if you give people more time, [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1550.0s)]
*  if they are less impulsive, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1551.88s)]
*  they are less likely to kill them. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1553.04s)]
*  They still might be miserable. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1555.24s)]
*  And that's my explanation for why, [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1557.8400000000001s)]
*  even though during COVID lockdowns, [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1560.8400000000001s)]
*  and we did see increases in depression, [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1563.0s)]
*  we did see increases in PTSD, [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1565.76s)]
*  we did see increases in domestic abuse and battering, [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1567.4s)]
*  and we saw actually a decrease in suicide during that time. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1572.1200000000001s)]
*  How does that make any sense? [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1577.16s)]
*  And it wasn't huge, but since suicide's been going up [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1578.3200000000002s)]
*  every year prior to that, [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1581.16s)]
*  it's pretty clear and blatant in the data and remarkable. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1583.2800000000002s)]
*  And my claim is so many more people were at home, [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1587.76s)]
*  your kids not around to play with the gun or find the gun [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1590.96s)]
*  or you know what's going on, [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1594.2s)]
*  or poison or hanging themselves from the door [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1596.16s)]
*  or whatever else they might do. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1599.0s)]
*  Very interesting. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1602.0s)]
*  I didn't realize that ADHD carried this lifespan liability. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1603.0400000000002s)]
*  And 10 years is certainly significant. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1609.2s)]
*  There's also the middle ground. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1612.1200000000001s)]
*  So I sort of mentioned that the caricature [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1613.24s)]
*  is sort of the silliness and the trivial [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1615.5600000000002s)]
*  of being late for your friends at the restaurant [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1617.24s)]
*  or forgetting your car keys. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1619.68s)]
*  And the extreme is death. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1621.68s)]
*  But in between, we know ADHD measurably derails education, [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1624.32s)]
*  disrupts social relationships, [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1629.1599999999999s)]
*  impacts your likelihood of your earning potential. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1632.04s)]
*  I mean, ADHD isn't just an academic cognitive problem. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1635.2s)]
*  It isn't just who's gonna jump through the hoops [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1639.4399999999998s)]
*  and get through school. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1641.36s)]
*  It isn't just who's turning in their reports [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1642.52s)]
*  or doing their work on time in the work. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1644.72s)]
*  It's also having social implications. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1648.6s)]
*  And in all of those areas, [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1650.76s)]
*  it's having measurable detrimental significant impacts [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1652.96s)]
*  on people's lives. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1657.04s)]
*  My understanding, [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1659.36s)]
*  and you'll see how this weaves into the previous question [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1660.8799999999999s)]
*  in a moment. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1664.44s)]
*  My understanding is that people with ADHD [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1665.28s)]
*  have the ability to focus quite intensely [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1669.12s)]
*  on things that really capture their interest. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1671.44s)]
*  I don't know if I have ADHD or not. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1674.8799999999999s)]
*  I suspect if I do, it's rather mild [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1677.12s)]
*  or I just feel lucky that I went [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1679.36s)]
*  through the educational system at a time [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1682.8s)]
*  when there were no smartphones. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1684.76s)]
*  I'm really grateful for that. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1687.08s)]
*  I actually used to unplug the phone in the laboratory [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1688.6799999999998s)]
*  where I was a PhD student [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1690.8s)]
*  so that I could just do experiments from 5 p.m. on [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1692.52s)]
*  because that was the only way people could reach me. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1694.7199999999998s)]
*  And I certainly am familiar with the, [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1696.1999999999998s)]
*  it's almost a drug-like effect of dropping into an activity. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1699.4799999999998s)]
*  Sometimes people call it flow, [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1705.1599999999999s)]
*  but for me, it just is dropping into an activity, [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1706.6s)]
*  and I did some early morning writing this morning, [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1709.9599999999998s)]
*  and gosh, the feeling of pleasure just everywhere [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1712.12s)]
*  from head to toe after doing 20 minutes of focused work [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1715.76s)]
*  or 30 minutes of focused work is so striking to me. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1719.28s)]
*  And yet I like, I think most people find it difficult [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1723.2399999999998s)]
*  sometimes to just get rid of all the distractions [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1726.9199999999998s)]
*  unless there's a deadline, [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1728.9599999999998s)]
*  which is one of the reasons I love deadlines. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1730.04s)]
*  So the question is this, [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1731.84s)]
*  is it true that people with ADHD can in fact focus, [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1733.76s)]
*  whatever neural or neurochemical thresholds are there [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1737.76s)]
*  to allow them to drop into focus, [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1741.8799999999999s)]
*  they're just much higher thresholds. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1744.44s)]
*  It just takes more fear of a deadline [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1745.8799999999999s)]
*  or fear of a consequence or excitement about the activity. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1748.08s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1752.2s)]
*  Yeah, so I'll back up a little bit, [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1754.0s)]
*  and I maybe should have said this [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1755.8s)]
*  when we were talking about diagnosis and what is ADHD. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1757.12s)]
*  And many people think it's a horrible title [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1759.8s)]
*  because it focuses on attention deficit [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1762.72s)]
*  hyperactivity disorder, [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1764.84s)]
*  and it's very clear as you're enumerating here, [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1766.76s)]
*  it's not a deficit of attention. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1769.76s)]
*  If it's a deficit at all, [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1771.64s)]
*  it's a deficit of control over attention. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1773.0s)]
*  And with attention, there's at least three different realms [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1776.16s)]
*  where we're controlling it. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1779.12s)]
*  I mean, one is we direct attention. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1781.0s)]
*  So if something's important going on over there, there, [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1782.8799999999999s)]
*  so we have to be able to shift it. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1785.44s)]
*  Two, you have to be able to sustain it. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1787.24s)]
*  So if it's a situation that's appropriate [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1790.04s)]
*  to be sustaining it. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1792.8s)]
*  And three is you need to shift out of it [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1794.44s)]
*  if it's inappropriate to stay in it. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1798.24s)]
*  And in all three of those realms, [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1800.4s)]
*  people with ADHD have less volitional control [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1803.3600000000001s)]
*  over their attention. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1807.3600000000001s)]
*  So many people in the ADHD who experience it [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1809.16s)]
*  describe hyperfocus as one of their superpowers. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1812.16s)]
*  And that is where they're getting so absorbed in their work [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1815.0800000000002s)]
*  that they are so busy coding [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1818.6000000000001s)]
*  that actually everyone else in the office is left [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1821.6000000000001s)]
*  and it's only when the janitor is coming [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1824.96s)]
*  and emptying the garbage cans at 11 p.m. that they say, [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1826.28s)]
*  oh my God, where is everyone? [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1828.32s)]
*  I'm still here because I was so intently working [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1830.32s)]
*  on the project. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1833.2s)]
*  Some people strongly resist the idea that flow [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1834.92s)]
*  and I'm gonna butcher the check, check. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1838.88s)]
*  No, Chikso-Mahai. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1841.76s)]
*  Yeah, no one can pronounce his name. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1843.6000000000001s)]
*  Even fewer can spell it, so we're okay. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1845.44s)]
*  My reading of, when I sort of delved into this, [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1847.8s)]
*  I think hyperfocus is exactly a flow state [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1851.4s)]
*  because people are describing the same lack of awareness [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1854.44s)]
*  of time and it's always, [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1857.76s)]
*  I mean it's a task that's somewhat challenging [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1861.8000000000002s)]
*  and engaging and interesting. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1864.2800000000002s)]
*  It's not just that if it were just about enjoyment or bliss, [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1865.52s)]
*  you could hyperfocus looking at a beautiful flower. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1869.48s)]
*  People don't describe that. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1874.4s)]
*  So it needs the right amount of challenge. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1876.52s)]
*  It can't be too easy, it can't be too hard. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1878.6000000000001s)]
*  It has to be something important and interesting to you. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1882.08s)]
*  It involves oblivion not just to time, [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1885.68s)]
*  but also to lots of space going around you. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1888.56s)]
*  So I think they are pretty close, [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1894.32s)]
*  if not the same phenomena, flow and hyperfocus. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1896.84s)]
*  And some people with ADHD, and I think some are ones [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1901.6s)]
*  who learn what situational factors or what internal factors [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1905.64s)]
*  can help get them into that state, [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1910.2s)]
*  but many of them still struggle at showing up [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1912.32s)]
*  when they don't want to be hyperfocused on something [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1916.88s)]
*  or have trouble engaging it when it would be useful to. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1919.56s)]
*  I sometimes use the absent-minded professor excuse, [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1923.32s)]
*  but only half jokingly. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1926.88s)]
*  There's a photograph that I love of the great Oliver Sacks, [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1928.96s)]
*  the neurologist turned writer, [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1932.48s)]
*  man who mistook his wife for his hat, [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1935.6000000000001s)]
*  awakenings and so forth. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1937.16s)]
*  People may be familiar with Oliver's work. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1938.76s)]
*  And it's a photograph of Oliver at a train station, [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1941.4s)]
*  lots of bodies moving around him, some blurry, [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1944.68s)]
*  so there's motion there. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1949.08s)]
*  And he's standing there with, [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1950.56s)]
*  I think he's got his pipe in his mouth [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1953.08s)]
*  and he's writing outside the train station. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1955.48s)]
*  His bag has fallen to the floor, some items are coming out. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1958.68s)]
*  And he was a known and self-professed methamphetamine addict [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1962.24s)]
*  for a great portion of his medical and writing career. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1966.4s)]
*  And sort of alluded to the idea that he had these tendencies. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1972.16s)]
*  And I raise this as an example, because I see that photo [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1977.2s)]
*  and I see somebody who's in hyper-focus [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1980.6000000000001s)]
*  in a very busy environment, but he wrote, [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1982.72s)]
*  I've spent a long time with his work [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1987.1200000000001s)]
*  and his autobiography, et cetera, [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1988.3200000000002s)]
*  and talked to people who knew him. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1990.76s)]
*  And it seemed that he was constantly seeking [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1992.6000000000001s)]
*  novel environments where there was a lot of stimulation [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1994.68s)]
*  and somehow that allowed him to drop [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1998.4s)]
*  into these tunnels of focus. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2000.28s)]
*  Whereas when he spent a lot of time alone, [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2002.3600000000001s)]
*  there were bouts of focus, [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2004.96s)]
*  but the quiet actually became a distraction. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2006.96s)]
*  It was as if somebody in here were speculating [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2009.72s)]
*  about diagnoses, but that there's something [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2013.3600000000001s)]
*  about external anchors and internal anchors. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2015.68s)]
*  And that finding that sweet spot [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2017.88s)]
*  is really about knowing ourselves [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2020.28s)]
*  and where we work best at particular times. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2021.72s)]
*  And this is something I'd like to transition into here [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2024.88s)]
*  is talking about the fact that there isn't [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2027.04s)]
*  just one environment that works for somebody. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2030.2s)]
*  It seems like it's often the case [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2032.92s)]
*  that it's certain environments for morning, [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2034.32s)]
*  certain environments for afternoon, [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2036.44s)]
*  certain environments having returned from vacation. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2037.96s)]
*  You can probably see where I'm going with this. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2042.2s)]
*  What are your thoughts on people trying to, [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2043.96s)]
*  with ADHD or not, trying to identify [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2046.24s)]
*  best conditions for them? [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2051.2000000000003s)]
*  And how important is circadian time here? [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2053.1200000000003s)]
*  I know you have, and of course I mentioned [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2056.52s)]
*  in the introduction that you have a lot of background [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2058.52s)]
*  in circadian biology, which I think brings in [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2060.7200000000003s)]
*  a really additional and unique dynamic [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2063.48s)]
*  to your understanding of ADHD. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2065.84s)]
*  So many people come to me as a psychiatrist for ADHD [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2068.28s)]
*  are primarily focused on medications. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2071.44s)]
*  And we still know that the stimulants [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2074.04s)]
*  are the single most powerful, [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2075.76s)]
*  in terms of extent of symptom reduction overall [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2079.48s)]
*  and in terms of the percentage of people they help, [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2082.6s)]
*  they're our most potent tool. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2084.88s)]
*  I mean, the medicine's not gonna change everything [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2087.28s)]
*  and you need to be focusing on your life as well. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2089.68s)]
*  And I always start with scheduling. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2092.56s)]
*  And many people with ADHD find scheduling anathema, [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2095.12s)]
*  but that's like the slaves on the galley ship [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2099.12s)]
*  being told that you have to row, stroke, stroke, stroke. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2103.16s)]
*  And what I tell them is that the part of you [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2107.24s)]
*  that's gonna help make the schedule that works for you [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2111.04s)]
*  isn't some evil taskmaster trying to make you do [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2114.24s)]
*  what you don't wanna do. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2117.6s)]
*  It's actually the wisest, smartest, nicest, [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2119.3199999999997s)]
*  kindest part of you that's identified [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2121.9599999999996s)]
*  what are your lifetime, what are your bigger goals? [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2124.3599999999997s)]
*  How are we gonna match what you're doing in the minute [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2127.3599999999997s)]
*  to line up with those bigger goals? [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2129.7999999999997s)]
*  And this analogy isn't perfect, [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2132.7599999999998s)]
*  but the best one I've come up with, [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2134.2s)]
*  so rather than the guy on the Viking ship, [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2135.44s)]
*  the person, you, the part of you [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2138.92s)]
*  that's making your schedule is a mother hen [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2141.2400000000002s)]
*  who's sort of counting all the chicks [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2144.76s)]
*  and making things aligned and nestling down [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2146.48s)]
*  and hunkering around you and taking care of you [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2149.84s)]
*  and nurturing you. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2152.52s)]
*  And with scheduling, what I tell people [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2154.64s)]
*  is before you slot in your work or your homework [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2156.88s)]
*  or your school or externally derived tasks, [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2159.88s)]
*  I tell people you need to have the four basics. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2166.2000000000003s)]
*  And sleep is far and away the biggest basic, [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2168.8s)]
*  particularly for, it's essential for all of us, [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2172.0s)]
*  but it's particularly critical for ADHD [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2175.16s)]
*  and there's particular reasons [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2177.28s)]
*  why it's a particular challenge for people with ADHD. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2179.36s)]
*  But I'm trying to think if I can imagine a counterexample, [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2183.2400000000002s)]
*  I would say all the successful people I know with ADHD [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2186.48s)]
*  have found some way to try to regularize their sleep [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2190.2400000000002s)]
*  compared to what it would be if they were just. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2193.28s)]
*  So the four essentials I say are sleep, eating, [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2195.52s)]
*  exercise or some amount of movement, [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2199.1600000000003s)]
*  because again with the hyperactivity, [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2200.92s)]
*  there's people who can sit at a desk for 12 hours, [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2202.32s)]
*  not even getting up for a bathroom break [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2207.0800000000004s)]
*  or to eat or anything. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2209.44s)]
*  That's not just bad, I mean, [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2210.84s)]
*  that's bad for your brain, bad for your body. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2213.5600000000004s)]
*  And then the fourth thing I put in is [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2215.6800000000003s)]
*  a miscellaneous category of me time, relaxation, meditation, [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2219.0s)]
*  I put all those in the same slot, maybe they shouldn't, [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2223.76s)]
*  and all those need to be in place. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2226.6000000000004s)]
*  We can talk more about sleep, [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2230.28s)]
*  but I'll just say a little bit more about the eating component. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2231.8s)]
*  One of my, so we have our diagnostic criteria for ADHD, [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2234.32s)]
*  but I had over the years two different real life tests. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2238.32s)]
*  The office I had was an old Victorian home, [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2243.52s)]
*  so it was a home office. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2246.6000000000004s)]
*  The office itself was at the entrance, [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2247.52s)]
*  was at the end of a short but very steep driveway, [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2249.48s)]
*  so it was a separate door. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2252.8s)]
*  And I would always explain to every new patient [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2254.84s)]
*  the exact same thing, you know, [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2258.96s)]
*  there's a house at 45 Hartford, [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2261.0s)]
*  the office is at 45A, [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2263.6000000000004s)]
*  the entrance is at the end of the driveway, [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2265.0s)]
*  and I actually did the data on it. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2267.84s)]
*  The only people who ever showed up at the front door, [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2273.2400000000002s)]
*  the home door, were the people with ADHD. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2276.28s)]
*  Now everyone, it wasn't specific for ADHD, [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2278.44s)]
*  it wasn't completely sensitive, [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2282.88s)]
*  so some of the ADHD people got it right, [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2284.2400000000002s)]
*  but never did anyone who was coming in for OCD or depression [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2286.84s)]
*  or PTSD show up at the front door. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2290.36s)]
*  And I gave the instructions at the same time, [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2293.48s)]
*  and sometimes I didn't know beforehand [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2295.04s)]
*  that the person was coming in for ADHD [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2298.48s)]
*  because they didn't know, [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2300.08s)]
*  but if they showed up at the front door, [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2301.0s)]
*  that always made me, you know, [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2302.92s)]
*  uh-oh, I better make sure I ask specific detailed questions [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2305.36s)]
*  about the ADHD possible component. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2310.6000000000004s)]
*  So the other sort of real life diagnostic test I had, [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2312.76s)]
*  if someone during the evaluation would say something like, [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2316.56s)]
*  or in a subsequent session, [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2320.2000000000003s)]
*  oh, it was four o'clock yesterday, [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2322.04s)]
*  and I just realized I hadn't eaten all day. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2323.6000000000004s)]
*  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, that's, I mean, [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2327.28s)]
*  I have people who died, [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2329.6000000000004s)]
*  I have people who have fasting regimens or others, [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2330.6800000000003s)]
*  but they're not forgetting to eat. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2334.68s)]
*  And it's not that everyone at the ADHD does that, [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2337.3999999999996s)]
*  but either, either not getting the right [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2339.64s)]
*  intero-receptive cues from your body [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2341.56s)]
*  or not paying attention to them [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2344.7599999999998s)]
*  is something that's been measurable in people with ADHD. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2346.96s)]
*  So having a regular meal schedule. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2351.3199999999997s)]
*  So having a regular meal schedule, [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2353.0s)]
*  and again, getting back to the COVID in workplace. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2354.64s)]
*  If you're, you know, I had lots of people in tech [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2357.12s)]
*  who really lamented, now I have to work for home, [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2360.7599999999998s)]
*  they were giving me lunch, [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2364.28s)]
*  a healthy, nice lunch each day at work. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2365.36s)]
*  They're scrambling to even use the home, [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2367.76s)]
*  you know, meal delivery systems, [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2371.44s)]
*  because getting that organized and set up [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2372.92s)]
*  is just too overwhelming for them. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2376.0800000000004s)]
*  And again, these are bright people [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2377.6400000000003s)]
*  who are succeeding in most parts of their life. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2380.28s)]
*  Are these people with ADHD sometimes also starting a meal, [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2382.88s)]
*  taking a few bites, and then going back to work, [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2387.32s)]
*  and then like the meal never really, never really ends. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2389.28s)]
*  It just sort of fragments into the rest of the day. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2392.32s)]
*  That can be one variation. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2395.52s)]
*  But it's often just completely forgetting [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2397.84s)]
*  or being oblivious to it. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2401.0800000000004s)]
*  I mean, the other ways ADHD can play a role [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2402.44s)]
*  is I was meaning to have breakfast before I left the house, [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2405.88s)]
*  but always when it's time to leave the house, [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2409.1600000000003s)]
*  you forget that you hadn't done this, [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2412.6000000000004s)]
*  and the kids' shoes need to be tied, [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2414.8s)]
*  and oh, do I need a new toothbrush? [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2417.28s)]
*  I better go check upstairs before I go out [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2420.2s)]
*  because I'm going to the CVS store. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2422.48s)]
*  I mean, time management is a problem with ADHD, [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2425.56s)]
*  an executive function problem. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2429.52s)]
*  Interestingly, it's not one of the 18 symptoms [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2431.3999999999996s)]
*  in our official checklist. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2434.96s)]
*  So our official checklist is sort of a crude clinical attempt [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2436.48s)]
*  to map out a lot of the aspects of ADHD, but it misses a lot. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2441.2799999999997s)]
*  So there's emotional regulation problems we know, [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2445.9199999999996s)]
*  something like 60% of people with ADHD [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2449.56s)]
*  acknowledge that emotions explode [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2452.84s)]
*  or come up bigger or stronger and are harder to regulate, [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2456.36s)]
*  and that's nowhere acknowledged [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2460.36s)]
*  in our official diagnostic symptomatology. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2462.16s)]
*  I'd like to take a quick break and thank our sponsor, AG1. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2466.16s)]
*  AG1 is an all-in-one vitamin mineral probiotic drink [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2469.64s)]
*  with adaptogens. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2473.0s)]
*  I've been taking AG1 daily since 2012, [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2474.12s)]
*  so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring this podcast. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2477.04s)]
*  The reason I started taking AG1 [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2479.52s)]
*  and the reason I still take AG1 [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2481.24s)]
*  is because it is the highest quality [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2482.96s)]
*  and most complete foundational nutritional supplement. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2484.48s)]
*  What that means is that AG1 ensures [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2487.36s)]
*  that you're getting all the necessary vitamins, [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2489.36s)]
*  minerals, and other micronutrients [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2491.6s)]
*  to form a strong foundation for your daily health. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2493.48s)]
*  AG1 also has probiotics and prebiotics [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2496.16s)]
*  that support a healthy gut microbiome. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2498.8s)]
*  Your gut microbiome consists of trillions of microorganisms [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2500.76s)]
*  that line your digestive tract [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2503.76s)]
*  and impact things such as your immune system status, [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2505.48s)]
*  your metabolic health, your hormone health, and much more. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2507.88s)]
*  So I've consistently found that when I take AG1 daily, [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2510.88s)]
*  my digestion is improved, my immune system is more robust, [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2513.88s)]
*  and my mood and mental focus are at their best. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2517.08s)]
*  In fact, if I could take just one supplement, [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2519.68s)]
*  that supplement would be AG1. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2521.88s)]
*  If you'd like to try AG1, [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2524.08s)]

*  plus a year's supply of vitamin D3K2 [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2531.68s)]
*  with your order of AG1. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2534.64s)]
*  Again, go to drinkag1.com slash Huberman [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2536.2s)]
*  to claim the special offer. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2539.52s)]
*  So we've got sleep, eating, exercise, [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2541.88s)]
*  or movement and relaxation. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2545.16s)]
*  Maybe before we start talking about some medications [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2547.52s)]
*  and some other factors that modulate ADHD, [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2551.12s)]
*  if we could maybe step through each of those [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2553.88s)]
*  and you could share with us some of your favorite tools [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2555.72s)]
*  that you give your patients and that you teach online. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2559.08s)]
*  Realizing, of course, that each one of those [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2564.92s)]
*  is a vast topic that we could do entire, [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2566.68s)]
*  we have done entire podcasts on, [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2568.72s)]
*  but I'm curious about your favorite go-to tools. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2570.36s)]
*  We were talking about a few of these before we started. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2575.0s)]
*  So sleep, regular to bed and wake up times? [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2577.08s)]
*  Matthew Walker in his great book on sleep, [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2581.92s)]
*  one of my favorite things about it [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2584.7599999999998s)]
*  is he really emphasizes this point [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2586.96s)]
*  that quality sleep isn't just about eight hours. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2588.88s)]
*  It isn't just duration. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2592.16s)]
*  It's getting quality sleep. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2593.6s)]
*  And the timing of your sleep [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2595.72s)]
*  is every bit as important as the duration. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2597.36s)]
*  So if you're used to sleeping midnight to 8 a.m. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2599.16s)]
*  and you're staying up dancing or partying until 4 a.m. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2602.36s)]
*  and you say, oh, it's a weekend, I can sleep until noon, [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2606.36s)]
*  you may still get those eight hours, [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2609.48s)]
*  but they're not restorative to the same extent [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2611.0s)]
*  as if you had slept at your regular time. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2613.7999999999997s)]
*  And my PhD research was on circadian rhythms. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2616.2s)]
*  We had realms of data back then, [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2620.96s)]
*  so this was 40, 30 plus years ago. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2623.92s)]
*  We had every bit as much data then [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2628.52s)]
*  that the timing of sleep is as important as the duration, [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2630.32s)]
*  and yet every public service announcement just says, [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2633.52s)]
*  get your eight hours of sleep. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2636.28s)]
*  Why are we leaving out this other piece? [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2638.96s)]
*  We've known for decades that people with ADHD [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2641.76s)]
*  have a strong propensity to being night owls, [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2644.44s)]
*  to have a different chronotype [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2647.2400000000002s)]
*  where they're maybe more effective or functional [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2649.12s)]
*  later in the day, a tendency to stay up. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2651.6s)]
*  For many years now, we've actually known [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2654.3199999999997s)]
*  that this is strongly genetically controlled, [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2656.92s)]
*  so we do have, you know, there are genetic markers [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2660.08s)]
*  affecting sleep timing that are overrepresented strongly [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2663.3599999999997s)]
*  in the ADHD community, so some of it is your push that way, [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2667.0s)]
*  but some of it is the nature of ADHD, [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2671.3199999999997s)]
*  that if you, you know, procrastinating is part of ADHD. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2673.3599999999997s)]
*  If you procrastinate, you're gonna push things off [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2676.68s)]
*  till the end of the day. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2679.12s)]
*  Some people, the end of the day is a better time to work [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2681.0s)]
*  because there's fewer distractions. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2684.96s)]
*  You know, if everyone else is asleep finally, [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2686.3599999999997s)]
*  no one's gonna come in and interrupt your work [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2688.64s)]
*  or ask what your thoughts on this project are, [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2690.7599999999998s)]
*  but again, getting regular sleep, [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2694.3199999999997s)]
*  and regular and sufficient doesn't mean it has to be [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2696.72s)]
*  what I'd say normal. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2701.16s)]
*  You know, if it works for you, if you can build your career [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2702.16s)]
*  and your social life around sleeping from 2 a.m. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2704.88s)]
*  till 10 a.m. every day, I'd say go for it [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2708.12s)]
*  if you can be consistent with it. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2711.44s)]
*  So what are the things that help with getting regular sleep? [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2714.88s)]
*  One thing paradoxically for many people [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2718.28s)]
*  is actually being on stimulant medications. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2720.7200000000003s)]
*  So stimulants do have, as a side effect, [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2723.44s)]
*  some people have insomnia, some people stay up later, [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2726.28s)]
*  but more people with ADHD tend to, [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2729.6800000000003s)]
*  either because the drug is wearing off at the end of the day [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2733.44s)]
*  and there's some crash in alertness or energy, [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2736.2400000000002s)]
*  or because they're being more productively expanding energy [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2739.32s)]
*  and are more tired at the end of the day, [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2742.84s)]
*  or it's just helping synchronize circadian clocks [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2744.4s)]
*  by getting a consistent start early in the day. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2747.8s)]
*  We don't know the mechanism by which it works. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2750.28s)]
*  There's lots of plausible and overlapping ones, [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2754.08s)]
*  but again, daytime alertness medications can help. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2756.2000000000003s)]
*  Can I run something by you in that context [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2760.7999999999997s)]
*  before we jump back? [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2762.7999999999997s)]
*  I don't consistently take stimulants except caffeine [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2765.2s)]
*  and I limit my caffeine intake to prior to 2 p.m. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2768.8399999999997s)]
*  and I stack it pretty heavy in the early part of the day. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2771.56s)]
*  But on occasion, I'll take 25 to 50 milligrams of Welbutrin, [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2775.04s)]
*  which as you know better than I is slightly dopaminergic, [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2782.8799999999997s)]
*  but certainly triggers noradrenergic release. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2786.8399999999997s)]
*  So epinephrine, norepinephrine, it's a stimulant. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2789.84s)]
*  On the days when I take that, which again is very rare, [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2794.48s)]
*  and I track my sleep every night, [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2797.6000000000004s)]
*  I notice a significant improvement in my sleep [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2801.56s)]
*  and significant increase in my rapid eye movement sleep. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2805.28s)]
*  It's extremely consistent. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2808.4s)]
*  So from that, I sort of reverse engineered [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2809.88s)]
*  the major effect being norepinephrine. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2814.28s)]
*  Epinephrine, I decided, well, I would do something else [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2816.48s)]
*  that I know raises epinephrine, [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2820.48s)]
*  which is I'll do a cold plunge first thing in the morning [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2821.3199999999997s)]
*  of one to three minutes long. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2823.8799999999997s)]
*  And the effect isn't quite as strong, [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2825.7999999999997s)]
*  but on those same days when I do that, [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2828.4s)]
*  clearly adrenaline raising activity, [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2831.2s)]
*  I also see a, for me, a significant increase [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2833.3599999999997s)]
*  in my rapid eye movement sleep [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2836.92s)]
*  and the quality of sleep later that night. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2839.08s)]
*  So I think there really is something to this epinephrine, [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2840.68s)]
*  obviously going hand in hand with stimulants. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2845.12s)]
*  Epinephrine spike early and throughout the day [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2848.48s)]
*  with better rapid eye movement sleep at night. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2852.32s)]
*  Does that logically hold for you? [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2855.0s)]
*  It's just a story, but you know. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2856.92s)]
*  I was gonna say, as both of us have some science background, [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2858.4s)]
*  so I'd say I'm glad it works. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2862.4s)]
*  And what's hard to sorting out is why it's working, [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2865.32s)]
*  is one is potential placebo effect. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2868.08s)]
*  You're doing it because you're thinking [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2870.72s)]
*  or hoping it works, good. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2872.36s)]
*  And two, I'd say maybe even more importantly [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2874.76s)]
*  than the placebo effect is the days [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2877.72s)]
*  that you're deciding to do this, [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2879.68s)]
*  there's something different about those days to begin with [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2881.2s)]
*  because they're not doing it every day. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2883.48s)]
*  So those potential issues aside, [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2885.2799999999997s)]
*  I'll jump into insomnia. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2892.3599999999997s)]
*  And Matthew Walker talks about some of this. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2895.2799999999997s)]
*  To me, maybe the biggest finding [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2897.7999999999997s)]
*  in insomnia sleep medicine in the last 20 years [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2899.68s)]
*  is that almost everyone who has a problem with insomnia [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2903.12s)]
*  doesn't have a problem with sleep. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2907.48s)]
*  Huh, what? [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2909.68s)]
*  That doesn't sound like I'm contradicting myself. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2910.52s)]
*  What I mean is the sleep system's intact, it's there, [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2912.72s)]
*  it's waiting to arrive and put you to sleep each night. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2916.68s)]
*  What the problem, and this is from the sleep researchers, [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2920.36s)]
*  with at least 90% or probably more of people [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2924.44s)]
*  who have insomnia problems is the failure [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2927.2400000000002s)]
*  of the daytime arousal system to shut off properly. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2929.36s)]
*  So normally we have these two mutually inhibitory systems, [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2932.4s)]
*  a wakefulness arousal system and a sleep sedation system. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2936.8s)]
*  And usually when one turns on, the other turns off. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2942.28s)]
*  And with most people's problem with insomnia, [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2945.2000000000003s)]
*  it isn't that sleep is weak or insufficient or not there. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2948.6400000000003s)]
*  It's sitting, it's waiting there. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2951.88s)]
*  It just can't land on the landing pad [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2953.0800000000004s)]
*  because you're too aroused or too awake. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2955.1200000000003s)]
*  I mean, maybe that helps the arousal system [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2958.04s)]
*  to turn off better at the end of the day [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2961.2000000000003s)]
*  if it's gotten more fully engaged during the day. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2962.8s)]
*  I don't know, but it feeds back more [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2966.08s)]
*  into some of the non-medication approaches [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2968.12s)]
*  to helping with sleep, and that is doing everything you can, [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2970.52s)]
*  again, not just to force sleep or push it [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2974.68s)]
*  because that doesn't work very well, [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2977.92s)]
*  it's getting rid of arousal, it's dampening arousal. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2979.24s)]
*  So for people with ADHD, one is deciding on [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2982.72s)]
*  what's a reasonable bedtime, [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2986.44s)]
*  having, thinking about this ahead of time, [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2988.12s)]
*  and two, eliminating any stimulation, [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2991.6s)]
*  or I mean, one, so exercise, I'm a big fan of. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2997.0s)]
*  I'm a marathon runner. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2999.8399999999997s)]
*  I know you're heavily into exercise as well. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3001.56s)]
*  Exercising too late in the evening [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3005.88s)]
*  can elevate body temperature, disrupt falling asleep. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3008.2799999999997s)]
*  So physical arousal, we don't want to be doing a lot of [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3011.48s)]
*  late in the day, and emotional, intellectually, [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3015.96s)]
*  cognitive arousal. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3019.8399999999997s)]
*  So the biggest single tool in modern life [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3021.24s)]
*  is do not have your phone in your bedroom, [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3025.3199999999997s)]
*  and that's hard for lots of people to do, [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3029.8799999999997s)]
*  but if it's there, you're gonna be checking it. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3032.0s)]
*  I mean, studies have even shown, [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3035.3999999999996s)]
*  even if you're not checking it, [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3036.68s)]
*  if it's there, you're thinking about it, [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3037.8399999999997s)]
*  they're looking at it, just having it away, [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3039.7999999999997s)]
*  out of sight is better than having it [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3042.2799999999997s)]
*  visible and turned off. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3044.68s)]
*  Two is using, if you have someone you're sharing a bed with, [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3046.8799999999997s)]
*  your family members, using them to help reinforce, [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3050.92s)]
*  yes, and it's really helpful to talk about this [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3054.2400000000002s)]
*  ahead of time, because the exact same words [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3057.8s)]
*  can either be sounding like a nag, [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3060.6s)]
*  or someone trying to exert their power over you, [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3062.7200000000003s)]
*  rather than what people with ADHD, we know, need reminders. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3066.36s)]
*  They know they need some of that external structure, [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3070.4s)]
*  and if you are on the same page and can have a partner, [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3073.64s)]
*  your kid, or someone else present, [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3077.7200000000003s)]
*  hey, Dad, shouldn't you be turning off the computer [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3080.12s)]
*  and heading to bed right now? [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3082.12s)]
*  That can be helpful. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3084.12s)]
*  Again, it can be destructive if it's not done [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3085.28s)]
*  in a framework where both people are on board, [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3087.64s)]
*  and it's not fair to make the other person [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3090.56s)]
*  responsible for your own behavior, [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3092.96s)]
*  but lots of people are usually happy to help the person [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3095.12s)]
*  with ADHD be more organized in their life. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3099.2s)]
*  So we were also talking a little bit before, [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3102.4s)]
*  one of my favorite tools for falling asleep [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3104.6s)]
*  is actually cyclic sighing. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3106.8s)]
*  I mean, there are other box breathing and other techniques [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3108.32s)]
*  to help someone relax. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3111.04s)]
*  So we know cyclic sighing engages [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3113.0s)]
*  a parasympathetic nervous system, [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3115.6800000000003s)]
*  a rest and digest system. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3117.4s)]
*  I mean, one of the things that happens normally [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3119.4s)]
*  in the transition every night when you fall asleep [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3121.7200000000003s)]
*  is you're going from primarily sympathetic tone [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3124.6400000000003s)]
*  to primarily parasympathetic tone. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3127.6000000000004s)]
*  So anything that is strengthening [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3129.36s)]
*  or putting you there already makes it easier. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3131.76s)]
*  I know you have videos about cyclic sighing, [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3136.0s)]
*  I do too. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3138.2400000000002s)]
*  I mean, my own experience which I was sharing with you [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3139.08s)]
*  before we started talking was not only does cyclic sighing [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3142.56s)]
*  help me fall asleep better, [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3145.7200000000003s)]
*  it actually helped me stay asleep [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3147.1200000000003s)]
*  throughout the night better. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3148.8s)]
*  That's a remarkable thing because many people, [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3150.2000000000003s)]
*  including myself, have very little trouble falling asleep, [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3152.7200000000003s)]
*  especially given how I stack caffeine [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3156.36s)]
*  in the early part of the day and then stop in the afternoon. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3157.92s)]
*  It allows me to fall asleep within seconds somewhere [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3161.48s)]
*  for me typically around 10 p.m., [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3166.48s)]
*  somewhere between 10 and 11 p.m. is my typical bedtime. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3168.4s)]
*  But then I consistently wake up at three in the morning, [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3171.2400000000002s)]
*  usually get up, use the restroom and then go back to sleep, [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3176.52s)]
*  most of the time without too much trouble [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3179.66s)]
*  provided there isn't a lot of stress in my external life [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3181.52s)]
*  and provided the phone is not in the bedroom. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3184.2s)]
*  But as we were also talking about [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3187.7400000000002s)]
*  before we turned on the microphones, [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3189.28s)]
*  this idea that our bladders get smaller as we age [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3192.72s)]
*  is complete nonsense, right? [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3196.2s)]
*  So that can't be the explanation why people wake up [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3197.72s)]
*  more in the middle of the night as they get older. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3200.68s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, some might, [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3202.7799999999997s)]
*  I mean, some it may be a prostate issue. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3204.8799999999997s)]
*  Clearly that isn't accounting for half the population, [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3208.16s)]
*  but I think it's much more the neurologic innervation [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3210.3999999999996s)]
*  of our bladder, all our nerves start functioning [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3213.6s)]
*  not quite as well. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3217.54s)]
*  And they're just getting the signal [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3219.4399999999996s)]
*  that I really need to urinate right now [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3221.18s)]
*  when pretty clearly most of those people don't, [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3223.16s)]
*  they could wait, but the signal is arriving [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3226.92s)]
*  that says you have to and it's believable [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3229.2s)]
*  and you don't wanna deal with it if it's, [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3231.2s)]
*  you don't wanna not listen to it if it is right. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3234.24s)]
*  How much cyclic sighing are you doing before sleep [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3237.08s)]
*  and how long before sleep is the cyclic sighing done? [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3239.24s)]
*  So when I read your paper with Spiegel and others January, [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3242.48s)]
*  for years I've said I don't have a meditation practice, [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3246.74s)]
*  most people think I'm sort of so chill or relaxed [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3250.12s)]
*  that I do. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3253.96s)]
*  You seem like a pretty mellow dude. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3254.7999999999997s)]
*  I haven't ever taken the time to do it, [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3256.04s)]
*  which I'm embarrassed by. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3258.56s)]
*  So I said, read the paper, [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3260.04s)]
*  I can do five minutes a day of cyclic sighing. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3262.3199999999997s)]
*  And I tried and it was some days I was getting it in [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3265.84s)]
*  and many days I wasn't getting it until bedtime, [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3270.2s)]
*  which is the, I slept really well till I was around 40 [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3272.92s)]
*  and not so well the next 20 years, [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3278.0s)]
*  both mostly with the trouble of falling asleep, [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3280.48s)]
*  even though I knew of relaxation techniques and others. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3283.16s)]
*  So I wound up just consistently doing it [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3286.2s)]
*  to do it more for the general health [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3289.12s)]
*  and I do have slightly elevated blood pressure [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3291.2400000000002s)]
*  and relaxation and to see what effect it would have [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3294.32s)]
*  and it was clear. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3296.96s)]
*  So I do about five minutes and much more than five minutes, [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3298.82s)]
*  I tell people and I might be doing it [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3303.52s)]
*  a little slower than most, [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3306.52s)]
*  count out about 20 or 25 reps of it. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3307.76s)]
*  And if you lose track, doesn't matter, [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3310.76s)]
*  just go back to the lowest number [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3314.6400000000003s)]
*  because again, everything we're trying to do [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3316.0800000000004s)]
*  is decrease arousal. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3317.8s)]
*  If you have a timer on it and you do it for five minutes [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3319.5200000000004s)]
*  and then you're woken up, [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3322.36s)]
*  you're reversing or mitigating [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3323.76s)]
*  some of the benefit of doing it. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3325.5200000000004s)]
*  So my recommendation is do it for five minutes about, [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3327.84s)]
*  but do it by counting reps and don't focus [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3332.5200000000004s)]
*  on whether if it's six minutes, if it's four. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3336.48s)]
*  I mean, there's so many aspects of this [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3339.2s)]
*  and we know the exhalation has to be longer. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3341.92s)]
*  I was trying to find, [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3345.02s)]
*  is anyone systematically, [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3346.52s)]
*  is a four second exhalation better than 10 versus six? [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3348.4s)]
*  And those studies would be so simplistic and easy to do, [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3352.32s)]
*  but there's lots of variables that we can play with [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3355.28s)]
*  to see what's optimal. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3357.88s)]
*  I don't think we know at all what's optimal, [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3358.84s)]
*  but we know what's good enough to work. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3361.32s)]
*  Delighted to hear that it's worked so well for you. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3364.32s)]
*  As people know, I'm a huge fan of the physiological sigh [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3366.96s)]
*  and I take no credit for having discovered it. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3369.52s)]
*  It was discovered by physiologists in the 1930s. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3371.52s)]
*  So throughout the data point that I shared with you [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3373.88s)]
*  is that prior to tricyclic sighing at nighttime, [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3376.0s)]
*  I was waking up virtually every single night, [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3381.92s)]
*  once a night to urinate. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3384.44s)]
*  And in the 18 months, 20 months since I've been doing it, [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3385.96s)]
*  I think it's been a total of four times [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3390.32s)]
*  that I've woken up during the night to urinate. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3392.12s)]
*  Fantastic. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3394.96s)]
*  So we're talking about sleep. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3396.44s)]
*  You mentioned earlier encouraging people with ADHD [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3397.56s)]
*  or who think they might have ADHD [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3401.7599999999998s)]
*  to keep a somewhat regular eating schedule, [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3403.4s)]
*  or at least to make sure that they're eating. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3406.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3408.64s)]
*  And to not let their meals get fragmented [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3409.6s)]
*  into starting a meal, then finishing it later. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3411.52s)]
*  Like have, for some people it's breakfast, lunch, and dinner. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3413.2799999999997s)]
*  For some people, like myself, it's lunch, snack, dinner, [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3416.3199999999997s)]
*  whatever it is, keeping a regular schedule. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3419.42s)]
*  Exercise, aside from encouraging people [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3423.08s)]
*  to not exercise too late in the day, [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3427.24s)]
*  certainly not caffeine and exercise late in the day, [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3430.7999999999997s)]
*  are there any data about specific types of exercise [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3434.2s)]
*  being better for ADHD independent of effects on sleep? [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3437.04s)]
*  I realize they're hard to tease apart. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3442.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, there's a few studies [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3444.3199999999997s)]
*  looking at acute aerobic exercise. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3445.96s)]
*  Part of it is that it's hard to study people [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3449.52s)]
*  when they're exercising during many exercises. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3452.32s)]
*  I mean, you're not gonna wire someone up [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3454.8s)]
*  when they're swimming, for example. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3456.8s)]
*  So there's not a lot of studies in any one approach, [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3459.64s)]
*  and there's so much diversity [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3463.58s)]
*  that often it just gets lumped together. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3464.74s)]
*  So there do seem to be some acute effects [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3466.44s)]
*  of measurably improving some of the executive functions [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3468.84s)]
*  associated with better attention from acute exercise, [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3472.16s)]
*  and there seem to be some more general [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3475.48s)]
*  or longer term benefits from people [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3478.58s)]
*  who are consistently actively exercising, [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3481.1s)]
*  having, being able to concentrate longer, [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3484.8199999999997s)]
*  being able to switch attention more appropriately [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3487.86s)]
*  or effectively, and there's a huge body [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3491.8199999999997s)]
*  of sort of clinical literature of patients reporting. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3494.2999999999997s)]
*  I know I feel much more alert the day [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3498.06s)]
*  I get my workout in the gym, or I feel better, [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3499.7799999999997s)]
*  or the week I took off from that was a big mistake. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3502.14s)]
*  But I would say identifying at what's the most valuable [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3506.28s)]
*  or what's the best duration. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3510.5600000000004s)]
*  I ran through the data about a year or two ago, [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3513.36s)]
*  and I would say that we can't make any conclusions, [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3515.6400000000003s)]
*  and I would say at some level, [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3519.0400000000004s)]
*  try it and see what works for you, [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3521.2400000000002s)]
*  and that's what's important. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3523.1600000000003s)]
*  It isn't what works for everyone. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3526.1200000000003s)]
*  Is there a relationship between ADHD and addiction [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3528.32s)]
*  because of the impulsivity component? [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3532.98s)]
*  Yes, and, so the answer is, [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3535.4s)]
*  and these are really rough statistics. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3538.28s)]
*  I actually, one of my pet peeves is people who quote, [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3540.48s)]
*  oh, the rate of this is 27.43%. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3543.48s)]
*  Well, it might have been in that study, [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3546.96s)]
*  but that's looking at one population at one set of, [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3549.6s)]
*  so I use ballpark figures. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3552.6s)]
*  The ballpark figure is Americans in the last 20 years, [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3554.26s)]
*  more than that, about 20% of Americans [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3559.36s)]
*  run into some addiction, substance addiction problem, [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3562.14s)]
*  either alcohol or drugs. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3565.72s)]
*  People with ADHD have a rate that's almost doubled, [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3567.52s)]
*  and it's higher in men than in women. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3570.2599999999998s)]
*  Double. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3573.64s)]
*  Almost double, almost 40% risk. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3574.48s)]
*  And that's for substance abuse, [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3576.56s)]
*  not behavioral addictions. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3577.92s)]
*  Yeah, that's substance abuse, [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3580.2s)]
*  and that's looking at abuse, [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3581.8399999999997s)]
*  and we can get into the related topic of what's misuse [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3583.3599999999997s)]
*  and versus abuse, and I have pet peeves there. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3586.08s)]
*  However, kids who are put on stimulant medications [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3589.42s)]
*  when they're young, and I should say, [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3593.16s)]
*  the stimulants themselves do have a small potential [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3595.52s)]
*  for addiction, but putting kids on stimulants [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3598.8199999999997s)]
*  pretty much normalizes their rate of addiction problems. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3602.8199999999997s)]
*  So it protects them. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3607.0s)]
*  So it protects them. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3607.8399999999997s)]
*  It protects them. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3608.66s)]
*  This is a really important point [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3609.5s)]
*  that I think maybe we just hover on for a second, [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3610.6s)]
*  because I think many people, including myself, [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3613.3799999999997s)]
*  assume that, well, if you were putting these kids [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3616.16s)]
*  on amphetamines, of which many of the medications [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3618.72s)]
*  for ADHD are, that we're creating kids [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3622.28s)]
*  that are addicted to amphetamines [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3626.88s)]
*  or to a hyperstimulation period. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3629.4s)]
*  But you're telling me it's actually protective [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3632.5600000000004s)]
*  to put kids with real ADHD on medication for ADHD. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3635.32s)]
*  I can say not absolutely every study has found this, [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3639.6400000000003s)]
*  but several large meta-analyses have gone back, [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3642.6400000000003s)]
*  and most of them have found this fairly dramatic benefit [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3646.0400000000004s)]
*  to being on stimulants as a kid [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3651.16s)]
*  in terms of specifically reducing substance abuse risk. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3652.72s)]
*  And some of them that have looked at this, [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3656.68s)]
*  when I said it was a yes and, [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3658.4s)]
*  it seems to be that it's not just the impulsivity traits, [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3662.0s)]
*  but some of the inattentive ones too. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3664.52s)]
*  If your teacher's lecturing about the risks of alcohol [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3666.88s)]
*  or this and this, and you're zoning out at the window [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3669.92s)]
*  and looking at the plane flying by, [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3672.86s)]
*  you have less pertinent information on the topics. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3675.08s)]
*  You may be less attentive to the negative effects [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3677.92s)]
*  that other kids are seeing among the classmates [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3681.76s)]
*  who are stoners at this age, or X, Y, or Z. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3683.6800000000003s)]
*  So it seems that both inattentive sets of ADHD symptoms [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3686.8s)]
*  and the impulsive thrill seeking, [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3691.52s)]
*  not weighing the consequences as heavily, [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3696.04s)]
*  are all contributing to this heightened risk. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3699.34s)]
*  I have this model in my head that is [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3702.92s)]
*  perhaps completely wrong, maybe partially wrong. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3706.7200000000003s)]
*  And it goes something like this, [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3710.64s)]
*  that we know that the neural circuits [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3712.28s)]
*  involved in executive control and directing attention [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3716.2400000000002s)]
*  and maintaining attention and avoiding distraction, [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3719.46s)]
*  this kind of thing, [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3721.86s)]
*  use dopamine and epinephrine and norepinephrine, [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3723.8s)]
*  at least to some extent. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3728.52s)]
*  And we know that people with ADHD are capable of focus, [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3730.48s)]
*  as you said, it's a failure to direct that focus, [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3734.2s)]
*  maintain, et cetera. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3736.8s)]
*  So I've heard from you before this discussion [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3738.32s)]
*  that people that tend to drink lots and lots of caffeine [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3741.96s)]
*  or who can drop into an activity [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3746.0s)]
*  but have a lot of distractibility, [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3747.82s)]
*  that they might have ADHD. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3749.22s)]
*  So what I'm imagining here is that the threshold [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3752.88s)]
*  to get dopamine, epinephrine and norepinephrine released [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3755.0s)]
*  is either much higher or more complicated [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3758.6s)]
*  for people with ADHD. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3762.2s)]
*  And so what they're seeking is these catecholamines, [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3763.56s)]
*  these three chemicals, dopamine, epinephrine, [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3767.44s)]
*  norepinephrine, and that if they're given a medication [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3769.3199999999997s)]
*  that puts them in that range where they're getting it, [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3773.18s)]
*  then they're good, they can stop seeking it, so to speak. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3775.56s)]
*  And I'm raising this now [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3780.18s)]
*  because we're talking about addiction. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3781.64s)]
*  Addiction is a pursuit of things, essentially. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3782.88s)]
*  And I guess what I'm saying is it seems to me [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3786.64s)]
*  that the model of ADHD that we hear about [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3791.2999999999997s)]
*  is that people can't focus, [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3794.24s)]
*  their dopamine circuits are all out of whack, [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3797.44s)]
*  and then you put them on this dopaminergic drug [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3799.3399999999997s)]
*  and basically you get them addicted [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3801.3599999999997s)]
*  to that tunnel vision or something. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3803.7s)]
*  But I have this model in mind now [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3806.12s)]
*  that what we are all seeking is to have portions of our day [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3808.2s)]
*  where we are directing our focus [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3811.7s)]
*  towards meaningful things that are generative in our life, [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3813.26s)]
*  work, school, relationships, et cetera. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3817.26s)]
*  And whether or not it's pharmacology or exercise [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3819.5600000000004s)]
*  or what have you, that it's just about getting [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3822.82s)]
*  into this plane of consciousness. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3826.2200000000003s)]
*  And I say that in no woo or abstract terms. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3828.6600000000003s)]
*  Is that right? [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3831.7000000000003s)]
*  I mean, are we really talking about here [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3832.5400000000004s)]
*  is a failure to access enough of these neuromodulators [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3834.1000000000004s)]
*  and these medications which we're about to talk about [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3837.6200000000003s)]
*  are really about putting us in the realm [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3839.9s)]
*  where those neuromodulators are just more accessible? [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3841.5s)]
*  I'll just say I can go with that. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3844.9s)]
*  Okay, well, you're the expert. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3846.98s)]
*  I mean, I'm putting this together [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3848.34s)]
*  based on kind of what we're talking about it, [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3850.3s)]
*  like getting enough sleep to me is a way [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3851.78s)]
*  of being able to have enough arousal during the day. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3853.9s)]
*  Exercise or these medications, [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3857.82s)]
*  just different ways of being able to access arousal. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3860.46s)]
*  Like if you don't sleep, [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3863.1s)]
*  you can't access arousal during the day. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3863.94s)]
*  So, okay, well, I'm going to hold that model in mind [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3865.52s)]
*  and I'm going to keep testing it to try and destroy it [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3867.9s)]
*  as we go forward. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3870.38s)]
*  Let's talk about the medications since you raised those. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3873.46s)]
*  And the first one I ever heard about was Ritalin. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3878.62s)]
*  Let's start with Ritalin. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3882.6600000000003s)]
*  How often is Ritalin used nowadays [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3884.34s)]
*  and what is Ritalin doing neurochemically? [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3886.78s)]
*  And what are your thoughts on Ritalin [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3891.06s)]
*  as a useful drug for childhood and adult ADHD? [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3892.94s)]
*  And I'm happy to repeat those questions. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3896.5s)]
*  So Ritalin is, or generic methylphenidate, [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3898.46s)]
*  and there's dozens now of slow release versions [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3902.2200000000003s)]
*  and there's even a patch, a skin patch, [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3906.34s)]
*  instead of a neural version. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3908.66s)]
*  Our definition of what a stimulant is [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3910.86s)]
*  is really squishy and vague. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3913.06s)]
*  In its broadest sense, it's any drug [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3915.94s)]
*  that has an effect in the body, [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3918.5s)]
*  like the sympathetic nervous system, [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3920.54s)]
*  which is a norepinephrine-driven [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3922.36s)]
*  fight or flight arousal system. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3925.18s)]
*  So by the leucis criteria, caffeine's a stimulant, [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3927.28s)]
*  well, butane's a stimulant, [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3932.0s)]
*  even though we classify it as an antidepressant. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3933.2400000000002s)]
*  Some of the decongestants are stimulants. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3938.34s)]
*  But more often when we're talking ADHD medicines, [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3941.0400000000004s)]
*  we're using stimulant more specifically [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3943.5600000000004s)]
*  for amphetamine-based products like Adderall and Vivance. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3945.92s)]
*  And again, there's a host now of newer branded [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3949.32s)]
*  extended release forms and methylphenidate. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3951.6400000000003s)]
*  And we lump the two together, [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3954.72s)]
*  probably most ADHD experts agree with, [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3957.52s)]
*  and this is where I'm gonna be disagreeing [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3959.8799999999997s)]
*  with most of them. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3961.7999999999997s)]
*  I don't consider Ritalin a full stimulant. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3963.64s)]
*  So the neuropharmacologists differ a little bit, [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3966.3999999999996s)]
*  but amphetamine is a strong dopamine [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3969.8599999999997s)]
*  and norepinephrine reuptake blocker. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3973.4399999999996s)]
*  So it prevents what's already been released [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3975.8399999999997s)]
*  from being taken back up, so more is available longer. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3978.72s)]
*  But in addition to that, amphetamine [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3981.8399999999997s)]
*  is a pretty potent, let's just say vesicle manipulator. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3983.76s)]
*  So it's actually forcing a bigger release [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3987.6800000000003s)]
*  from the vesicles when they're synaptically released. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3990.32s)]
*  So it's not just that the signal lasts longer [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3993.5s)]
*  and is stronger because of that, it's a bigger signal. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3995.94s)]
*  Depending on what study you look at, [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3999.7000000000003s)]
*  most of the studies suggest that methylphenidate [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4002.1200000000003s)]
*  is actually a pretty weak vesicular manipulator, [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4005.44s)]
*  and some studies don't find any impact there at all. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4008.78s)]
*  Which means if methylphenidate is basically [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4012.06s)]
*  a norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor, [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4015.42s)]
*  that's what wellbutrin is, that's one of the components. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4019.2599999999998s)]
*  And so why I would further say, [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4024.42s)]
*  if you look at the efficacy data, [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4027.94s)]
*  how well do these work in resolving ADHD symptoms? [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4030.86s)]
*  All the meta-analyses lump adderall products, amphetamine, [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4035.22s)]
*  and methylphenidate products here, [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4040.58s)]
*  and say they're here because they work better, [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4043.2599999999998s)]
*  this is success in reducing ADHD symptoms. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4045.8799999999997s)]
*  And all of our stratera, atomoxetine, wellbutrin, [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4049.18s)]
*  I use Cymbaltolot, modafinil, guanfacine, [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4053.62s)]
*  all these other things are down here as less effective. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4057.54s)]
*  But if you actually look at any of the plots [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4060.74s)]
*  that I've looked at and separate out, [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4063.12s)]
*  methylphenidate is actually closer to the pack below. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4066.3599999999997s)]
*  It's that amphetamine products are head and shoulders [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4069.22s)]
*  above everything else. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4072.14s)]
*  Methylphenidate's usually at the top [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4073.8999999999996s)]
*  of the rest of the crowd, but if you're just looking [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4075.54s)]
*  at the data objectively, there's a clear decision point. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4078.06s)]
*  So in terms of efficacy, amphetamine products are stronger. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4082.8199999999997s)]
*  But in terms of some of the side effect [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4088.62s)]
*  that I worry most about, it's not at all common, [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4092.7s)]
*  but it's one of the horrible ones [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4095.3399999999997s)]
*  is amphetamine-induced psychosis. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4096.66s)]
*  Now that we're finally looking at that a little more closely, [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4100.06s)]
*  because for years ADHD experts have said, [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4103.22s)]
*  yeah, it's really rare, let's not look at it at all, [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4105.820000000001s)]
*  let's not pay attention, move along, don't look. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4107.740000000001s)]
*  With amphetamine-adderall products, [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4113.5s)]
*  and that's probably dose-dependent, [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4116.46s)]
*  but it's close to one out of 500 people. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4118.3s)]
*  And what's, I'm going off on a tangent here, [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4120.5s)]
*  but I'll keep following it, [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4123.02s)]
*  because it's an important tangent. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4123.860000000001s)]
*  It's only one out of 500 people. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4125.7s)]
*  That's uncommon, but this is a really bad condition, [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4127.62s)]
*  because so amphetamine-induced psychosis [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4130.78s)]
*  is a schizophrenic-like picture. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4133.34s)]
*  Usually someone is really paranoid, [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4135.86s)]
*  really worried that their friends are manipulating them [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4138.18s)]
*  or the police are spying on them. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4140.86s)]
*  I mean, if you drink too much alcohol, [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4142.88s)]
*  you can be bat shit crazy, [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4144.5s)]
*  that's a highly technical term there. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4146.78s)]
*  You can be out of touch with reality, [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4148.94s)]
*  you can be hallucinating, [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4151.22s)]
*  you can be saying all sorts of nasty things. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4152.46s)]
*  But if it's alcohol-induced, [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4155.96s)]
*  you fall asleep at the end of that night, [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4158.16s)]
*  you wake up the next morning, [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4160.12s)]
*  you may feel horrible at the hangover, [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4161.24s)]
*  you're not hallucinating, you're not psychotic anymore. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4163.22s)]
*  Hopefully you're regretting what you did, [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4166.24s)]
*  probably not remembering much of what you did. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4168.64s)]
*  People will let you know. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4170.48s)]
*  With amphetamine-induced psychosis, on the other hand, [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4172.44s)]
*  classically and characteristically, [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4177.72s)]
*  and what I've seen clinically, [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4179.48s)]
*  it continues for days, weeks, or months [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4181.28s)]
*  after stopping the medication, [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4184.84s)]
*  which means we've changed someone's brain [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4187.16s)]
*  and we don't have lots and lots of data [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4190.86s)]
*  and it's actually only come to us [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4193.5199999999995s)]
*  because people are concerned about marijuana [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4195.32s)]
*  causing a similar picture, [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4197.5599999999995s)]
*  so now we're studying this a little more. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4198.78s)]
*  But with amphetamine-induced psychosis, [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4201.88s)]
*  about, and these are again, [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4204.16s)]
*  rounding from different studies, [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4206.12s)]
*  about 20%, if you look 20 years out, [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4207.5199999999995s)]
*  about 20% of those people [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4210.2s)]
*  are in a permanent psychotic state still. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4211.599999999999s)]
*  So again, it's uncommon, but it's such a bad outcome [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4214.639999999999s)]
*  that we really should be alerting people to it [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4218.96s)]
*  and I've been, I saw a much higher risk of this for, [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4222.72s)]
*  I can get into it if we need a reasons in my population [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4227.12s)]
*  in San Francisco, but I've had people coming [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4229.84s)]
*  from all the most prominent ADHD clinics over the years [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4233.0s)]
*  who just moved to the area and when I'd say this, [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4236.599999999999s)]
*  this is my introduction to, [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4240.6s)]
*  I'm happy to continue on this, but are you aware, [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4241.76s)]
*  to a person they said, no one ever told me that. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4244.32s)]
*  Now maybe they have ADHD and weren't listening, [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4247.72s)]
*  but it's so uniformly consistent [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4250.2s)]
*  that they didn't hear or know that that was a side effect. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4252.32s)]
*  And one in 500 isn't a trivially small number. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4255.56s)]
*  No, it's not trivial. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4258.2s)]
*  And I mean, why I got alerted to it [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4259.6s)]
*  is my rate in San Francisco [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4262.4400000000005s)]
*  is actually higher than one out of 100. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4264.68s)]
*  So I'll go into, I think, a couple different reasons. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4267.64s)]
*  One is I worked with a lot of HIV positive men [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4271.52s)]
*  and we know HIV, particularly in the days before [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4277.400000000001s)]
*  we had effective antivirals, [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4280.04s)]
*  is a virus that goes to the brain [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4281.96s)]
*  and in fact there's a HIV-induced dementia. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4283.6s)]
*  So probably some of these people had brains [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4288.240000000001s)]
*  that were compromised because of that and were vulnerable. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4291.200000000001s)]
*  Two, a high incidence of methamphetamine. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4294.76s)]
*  So methamphetamine, street speed, [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4298.2s)]
*  is a chemically different molecule than amphetamine [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4300.76s)]
*  as an extra methyl group [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4303.56s)]
*  and an extra methyl group can mean a lot. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4304.96s)]
*  So it's a cousin, but methamphetamine we know [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4308.08s)]
*  has higher rates of psychosis, higher rates of addiction. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4310.360000000001s)]
*  This tends to be more rewarding. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4314.2s)]
*  But again, in that population, [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4316.12s)]
*  and many of them would hide that history from me, [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4318.2s)]
*  but I think that the very first person I had [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4320.360000000001s)]
*  with methamphetamine-induced psychosis, [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4323.32s)]
*  a guy in his 40s, HIV positive for years, [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4326.04s)]
*  this was back in the early, mid-90s, [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4329.28s)]
*  was able to finish school in his mid-40s, [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4333.48s)]
*  get a good paying job in two years on stimulants, [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4336.44s)]
*  and then had a full-blown psychotic episode [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4340.28s)]
*  where his dad had died of a heart attack 10 years earlier. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4343.96s)]
*  He was threatening his mom [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4347.92s)]
*  because he believed his mom had poisoned her. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4349.48s)]
*  He flew over to Rhode Island where she was living. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4351.44s)]
*  He was making threats from a payphone, [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4355.2s)]
*  and because Rhode Island's so small, [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4356.839999999999s)]
*  he was actually calling from out of state, [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4358.36s)]
*  so it was a federal crime. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4359.96s)]
*  He got thrown in federal prison for this. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4361.12s)]
*  And he stayed psychotic for months [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4364.16s)]
*  after he wasn't using anything. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4367.08s)]
*  But it later turned out he had had a psychotic episode [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4368.679999999999s)]
*  10 years earlier on street math, [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4373.5599999999995s)]
*  which he lied about when I did the evaluation. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4375.12s)]
*  So the other high-risk group I had was, [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4378.32s)]
*  I was known in San Francisco as someone [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4380.44s)]
*  who worked with adults with ADHD [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4383.16s)]
*  at the early stages of recognizing ADHD. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4384.879999999999s)]
*  So, and I was comfortable with the broader range [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4387.2s)]
*  of stimulant dosages, and many providers are. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4391.679999999999s)]
*  So I had people who had, [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4395.919999999999s)]
*  and they were all young white males, straight males, [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4397.799999999999s)]
*  who had history, and I don't know [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4401.48s)]
*  how many of those demographics are relevant, [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4404.799999999999s)]
*  who had histories of taking stimulants, [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4406.88s)]
*  having a psychotic episode, again, being really paranoid. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4411.04s)]
*  And again, the numbers aren't huge, [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4415.4400000000005s)]
*  but at least five people with this general profile. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4417.12s)]
*  But even though they were paranoid, [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4420.88s)]
*  even though they were severely impaired enough [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4423.2s)]
*  that each of them wound up [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4425.68s)]
*  in a psychiatric inpatient hospital, [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4427.16s)]
*  which is pretty hard to get into in this day and age, [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4429.280000000001s)]
*  or even 20 years ago, [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4432.16s)]
*  they all liked something about the experience enough [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4434.12s)]
*  that they all wanted to get back on, [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4436.76s)]
*  and all of them knew enough to lie about this past. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4438.8s)]
*  So they didn't tell me about, they presented, [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4442.68s)]
*  all of them also had ADHD. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4445.96s)]
*  They presented with ADHD, [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4448.2s)]
*  they'd say I'd been on stimulants before, [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4449.5199999999995s)]
*  and I'm not working with that doctor [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4451.48s)]
*  because my insurance changed, or they had moved to the area. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4454.04s)]
*  So they gave plausible histories, [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4457.5599999999995s)]
*  and most of those within a month or two of restarting it [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4461.16s)]
*  wound up back in the psychiatric hospital. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4465.68s)]
*  I had one guy, bright computer programmer, late 20s, [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4468.04s)]
*  calling me from inside the psychiatric hospital [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4473.92s)]
*  to try to get me to prescribe more Adderall to him. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4477.28s)]
*  And not only that, he had convinced [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4481.48s)]
*  his inpatient psychiatrist that this was a good idea, [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4483.96s)]
*  that this was important to treating his ADHD [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4488.68s)]
*  and helping him retain his job. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4492.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4492.84s)]
*  So these are, as you said, straight white males [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4493.68s)]
*  who have psychotic episodes on their ADHD meds [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4498.08s)]
*  and continue to seek those meds [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4502.44s)]
*  because they quote unquote like the experience. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4506.4s)]
*  It feels like a manic high, the dopaminergic, [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4509.6s)]
*  high dopaminergic state. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4512.24s)]
*  Yeah, and you put the word mania in there, manic, [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4514.4s)]
*  and lots of people define this as amphetamine-induced mania [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4519.2s)]
*  rather than psychosis. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4524.12s)]
*  I don't because one is uniformly, [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4525.76s)]
*  and maybe other people are seeing more, [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4530.28s)]
*  that these people were paranoid, they were worried, [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4531.72s)]
*  they were anxious, they were delusional, [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4534.5599999999995s)]
*  but they weren't overtly enjoying it. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4537.72s)]
*  They weren't having a great time. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4540.5599999999995s)]
*  They weren't saying, I'm gonna party with all you friends [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4542.04s)]
*  and I'm only worried about the people there. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4545.599999999999s)]
*  And yes, they were talking more loudly. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4548.92s)]
*  They were sleeping less, [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4550.84s)]
*  which could be characteristic of mania, [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4552.12s)]
*  but there was no positive affect that I or police reports [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4554.6s)]
*  or often families give you extensive history [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4558.88s)]
*  of everything that was going on [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4561.68s)]
*  that there was nothing euphoric they were describing [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4563.84s)]
*  about it. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4567.4400000000005s)]
*  I mean, I think the second piece is how much of they, [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4568.76s)]
*  it's unclear how much they actually remember or recall [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4573.28s)]
*  or either through psychological suppression of it [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4576.32s)]
*  or physiologic, they're in a different enough state [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4582.44s)]
*  that didn't register properly, it's not clear, [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4585.88s)]
*  but they tend not to recall the paranoia, [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4589.32s)]
*  and by paranoia, it's persecutory delusions. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4593.679999999999s)]
*  I have people who assaulted family members [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4596.28s)]
*  thinking that they were being spied on, manipulated [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4599.08s)]
*  when they were sort of the parents trying to take care [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4602.24s)]
*  of their kids. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4604.719999999999s)]
*  I'd like to take a quick break [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4606.719999999999s)]
*  and thank one of our sponsors, Element. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4607.88s)]
*  Element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4610.44s)]
*  and nothing you don't. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4613.24s)]
*  That means the electrolytes, sodium, magnesium, and potassium [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4614.639999999999s)]
*  in the correct ratios, but no sugar. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4617.92s)]
*  We should all know that proper hydration is critical [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4620.24s)]
*  for optimal brain and body function. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4622.32s)]
*  In fact, even a slight degree of dehydration [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4624.28s)]
*  can diminish your cognitive and physical performance [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4626.44s)]
*  to a considerable degree. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4628.84s)]
*  It's also important that you're not just hydrated, [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4630.24s)]
*  but that you get adequate amounts of electrolytes [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4632.16s)]
*  in the right ratios. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4634.24s)]
*  Drinking a packet of Element dissolved in water [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4635.52s)]
*  makes it very easy to ensure [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4637.88s)]
*  that you're getting adequate amounts of hydration [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4639.240000000001s)]
*  and electrolytes. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4641.320000000001s)]
*  To make sure that I'm getting proper amounts of both, [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4642.6s)]
*  I dissolve one packet of Element [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4644.88s)]
*  in about 16 to 32 ounces of water [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4646.4800000000005s)]
*  when I wake up in the morning, [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4648.46s)]
*  and I drink that basically first thing in the morning. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4649.76s)]
*  I'll also drink a packet of Element dissolved in water [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4652.4400000000005s)]
*  during any kind of physical exercise that I'm doing, [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4654.6s)]
*  especially on hot days when I'm sweating a lot [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4657.040000000001s)]
*  and losing water and electrolytes. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4659.120000000001s)]
*  There are a bunch of different [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4661.320000000001s)]
*  great tasting flavors of Element. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4662.200000000001s)]
*  I like the watermelon, I like the raspberry, [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4663.64s)]
*  I like the citrus, basically I like all of them. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4666.24s)]

*  Someone comes in and they have, let's say an adult, [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4689.96s)]
*  they have five of the 18 criteria. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4694.96s)]
*  They meet the criteria for ADHD. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4701.4s)]
*  Do you tend to, well, after telling them about sleep, [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4703.84s)]
*  food, exercise, and relaxation, after that's squared away, [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4707.88s)]
*  if the decision is to medicate, [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4713.04s)]
*  do you just, and assuming they're not [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4715.52s)]
*  on any other medications, [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4717.08s)]
*  which cluster in this, two sets of clusters [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4720.0s)]
*  that you described before, the amphetamine type, [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4723.7s)]
*  the Adderall, Vivance, et cetera, [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4725.9s)]
*  versus the, I realize you put Ritalin [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4729.38s)]
*  at the top of the bottom cloud, [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4731.86s)]
*  Wellbutrin, Ritalin, Modafinil, you mentioned Cymbalta. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4734.3s)]
*  Which cluster do you go to first? [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4740.82s)]
*  I mean, some of this is just individual style [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4744.62s)]
*  rather than intellectually thinking one is better or not, [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4747.24s)]
*  and my style is usually to listen as closely as I can [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4749.98s)]
*  to what the patient wants. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4754.259999999999s)]
*  That doesn't mean agree with them, [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4755.82s)]
*  but to explain in as much detail as I can [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4757.299999999999s)]
*  what I perceive the risks and the likelihood of those are [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4762.259999999999s)]
*  and what I perceive the benefits to be. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4765.58s)]
*  For years, just statistically, [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4768.74s)]
*  I had many more people who were on non-stimulants [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4770.7s)]
*  than stimulants compared to the general ADHD population, [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4773.78s)]
*  and that's even accounting for, by many variables, [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4777.74s)]
*  I've always worked with a lot of people [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4781.3s)]
*  who are on disability from Medicare. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4783.86s)]
*  I also worked with people who are on Medicaid [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4785.26s)]
*  and the city's insurance before Obamacare happened. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4787.9s)]
*  So I worked with, not entirely, [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4792.099999999999s)]
*  but a skewed, more dysfunctional, [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4795.38s)]
*  more severely afflicted population, [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4797.94s)]
*  which again you would think would be a better match [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4799.82s)]
*  for the more powerful drugs. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4802.86s)]
*  I'll jump back, but this actually is a situation [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4805.72s)]
*  where we have more powerful drugs. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4808.88s)]
*  So often when I treat people with depression, [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4811.04s)]
*  they'll try one or two or three antidepressants and say, [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4813.56s)]
*  well, give me something that's more powerful. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4816.400000000001s)]
*  And with depression, [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4818.8s)]
*  maybe we can put ketamine out of the picture, [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4820.76s)]
*  and I know this is a side issue, [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4822.6s)]
*  but all of our antidepressants seem to work equally well. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4824.360000000001s)]
*  We don't have potent antidepressants [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4828.04s)]
*  and the God FDA approved. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4830.4400000000005s)]
*  It works in a certain range of likelihood, [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4834.12s)]
*  but with the stimulants, [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4836.8s)]
*  the antipyretic-based products really are more powerful [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4838.48s)]
*  and more so than with depression [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4841.44s)]
*  or many of our other conditions [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4844.84s)]
*  where it's more a categorical, [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4846.2s)]
*  this will help or not as long as you're above a threshold, [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4848.64s)]
*  there's a more linear relationship. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4851.44s)]
*  If a little bit of well-beauten helps, [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4853.64s)]
*  a lot is likely to help more. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4856.6s)]
*  I mean, you might start getting more side effect issues [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4859.14s)]
*  and there may be good reasons to not keep going up, [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4861.58s)]
*  but there's a more linear dosage results relationship. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4865.26s)]
*  Do you worry about strain on the heart [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4869.14s)]
*  with amphetamine products, [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4872.82s)]
*  just even if it's relatively low dose over time, [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4875.86s)]
*  just the strain on the calcium channels and on the heart, [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4878.86s)]
*  is it true that stimulant-based medications for ADHD [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4885.62s)]
*  can, quote unquote, weaken the heart? [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4890.1s)]
*  When you used that term, [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4892.820000000001s)]
*  I was talking to Rob beforehand about running marathons [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4894.22s)]
*  and when I ran the 100th anniversary of the Boston Marathon, [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4897.22s)]
*  they had some of the medical literature [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4901.14s)]
*  from the previous decades [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4902.860000000001s)]
*  and one of the medical warnings was, [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4905.02s)]
*  maybe you could do one or two marathons in your life, [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4908.740000000001s)]
*  but don't do more than that [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4911.14s)]
*  because your heart will wear out. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4912.3s)]
*  And I've run 100 and my heart, I think, is still beating, [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4914.860000000001s)]
*  so we know things we thought we know at one point. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4918.46s)]
*  Common cardiovascular effects of not just the stimulants [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4922.54s)]
*  but the non-stimulants that are affecting norepinephrine, [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4925.82s)]
*  so Wilbutrin, Cymbalta, Modafinil, it's less clear [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4928.14s)]
*  and we can get into that when we talk about Modafinil [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4933.18s)]
*  but clearly methylphenidate amphetamine, [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4935.62s)]
*  on average increase, therapeutic doses increase, [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4938.58s)]
*  heart rate a few points, increase blood pressure a few points, [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4943.42s)]
*  but part of that obscures that probably 80% of people [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4948.34s)]
*  don't have any change and maybe 20% have maybe [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4951.42s)]
*  a more slightly significant change, [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4954.26s)]
*  so we know that there's some impact there. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4956.62s)]
*  We know there's some people with extremely rare [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4960.38s)]
*  genetic underlying conditions, [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4963.66s)]
*  usually related to the neurologic wiring of the heart [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4967.58s)]
*  who are particularly vulnerable to dropping dead [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4971.02s)]
*  from a stimulant, almost every year there's, [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4974.66s)]
*  a well-trained athlete, either professional player [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4977.82s)]
*  or more often a high school or college player, college, [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4980.82s)]
*  who will take cocaine, take Ritalin, [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4983.82s)]
*  take prescription stimulant and drop dead of a heart attack. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4986.62s)]
*  The risk of that's so uncommon, this is 15 years ago, [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4992.1s)]
*  when Adderall XR came out, the Canadian government [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4997.34s)]
*  was worried enough about this risk [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5000.1s)]
*  that they banned Adderall XR for almost a year [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5002.46s)]
*  and because they have a comprehensive medical system, [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5006.9s)]
*  they could look more extensively at the numbers [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5010.099999999999s)]
*  and this is looking at kids. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5012.42s)]
*  The percentage of kids who drop dead with Adderall [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5014.86s)]
*  was tiny and not just tiny, it was lower than the kids [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5020.5s)]
*  who aren't on Adderall who dropped out of a heart attack. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5025.66s)]
*  So part of it is if you're in this rare genetic condition, [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5028.299999999999s)]
*  almost always there's family members [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5032.7s)]
*  or you've had some other near-death or syncopal episode [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5035.06s)]
*  where you passed out, so history taking of the individual [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5040.02s)]
*  and family history and if you're at all worried or concerned, [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5043.54s)]
*  you can do EKGs which detect most of those [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5047.22s)]
*  electrical abnormalities but the cardiology [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5050.22s)]
*  and lots of my colleagues practice maybe a more conservative [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5053.580000000001s)]
*  cover your ass medicine approach where everyone has to have [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5058.9400000000005s)]
*  an EKG before they're on a stimulant [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5062.06s)]
*  even the cardiology associations have said [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5064.62s)]
*  that seems to be a waste of resources. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5067.9s)]
*  Absolutely do a thorough history, [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5070.1s)]
*  absolutely do a thorough family history [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5072.66s)]
*  if there's anything of concern [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5074.86s)]
*  or if the patient's anxious about it, get an EKG [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5076.74s)]
*  but other than that, these should be generally safe [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5080.1s)]
*  for most people's hearts. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5083.38s)]
*  So there was a meta analysis that came out earlier this year [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5085.04s)]
*  on so most of the studies looking at more serious [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5089.26s)]
*  other than just mild hypertension [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5093.42s)]
*  or mild elevation of heart rate haven't found much [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5095.1s)]
*  but most of them only look a year out or a year of treatment [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5099.46s)]
*  do we see rates of heart attacks, do we see rates of strokes, [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5102.58s)]
*  do we see rates of dangerous arrhythmias [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5105.9400000000005s)]
*  and in general, they're looking at a young population [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5109.9800000000005s)]
*  where these events are really uncommon anyway [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5113.1s)]
*  and most of them didn't find any evidence of problems [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5115.9s)]
*  in a year or two out, the more recent study [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5119.58s)]
*  looked as long as 14 years out [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5122.62s)]
*  and there they found measurable statistically significant [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5124.74s)]
*  increase in risk that increased during the first three years [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5128.78s)]
*  of being on a stimulant and increased at a much lower rate [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5132.62s)]
*  for the next 10 years sort of plateaued out [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5136.94s)]
*  but still measurably higher than people with ADHD [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5139.0599999999995s)]
*  who weren't on a stimulant [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5144.22s)]
*  but the absolute rate is still really, really low. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5145.3s)]
*  So for most people, it's not a risk. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5149.78s)]
*  On the other hand, if you start these medicines [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5153.26s)]
*  when you're 10 or 20 and maybe on them for 60 years, [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5155.9400000000005s)]
*  we don't know whether potentially more people [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5159.78s)]
*  are getting into more trouble. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5163.900000000001s)]
*  So if somebody presents as having ADHD as an adult [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5166.02s)]
*  and they've never touched stimulants [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5171.74s)]
*  and there would you start them on Ritalin, [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5173.18s)]
*  Wellbutrin or something in the Adderall Vibans cloud? [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5175.9400000000005s)]
*  Thanks for bringing me back to your question. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5180.02s)]
*  And I'm gonna jump it through in that sort of qualifying [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5184.22s)]
*  phrase never been on any stimulant in their life [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5187.42s)]
*  or tried it or something. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5190.02s)]
*  At least not consistently. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5191.38s)]
*  What I would say is these drugs are fairly common [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5192.9800000000005s)]
*  in our society, both illicitly and illicitly. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5196.5s)]
*  I mean, we know lots of kids, lots of adults with ADHD [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5201.3s)]
*  share their medication. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5204.5s)]
*  Lots of people have tried these things [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5206.14s)]
*  even if it's once or twice. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5208.9s)]
*  And that itself is valuable clinical data. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5211.0599999999995s)]
*  If they felt too revved up from it. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5213.74s)]
*  So if they have, I try to find out what dose was it? [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5216.179999999999s)]
*  What did it do for you? [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5218.66s)]
*  What good things did it do for you? [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5219.66s)]
*  What bad things did it do for you? [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5221.82s)]
*  So my presentation is usually, [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5224.219999999999s)]
*  Adderall is likely to be the most strongly effective [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5228.46s)]
*  or I more often are using Vibans. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5232.299999999999s)]
*  These are the other options, but Adderall also has again, [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5235.42s)]
*  rare but risk for these bad problems. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5239.74s)]
*  Does that scare you? [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5245.0599999999995s)]
*  Some people are petrified. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5246.219999999999s)]
*  They're not gonna go anywhere near that. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5247.9s)]
*  Some people say, yeah, I'm not that concerned about it. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5249.74s)]
*  And most people do come in with some friends at work, [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5253.78s)]
*  family members, X, Y, or Z. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5257.7s)]
*  They think they know what the drug is likely to have [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5260.0599999999995s)]
*  as an effect on them. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5263.299999999999s)]
*  And I tend to, at least as a starting point, [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5264.94s)]
*  listen to that. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5267.94s)]
*  And now, I mean, there are certain reasons [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5268.94s)]
*  I absolutely would not. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5274.0599999999995s)]
*  I mean, my worry, again, I saw more of it [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5275.54s)]
*  than I think most people on a higher rate [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5278.339999999999s)]
*  with amphetamine or psychosis. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5280.339999999999s)]
*  But a friend from college was just trying to refer [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5282.66s)]
*  a friend's son who's 27 and had a psychotic episode [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5287.0199999999995s)]
*  on marijuana and does have ADHD [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5291.58s)]
*  and is in bed depressed and not going to work [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5296.94s)]
*  and is being evaluated by two New York City doctors, [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5299.18s)]
*  but the psychiatrist kept him on Adderall. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5303.1s)]
*  I absolutely, again, the likelihood of recurrence [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5305.94s)]
*  seems so high that if you have a family history [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5311.22s)]
*  of schizophrenia or psychosis, [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5313.78s)]
*  or you've had any experience of it, [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5315.66s)]
*  I would not prescribe an amphetamine-based stimulant. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5319.22s)]
*  Could we go so far as to say, [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5324.54s)]
*  and I suspect the answer is no, [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5326.780000000001s)]
*  but because nowadays we're hearing more about the possibility, [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5328.1s)]
*  I want to highlight possibility, [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5332.46s)]
*  of high THC cannabis causing psychotic episodes. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5333.780000000001s)]
*  This is something I've stressed on this podcast, [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5337.38s)]
*  on social media. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5339.26s)]
*  I took a lot of heat for this from the traditional press. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5340.1s)]
*  And then, ironically, they're now putting out information [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5344.62s)]
*  that essentially speaks to the same. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5347.6s)]
*  I'm not saying this happens in everybody, [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5349.740000000001s)]
*  but there's certainly a possibility there. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5351.16s)]
*  Would you say that if somebody [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5355.32s)]
*  is a regular high THC cannabis user, [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5356.639999999999s)]
*  that they are at greater risk to developing psychosis [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5359.92s)]
*  if they're taking these stimulant-form ADHD meds? [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5364.48s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you could actually play that both ways. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5368.48s)]
*  I mean, you could claim that if they've already been [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5371.26s)]
*  on an agent without developing psychosis, [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5373.48s)]
*  then maybe they're more impervious to that [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5376.72s)]
*  as a potential side effect. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5379.74s)]
*  Or where you're coming more from is, [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5381.82s)]
*  if we're already on one agent [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5384.0199999999995s)]
*  that's pushing them that direction, [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5385.179999999999s)]
*  why the heck would you ever add another that could also? [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5386.58s)]
*  I mean, my approach clinically would be more, [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5390.099999999999s)]
*  what do you think the marijuana's doing for you, [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5393.0199999999995s)]
*  and might it be more helpful to just clear that [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5395.7s)]
*  out of the picture before we add anything new onto it, [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5398.8s)]
*  but depending on what they say or don't say. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5402.2s)]
*  So my reading of the data is very clear [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5405.36s)]
*  that there is some, I mean, even at low THC, [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5408.18s)]
*  there's some risk. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5411.9800000000005s)]
*  Is it a reefer madness that everyone who puffs a joint [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5413.54s)]
*  is freaking out? [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5416.740000000001s)]
*  Clearly not. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5418.34s)]
*  But again, it's much more potent than it was 10 years ago, [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5419.62s)]
*  that was 70 years ago, I guess. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5423.46s)]
*  Yeah, especially as I understand, [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5425.46s)]
*  we had an expert from the cannabis research community [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5426.740000000001s)]
*  on inedible form in particular, [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5429.320000000001s)]
*  it's harder for people to control the dosage. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5431.5s)]
*  Whereas when people use inhalation [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5434.1s)]
*  as a means to deliver, [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5437.38s)]
*  it seems like they kind of find the right plane [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5439.06s)]
*  without going overboard more often [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5441.06s)]
*  than with edibles in any case. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5442.74s)]
*  One other big factor is that CBD actually seems [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5444.82s)]
*  in some studies to have an anti-psychotic effect. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5447.78s)]
*  So maybe strains of marijuana 50 years ago [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5450.54s)]
*  that had a whatever nature thought was a more balanced view [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5454.38s)]
*  had less of a risk, [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5457.74s)]
*  but now that you can get pure THC products, [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5458.9800000000005s)]
*  and I'm sure you've highlighted that a big problem [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5462.58s)]
*  with this whole industry is even in Colorado, [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5464.98s)]
*  which three years ago was a state [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5467.86s)]
*  with the most close regulation and inspection [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5469.459999999999s)]
*  and almost a majority of what the labels say [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5472.179999999999s)]
*  don't correlate with what you're really getting. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5476.299999999999s)]
*  So this is not a well regulated industry, [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5478.339999999999s)]
*  even though states are trying to regulate their industries. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5483.08s)]
*  So you may not know what you're getting. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5486.9s)]
*  CBD again may have some protective effects [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5489.759999999999s)]
*  of getting pure and higher potency THC [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5492.7s)]
*  may be particularly undesirable. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5496.98s)]
*  So in my own YouTube podcast series, [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5499.94s)]
*  I've researched lots of subjects [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5503.94s)]
*  and most of them I wind up saying, [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5505.82s)]
*  we don't have a lot of data on it [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5508.139999999999s)]
*  and there's not a lot of data on marijuana. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5509.5s)]
*  It's the one subject I've actually changed my mind [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5512.179999999999s)]
*  from reading was out there. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5515.58s)]
*  And for years I would tell people, [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5517.5199999999995s)]
*  because being in San Francisco, [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5520.02s)]
*  even before the wave of legalization, [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5522.02s)]
*  lots of people were using it, [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5524.780000000001s)]
*  lots of people felt to help them. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5526.02s)]
*  And what I would tell them is the data we have, [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5528.780000000001s)]
*  and these are from everyday users, [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5530.820000000001s)]
*  is that they are measurable, [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5533.06s)]
*  you know, that the characteristic of the classic stoner [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5534.820000000001s)]
*  has a grain of truth to it. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5538.660000000001s)]
*  So measurably lower motivation, [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5540.580000000001s)]
*  poor organization of thought, lower energy [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5543.26s)]
*  are strongly correlated with daily marijuana use. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5546.52s)]
*  Why would anyone with ADHD want any of that going on? [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5550.400000000001s)]
*  That seems like a perfect misfit [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5553.84s)]
*  or accentuating what's not working right. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5556.360000000001s)]
*  Over the years though, [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5559.8s)]
*  I had a handful of people would swear [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5560.64s)]
*  it worked better for them than stimulants, [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5563.0s)]
*  it worked better than the non-stimulant alternatives. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5565.280000000001s)]
*  Clearly not everybody. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5569.360000000001s)]
*  And when I looked at the data, [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5571.740000000001s)]
*  there is actually some tiny studies, [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5573.12s)]
*  you know, there are some that are funded [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5577.04s)]
*  by marijuana organizations, [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5578.8s)]
*  so that doesn't mean they're wrong, [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5580.32s)]
*  but it's harder to evaluate how objective they were. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5583.04s)]
*  But there's some research that suggests [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5587.0199999999995s)]
*  there is some sub-segment, [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5588.76s)]
*  and I don't think it's eight people with ADHD in general, [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5590.5599999999995s)]
*  but some subset of that population [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5593.599999999999s)]
*  who may actually do better. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5595.48s)]
*  And most of the time they were looking at marijuana [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5597.48s)]
*  rather than pure THC, [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5600.0599999999995s)]
*  and what I was going to say is there's probably [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5601.84s)]
*  at least seven or 80 other psychoactive components [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5603.56s)]
*  to marijuana, not most of them is in a higher concentration [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5607.12s)]
*  as a THC or CBD, but they're out there, [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5611.52s)]
*  maybe they are more important even at lower concentrations. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5614.84s)]
*  I've heard this, that for some people, [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5618.6s)]
*  cannabis can help them focus, [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5621.08s)]
*  and I'm certainly not one of those, [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5622.900000000001s)]
*  but it certainly is interesting. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5625.68s)]
*  As long as we're on cannabis, [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5629.08s)]
*  excuse me, as long as we're discussing cannabis, [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5631.12s)]
*  neither of us are on cannabis to my knowledge, [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5633.08s)]
*  maybe I could just ping you for the relationship [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5637.0199999999995s)]
*  between various compounds that people use [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5642.2s)]
*  that are available over the counter [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5646.5s)]
*  or with online access to these compounds [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5648.84s)]
*  and ADHD symptoms specifically. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5653.28s)]
*  And then at some point I'd like to return [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5655.36s)]
*  to the amphetamine-based drugs. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5657.38s)]
*  So let's just start with nicotine. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5660.44s)]
*  So these days there's increased use of nicotine pouches, [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5663.839999999999s)]
*  gums, not just smoking, vaping, dipping and snuffing. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5667.96s)]
*  And it's certainly a stimulant, [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5672.719999999999s)]
*  and certainly a lot of people, in particular young males, [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5675.0199999999995s)]
*  are using it more often. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5677.679999999999s)]
*  The traditional media is now trying to create [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5680.24s)]
*  this kind of picture of nicotine being part [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5682.08s)]
*  of the kind of wellness and fitness community, [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5684.179999999999s)]
*  but in my observation, many, many more people [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5686.5199999999995s)]
*  outside of that category are using it. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5689.44s)]
*  So what in your experience happens when somebody with ADHD, [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5695.299999999999s)]
*  let's assume they're not medicating in any other way, [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5701.139999999999s)]
*  starts dabbling in nicotine use, [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5704.12s)]
*  and let's assume they're going to do this [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5705.919999999999s)]
*  in ways that do not cause cancer, [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5707.58s)]
*  because the smoking, dipping, vaping, snuffing part [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5709.639999999999s)]
*  is what causes the cancer. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5712.2s)]
*  Let's just talk about the compound nicotine. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5713.339999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so there's some well-done research showing nicotine [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5715.64s)]
*  is helpful for improving some of the executive functions, [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5719.52s)]
*  sustained attention, and I'm not sure [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5723.52s)]
*  which of the executive functions, [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5726.84s)]
*  but they help people focus, be sharper, do better. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5729.200000000001s)]
*  There was actually a major pharmaceutical company [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5732.76s)]
*  who was developing a nicotine receptor product [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5735.360000000001s)]
*  specifically for ADHD, [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5738.56s)]
*  and they abandoned that several years ago, [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5741.84s)]
*  and I haven't been able to find word [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5744.16s)]
*  as to why that was abandoned, [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5746.24s)]
*  whether it was some other side effect. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5747.88s)]
*  It's worth throwing out there that although nicotine [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5750.32s)]
*  in many ways acts like a stimulant, [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5753.92s)]
*  it actually is moderately unique, [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5755.639999999999s)]
*  and I hate people who say unique means one of a kind, [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5759.599999999999s)]
*  so I can't modify it in any way. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5761.92s)]
*  Unusual, maybe not the only one, [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5765.32s)]
*  unusual in that it both arouses people [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5768.16s)]
*  and reduces anxiety simultaneously. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5771.8s)]
*  Not too many, most of our stimulants are again, [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5774.52s)]
*  banging away at the sympathetic nervous system, [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5777.360000000001s)]
*  and that's banging away on good arousal and bad arousal. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5780.18s)]
*  So nicotine again seems to be both calming [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5785.08s)]
*  and helping alert or focus people, [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5787.8s)]
*  and as long as they're taking it [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5792.64s)]
*  in a way that's not clearly detrimental to health, [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5795.2s)]
*  which smoking and vaping and probably chewing are, [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5798.16s)]
*  well not probably, definitely are, [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5802.2s)]
*  and if it's affordable, [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5804.68s)]
*  because some of these products are pretty pricey, [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5806.5599999999995s)]
*  at least the chewing gums or the nicorette [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5809.44s)]
*  that was used for helping people with smoking cessation, [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5812.2s)]
*  I have some people who feel that it's been important [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5815.12s)]
*  and useful part of their regimen. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5818.48s)]
*  I have some people, small numbers, [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5821.12s)]
*  who prefer it to any other medications, [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5823.76s)]
*  and almost no, again, other than sort of the basic [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5826.04s)]
*  neurophysiology showing that it can have [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5831.04s)]
*  beneficial effects on executive functions, [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5833.4s)]
*  there's no research, at least as of a year or two ago, [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5835.48s)]
*  whenever I dipped my toe, [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5839.72s)]
*  not my anything else into the snuff, looked into it. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5842.28s)]
*  There's no clinical research showing [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5846.8s)]
*  does this help or not help. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5849.76s)]
*  What about caffeine and in particular energy drinks? [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5852.24s)]
*  These days, there's just seems to be an explosion [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5856.88s)]
*  of drinks that include caffeine, [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5859.8s)]
*  but also fairly high dosages of things like taurine, [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5862.2s)]
*  alpha-GPC, theanine, [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5865.84s)]
*  you know, so- [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5868.2s)]
*  Tyrosine. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5869.04s)]
*  Yeah, tyrosine, so, you know, [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5869.88s)]
*  things that are thought to generally amplify the production [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5871.36s)]
*  or release of neuromodulators like dopamine, [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5876.12s)]
*  acetylcholine, and so forth. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5878.92s)]
*  And so the epidemiologists say that [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5881.320000000001s)]
*  the most widely used psychoactive substance on this planet, [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5883.72s)]
*  and I thought it was alcohol for years, [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5887.76s)]
*  but it's actually caffeine, [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5889.360000000001s)]
*  because lots of groups outlaw alcohol [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5890.92s)]
*  who won't outlaw caffeine. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5895.4400000000005s)]
*  So lots and lots of people use it, [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5896.56s)]
*  and this is a gross oversimplification, [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5898.88s)]
*  but this is what I tell people. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5901.12s)]
*  Even though it's most widely used, [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5904.320000000001s)]
*  if you used it as an equivalent dose to our stimulants, [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5906.2s)]
*  I mean, essentially we're using it at a lower dose level. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5910.08s)]
*  It's a pretty lousy stimulant, [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5913.36s)]
*  I mean, separate from that it's working primarily [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5915.12s)]
*  on adenosine and indirectly working on dopamine, [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5917.32s)]
*  but associated with higher levels of angriity, [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5920.72s)]
*  higher levels of jitteriness, [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5923.84s)]
*  higher levels of cardiac toxicity, [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5925.28s)]
*  if you were to use it at a equivalent dose. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5927.5199999999995s)]
*  But most people are using it at a substantially lower dose, [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5930.36s)]
*  and the ADHD experts sort of historically [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5933.6s)]
*  have fallen into two different camps. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5937.400000000001s)]
*  Some of them have said, [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5939.04s)]
*  it's gonna interact with your stimulant [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5942.84s)]
*  or other medications, it's complicated, [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5945.84s)]
*  we don't want it messing up the picture, [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5948.76s)]
*  stay off of it, and the other half say, [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5950.8s)]
*  it's a stimulant, lots of people are using it [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5953.320000000001s)]
*  with these other stimulants, [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5955.8s)]
*  both full-blown stimulants and non-stimulant ADHD medications, [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5957.400000000001s)]
*  and as long as you know it's part of the picture [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5961.400000000001s)]
*  and you're trying to be constant with your dosage [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5963.32s)]
*  or aware of it, then fine, and maybe it helps you get away [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5965.719999999999s)]
*  with the lower dose of the prescription. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5969.88s)]
*  The one little piece I'd add in there [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5972.88s)]
*  is that often you don't know what dose you're getting. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5974.92s)]
*  So people have the common experience, [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5977.36s)]
*  as I was saying earlier, [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5979.679999999999s)]
*  I've only had three cups of coffee in my whole life, [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5981.0s)]
*  so this is all anecdotal or research, [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5982.92s)]
*  not personal experience data. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5985.639999999999s)]
*  But lots of people have the experience, [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5987.96s)]
*  go to their local Starbucks or something and say, [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5990.04s)]
*  whoa, that feels way stronger than usual, [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5992.72s)]
*  and then invariably they say, oh, that must just be me, [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5995.64s)]
*  I'm more anxious already, I'm jacked up, [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5999.16s)]
*  or, because they think Starbucks, [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6001.200000000001s)]
*  seven billion stores around the country, [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6004.0s)]
*  everything's automated and precise, they must be, [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6007.12s)]
*  Starbucks isn't, they control for the aromaticity, [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6010.12s)]
*  how many minutes each bean is cooked, [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6014.240000000001s)]
*  to its side it gets flipped over on, [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6016.88s)]
*  they're not controlling for caffeine intake, [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6019.08s)]
*  which is wild to you. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6021.16s)]
*  So University of Florida study, [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6023.4s)]
*  and this is several years ago now, [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6025.72s)]
*  went into a Florida Starbucks, [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6027.88s)]
*  bought the same drink every day for three weeks, [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6030.08s)]
*  and compared the caffeine content, [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6035.2s)]
*  the highest day compared to lowest days, [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6036.76s)]
*  was a three-fold difference. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6039.08s)]
*  Wow. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6040.639999999999s)]
*  And that's Starbucks, who knows what smaller, [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6041.48s)]
*  so one is you may think you know what you're giving, [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6044.92s)]
*  and maybe the bane of coffee drinkers, [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6049.84s)]
*  and maybe Senka in a teaspoon that you're dissolving, [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6052.8s)]
*  may be the most consistent there, [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6056.16s)]
*  but one of the risks with caffeine, [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6058.84s)]
*  and with pretty much any over-the-counter drug, [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6061.4400000000005s)]
*  is you may not know what dose you're getting. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6064.2s)]
*  Very interesting. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6066.56s)]
*  I mean, as I've said several times in this podcast, [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6067.52s)]
*  I think caffeine is a wonderful drug, [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6071.08s)]
*  mostly because I love the things that comes in, [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6073.16s)]
*  Yerba Mate being my preferred source of caffeine, [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6075.52s)]
*  but also coffee, and it certainly increases my focus. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6078.92s)]
*  It's a narrow plane though, [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6083.4s)]
*  two sips too many, and I can start feeling myself [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6085.28s)]
*  veer toward more lack of focus. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6087.92s)]
*  It doesn't seem to have a very pervasive effect, [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6090.4s)]
*  and dosing it on an empty stomach versus after eating, [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6095.8s)]
*  I mean, I'm not that precise about it, [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6100.64s)]
*  but I don't see it as a very reliable stimulant. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6102.36s)]
*  It's more to get to a plane of just normalcy for me, [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6107.799999999999s)]
*  given how much I've been drinking it [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6110.36s)]
*  since I was a teen really. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6111.759999999999s)]
*  I think most people are similar. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6113.5199999999995s)]
*  They drink it to feel normal. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6114.88s)]
*  Yeah, and there's lots of, [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6116.759999999999s)]
*  well, and there's also lots of cultural and habitual, [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6117.96s)]
*  if it gives you your warm fuzzies [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6123.04s)]
*  or puts you in the right mode, [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6124.799999999999s)]
*  or you think you're more alert, [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6125.96s)]
*  or you're listening to your favorite newscast in the morning [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6128.2s)]
*  as you're drinking it, that all is adding to its effect. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6132.32s)]
*  In terms of combining with other over-the-counter things, [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6136.56s)]
*  there is some study looking at caffeine [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6139.68s)]
*  and L-theanine together, and having some, [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6142.400000000001s)]
*  at least in a tiny handful of studies, [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6148.240000000001s)]
*  some measurable beneficial effect on, [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6150.320000000001s)]
*  I think it's mostly kids that have been looked at, [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6153.080000000001s)]
*  and nothing dangerous found [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6155.52s)]
*  across a pretty broad range of L-theanine dosages, [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6157.96s)]
*  but it's, I'm not aware of any good research done [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6161.240000000001s)]
*  with adding all the other things [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6166.12s)]
*  that are currently being added to it, [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6167.48s)]
*  and some logically may be doing something, [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6168.96s)]
*  some may be irrelevant, some may be more detrimental. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6171.88s)]
*  L-theanine certainly is being added [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6176.599999999999s)]
*  to a lot of caffeine-containing drinks [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6178.36s)]
*  because it seems to take the jitters of, [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6180.04s)]
*  and the assumption being that people can consume more [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6181.92s)]
*  of that drink as a consequence. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6184.84s)]
*  There's a tiny bit of evidence that suggests [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6187.72s)]
*  that it may both dampen, help with anxiety, [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6189.92s)]
*  but it may directly have some beneficial cognitive [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6194.48s)]
*  executive function benefits itself. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6197.919999999999s)]
*  Yeah, this is in keeping with the green tea hypothesis, [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6200.919999999999s)]
*  which I believe green tea is enriched for theanine. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6204.0s)]
*  You are somebody who quite refreshingly to me [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6209.12s)]
*  has talked not just about prescription drugs [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6212.0s)]
*  and behavioral tools for ADHD, [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6213.959999999999s)]
*  but also actually I think years ago, [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6215.5599999999995s)]
*  you were the first person to first share with me the data [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6219.16s)]
*  about fish oil and the EPA Omega-3s for depression. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6223.16s)]
*  Those studies were starting to come out, [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6231.5599999999995s)]
*  we were talking about those studies. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6232.639999999999s)]
*  And nowadays I think while there's still a little bit [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6235.44s)]
*  of controversy out there about fish oils, [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6237.8s)]
*  I think most everybody believes [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6239.599999999999s)]
*  that getting high quality Omega-3s from good clean sources, [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6241.4s)]
*  including fish oil is mostly beneficial or beneficial. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6245.92s)]
*  What about fish oil for ADHD in particular [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6251.32s)]
*  and what threshold dosages are relevant here? [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6257.2s)]
*  So just as with the fish oil for cardiac benefits, [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6261.28s)]
*  there was a time period where the first few large [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6266.4800000000005s)]
*  and they were pretty large, well done studies [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6268.92s)]
*  showed benefits for cardiovascular health. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6270.72s)]
*  The more recent studies with fish oil [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6273.68s)]
*  haven't shown an effect or benefit. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6275.52s)]
*  And strangely to me, and not very scientifically, [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6278.4s)]
*  the cardiology community sort of looks [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6282.719999999999s)]
*  at the more recent ones and say, okay, that's what it is. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6284.36s)]
*  Well, you have to reconcile all the data in the pool. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6286.5599999999995s)]
*  The ADHD fish oil story is a little the opposite [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6290.44s)]
*  and it's almost everything with ADHD. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6294.44s)]
*  It's been kids that have been most strongly looked at. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6297.719999999999s)]
*  The first few studies with fish oil and kids [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6301.12s)]
*  didn't show any benefits at all. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6303.679999999999s)]
*  And then subsequently there have been several studies [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6306.36s)]
*  that looked at benefits. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6309.32s)]
*  And again, and the field jumps to the second set [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6311.48s)]
*  without reconciling, well, how do we do a good meta analysis [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6313.839999999999s)]
*  with everything in there? [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6319.36s)]
*  And I haven't looked closely enough to know [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6321.16s)]
*  where their methodological differences, dosage differences, [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6324.2s)]
*  population differences that matter. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6327.04s)]
*  I'd say unless you're taking so big a dose [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6329.44s)]
*  that you're probably at risk for heavy metal poisoning, [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6331.36s)]
*  which is a possible issue with big, big, big doses [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6335.04s)]
*  of fish oil, I mean, most of the recommendations [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6339.88s)]
*  are in the range that it seems. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6345.56s)]
*  And I'd say that depression has been [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6347.28s)]
*  the most consistent field and that doesn't mean [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6348.8s)]
*  every study there has been positive either, [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6352.36s)]
*  but the most consistent field for a mental health benefit [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6354.16s)]
*  or a health benefit. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6357.88s)]
*  And there the recommendation is usually target [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6360.4s)]
*  about a thousand milligrams of EPA, [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6363.84s)]
*  of icosapentaenoic acid a day. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6366.360000000001s)]
*  If you're seeing some benefit, but it feels like [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6370.68s)]
*  that there's more room for improvement, [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6372.84s)]
*  so this is my motto I tell people, [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6374.96s)]
*  then you could probably double it reasonably. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6376.8s)]
*  I mean, some of the dramatic, there were dramatic studies [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6380.16s)]
*  looking at fish oil for mania, people hospitalized with it, [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6383.24s)]
*  but, and they use dosages as high as 7,000 milligrams a day. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6388.0s)]
*  To treat mania? [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6392.28s)]
*  Yeah, and that study, I think it was a Harvard area clinic [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6393.44s)]
*  that was doing it, the results were so dramatic [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6398.679999999999s)]
*  that they ethically had to stop the study [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6401.88s)]
*  before its intended completion, [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6404.16s)]
*  because the benefits seemed to be so robust [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6405.679999999999s)]
*  in the fish oil group compared to the, [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6408.719999999999s)]
*  that it was unethical to not put everyone on fish oil. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6411.44s)]
*  That's a lot of fish oil. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6414.48s)]
*  That's a lot of, yeah. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6415.5199999999995s)]
*  You probably need to get it in liquid form to make it, [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6416.4s)]
*  you know, so it wasn't so expensive, [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6419.84s)]
*  but I find this recency effect incredible that you meant, [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6422.12s)]
*  you know, which you mentioned a few moments ago that, [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6425.88s)]
*  and I think this is helpful for people to hear. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6429.16s)]
*  Certainly it is for me. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6430.84s)]
*  You know, we hear, you know, studies over the years [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6432.16s)]
*  of explored fish oil for cardiac benefits, [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6435.76s)]
*  and then more recently, as I understand, you know, [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6438.52s)]
*  these are not, have not been demonstrated, [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6441.76s)]
*  and there seems to be a focus on the recent studies [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6444.32s)]
*  as if the old ones don't exist. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6447.2s)]
*  That's essentially what you described [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6448.8s)]
*  for both cardiac and ADHD. [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6450.08s)]
*  I think it's really important. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6452.4800000000005s)]
*  We hear this with alcohol too. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6454.2s)]
*  I've been involved in this debate. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6455.6s)]
*  I, you know, I don't care if people drink one way [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6456.92s)]
*  or the other, provide they take care of themselves [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6459.28s)]
*  and others, and if you're an alcoholic adult, don't drink, [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6461.04s)]
*  and if you're a kid, don't drink, but you know, [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6463.320000000001s)]
*  people want to drink a few drinks a week. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6465.56s)]
*  I don't have a problem with it, [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6466.96s)]
*  but it's remarkable that every time a study comes out [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6468.52s)]
*  showing a mild benefit of moderate alcohol use, [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6470.76s)]
*  that seems to be the highlight, [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6474.4400000000005s)]
*  and then everything else is forgotten, [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6476.16s)]
*  and the inverse is also true. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6477.68s)]
*  One would think that the meta-analyses would include [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6480.16s)]
*  all, as many good studies as possible, [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6482.360000000001s)]
*  but I think it's important to understand [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6484.72s)]
*  that people hear that that's not always the case. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6486.400000000001s)]
*  Just because there's a meta-analysis doesn't mean [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6488.400000000001s)]
*  that it included all the relevant studies, [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6490.320000000001s)]
*  so I'm just restating, thank you. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6492.56s)]
*  I make it a point to try and get one to two grams [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6496.320000000001s)]
*  of EPA per day, just as a general mood. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6498.16s)]
*  You know, I'm not clinically depressed, [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6501.4800000000005s)]
*  but just to support my mood, to support focus, [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6503.280000000001s)]
*  to support well-being, including cardiac function. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6506.08s)]
*  So the other thing that I think is understudied [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6508.92s)]
*  with the fish oil issue is, and it's a Harvard guy [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6512.28s)]
*  who has a proprietary brand of purified EPA that pushes it. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6516.92s)]
*  So in nature, whether you're a whale or a human [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6521.76s)]
*  or a butterfly or maybe not insects, I'm not sure, [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6524.8s)]
*  across the mammal bird reptile kingdom, [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6529.28s)]
*  the omega-3s are found in about a two-to-one ratio [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6532.76s)]
*  of EPA to DHA, icosapenta-hontinoic acid [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6536.12s)]
*  to dicoxaxonoic acid, and what I tell people is, [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6539.76s)]
*  I think Mother Nature's probably smarter [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6543.76s)]
*  than any Harvard professor, and the brain particularly [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6545.4800000000005s)]
*  is high in brain membranes of DHA. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6549.32s)]
*  So I don't see, some people seek out EPA purified [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6552.84s)]
*  or sole, you know, only EPA brands. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6557.4s)]
*  That to me doesn't make a lot of sense. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6563.599999999999s)]
*  So I would say we can still count or do the numbering [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6565.5199999999995s)]
*  based on about a thousand milligrams of EPA, [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6569.0s)]
*  but don't worry that you're getting about 300, [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6571.32s)]
*  400 milligrams of DHA, and probably that's better for you. [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6574.16s)]
*  I'd like to take a quick break [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6578.799999999999s)]
*  and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Matina. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6579.96s)]
*  Matina makes loose leaf and ready to drink yerba mate. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6582.5199999999995s)]
*  Now I've often discussed yerba mate's benefits, [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6585.64s)]
*  such as regulating blood sugar, its high antioxidant content, [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6587.96s)]
*  the ways it can improve digestion, [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6591.52s)]
*  and its possible neuroprotective effects. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6593.280000000001s)]
*  It's for all those reasons that yerba mate [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6595.240000000001s)]
*  is my preferred source of caffeine. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6597.04s)]
*  I also drink yerba mate because I simply love the taste. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6599.12s)]
*  And while there are a lot of different choices out there [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6602.12s)]
*  of yerba mate drinks, my personal favorite [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6603.88s)]
*  far and away is Matina. [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6606.360000000001s)]
*  It's made of the highest quality ingredients, [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6608.08s)]
*  which gives it a really rich, but also a really clean taste. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6609.76s)]
*  So none of that tannic aftertaste. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6612.6s)]
*  In fact, given how absolutely amazing Matina tastes [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6614.44s)]
*  and their commitment to quality, [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6617.28s)]
*  I decided to become a part owner in the company last year. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6618.759999999999s)]
*  In particular, I love the taste of Matina's canned [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6621.48s)]
*  zero sugar cold brew yerba mate, [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6623.759999999999s)]
*  which I personally helped develop. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6626.08s)]
*  I drink at least three cans of those a day now. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6627.96s)]
*  I also love their loose leaf Matina, [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6630.4s)]
*  which I drink every morning from the gourd. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6632.16s)]
*  So I add hot water and sip on that thing [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6633.839999999999s)]
*  and I'll have some cold brews throughout the morning [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6635.759999999999s)]
*  and early afternoon. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6637.759999999999s)]
*  I find it gives me terrific energy all day long [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6638.919999999999s)]
*  and I'm able to fall asleep perfectly well at night. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6641.24s)]
*  No problems. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6643.68s)]

*  You're one of the first people that I ever heard discuss [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6664.76s)]
*  the gut microbiome and ADHD. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6668.280000000001s)]
*  This is me giving you credit [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6671.0199999999995s)]
*  for being way ahead of your time. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6674.099999999999s)]
*  I don't know how you are receiving praise, [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6675.46s)]
*  especially on camera and with microphones, [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6677.5s)]
*  but I just want to say that, [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6679.26s)]
*  it was over a decade ago that I heard from you [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6680.62s)]
*  about EPA and fish oil for depression and other things [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6684.099999999999s)]
*  about circadian rhythms, an area that I'm familiar with [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6689.0199999999995s)]
*  and just the critical importance of circadian health [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6691.98s)]
*  for everything that we're talking about today [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6696.0599999999995s)]
*  and more and on and on. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6697.54s)]
*  And so, again, thank you for raising these points, [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6699.62s)]
*  even if they turn out to be minor effects. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6703.7s)]
*  I think nowadays we hear about the gut microbiome. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6706.74s)]
*  I may have actually heard the words [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6710.7s)]
*  gut microbiome first from you. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6712.82s)]
*  Gosh, yeah, that would be well over, [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6717.86s)]
*  that would be almost 20 years ago. [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6722.0599999999995s)]
*  Remarkable. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6724.48s)]
*  So gut microbiome, [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6725.82s)]
*  what do we know about the gut microbiome [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6727.82s)]
*  and supporting it and ADHD? [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6729.62s)]
*  I'm going to kind of pass on that by just saying, [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6732.259999999999s)]
*  it's complicated and probably important [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6734.54s)]
*  and so many variables that it's hard to know [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6736.7s)]
*  what's really valuable [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6740.7s)]
*  in a day-to-day real human living perspective. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6744.219999999999s)]
*  Do you do anything to support your gut microbiome [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6748.139999999999s)]
*  just with your knowledge of the relationship [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6751.099999999999s)]
*  between gut and mental health? [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6756.3s)]
*  Does it impact your behavior at all in terms of choices? [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6758.06s)]
*  Yeah, only to the extent of trying to have a varied diet [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6762.5s)]
*  and eating at somewhat regular intervals, [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6765.900000000001s)]
*  but not more specifically. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6769.900000000001s)]
*  Great. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6772.38s)]
*  If that's where we're at, well, that's where we're at. [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6773.820000000001s)]
*  Before we go back to some drugs, [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6776.68s)]
*  I wanted to ask about behavioral tools for ADHD. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6780.34s)]
*  I've seen some of the literature claiming [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6785.82s)]
*  that certain video games might actually be useful [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6787.74s)]
*  for training focus. [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6790.98s)]
*  I've managed to find a few papers [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6793.339999999999s)]
*  that talk about focus and meditation tasks [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6795.58s)]
*  that kids in particular, [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6799.62s)]
*  but adults may be able to get better at. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6801.9s)]
*  I mean, are any of these brain training games [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6804.46s)]
*  to get people better at focusing, [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6806.9s)]
*  are any of them known to be worthwhile [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6808.46s)]
*  according to like real data or clinical observation? [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6810.599999999999s)]
*  So I'll start by stepping back a little bit [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6814.7s)]
*  and broadening it, I'll get to the video game things, [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6817.74s)]
*  but one of the effective approaches [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6821.42s)]
*  that helps with symptomatic reduction with ADHD [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6824.099999999999s)]
*  is cognitive behavioral therapy. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6827.139999999999s)]
*  So that's a form of talking therapy, [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6829.139999999999s)]
*  and my quick overview of it is that it focuses on [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6831.36s)]
*  actions, thoughts, and feelings, [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6836.66s)]
*  and that humans can have direct control [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6839.0199999999995s)]
*  of their actions and thoughts, [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6840.86s)]
*  not too much over their feelings, [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6842.02s)]
*  but all three are affecting each other, [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6843.360000000001s)]
*  and the traditional CBT was developed by Aaron Beck [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6845.46s)]
*  to treat depression probably 50 years ago, [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6850.5s)]
*  maybe longer, 60s, I think, late 60s. [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6855.540000000001s)]
*  Anyway, on the surface, it's a horrible match for ADHD [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6858.42s)]
*  because we know it requires lots of repetitive, [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6863.080000000001s)]
*  boring homework, doing the same thing, [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6866.1s)]
*  it involves introspection of being aware [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6868.22s)]
*  of what you're doing already, looking at those patterns, [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6871.5s)]
*  looking at what the triggers, [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6873.78s)]
*  to see if you can see triggers for them, [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6875.66s)]
*  and then doing lots and lots of repetitive homework, [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6878.18s)]
*  which, and when it's successful for depression [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6881.18s)]
*  or PTSD or other venues, we know it actually changes [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6885.1s)]
*  brain wiring and brain chemistry, [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6889.42s)]
*  so lots of people still think talking therapies [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6891.28s)]
*  are sort of up here doing something, [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6894.06s)]
*  and chemicals and medications are really changing the brain. [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6895.82s)]
*  If your thoughts are changing, if your behavior's changing, [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6900.16s)]
*  your brain has changed. [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6903.36s)]
*  That's the only place that thoughts and behaviors come from. [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6904.719999999999s)]
*  But there have been at least two groups, [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6907.799999999999s)]
*  Mary Cilantos in New York, and a Harvard group, [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6909.4s)]
*  by, I'm blanking on this for, [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6915.44s)]
*  Safran and some other, Ramsey at Pennsylvania, [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6917.04s)]
*  developed approaches using CBT techniques, [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6921.0s)]
*  specifically designed for people with ADHD, [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6924.12s)]
*  to help overcome some of those hurdles and barriers. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6927.72s)]
*  And both of them encourage, actually, [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6930.12s)]
*  the use of medications in combination with it, [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6933.240000000001s)]
*  because many people with ADHD are too unfocused, [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6936.360000000001s)]
*  too unable to sit down and do it, [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6939.52s)]
*  but these are approaches, [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6941.88s)]
*  and both approaches are amazingly similar, [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6944.280000000001s)]
*  although devised completely independently. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6946.400000000001s)]
*  At the core of both of those approaches [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6949.360000000001s)]
*  is having a system of scheduling each day. [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6951.320000000001s)]
*  That doesn't mean micromanaging each minute, [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6953.96s)]
*  but it's having the essentials in place, [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6956.52s)]
*  having blocks of time that you know what you're gonna do, [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6958.64s)]
*  and having a task list in combination with that, [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6963.84s)]
*  and ways of learning to prioritize [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6966.68s)]
*  and move things up or down. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6969.96s)]
*  And again, with ADHD being interest-driven, [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6971.64s)]
*  rather importance-driven, you may have a task, [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6975.360000000001s)]
*  I mean, you probably have 17 task lists. [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6977.360000000001s)]
*  One's near your coffee, one's at the grocery store, [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6979.200000000001s)]
*  one, you know, one, it's having one consolidated list, [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6982.040000000001s)]
*  because if it's everywhere, then it's nowhere, [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6985.36s)]
*  and two is the simplest triaging or organizing approach [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6988.839999999999s)]
*  is having the things that are both urgent and important. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6995.24s)]
*  So, if it happened today, those get in the A category. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7000.54s)]
*  The things that are important but aren't as urgent [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7005.04s)]
*  are the B category, and all the other things are the C. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7007.48s)]
*  And one of the temptations that people with ADHD have is, [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7011.24s)]
*  I need to be productive. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7014.92s)]
*  It's fun to go buy shoelaces, and that's on my list, [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7018.72s)]
*  so I'll go to buy shoelaces, [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7020.96s)]
*  because then I can cross something off my list, [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7022.400000000001s)]
*  but I didn't move the car, I didn't do my taxes, [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7024.26s)]
*  I haven't done my homework, [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7027.18s)]
*  and all the important things remain undone. [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7028.84s)]
*  So, it's a system for getting done [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7031.36s)]
*  what's really needed to be done, [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7033.78s)]
*  and eventually, if your shoes don't work, [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7035.2s)]
*  the shoelaces will move up to that A category, [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7039.26s)]
*  but for most people, they're not really there, [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7041.78s)]
*  and it's not a good use of your time to do them first. [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7044.08s)]
*  And there's much more to it, [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7048.5199999999995s)]
*  so the CBT approach can work with decreasing procrastination, [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7050.48s)]
*  it can help with structuring your own workspace, [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7055.0599999999995s)]
*  given that you probably have much more trouble doing that [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7058.24s)]
*  and not doing it spontaneously. [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7062.0s)]
*  It's how to eliminate distractions, [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7064.24s)]
*  and modules on even extending your concentration time. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7066.32s)]
*  So, the answer with the video games, [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7072.0s)]
*  there is one product that's actually been FDA approved [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7074.64s)]
*  for use in ADHD, and the really important thing [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7077.32s)]
*  to remember there is the FDA's system [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7080.76s)]
*  for addressing medications is much more rigorous, [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7083.8s)]
*  much more thorough, you have to demonstrate [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7088.8s)]
*  it really works and does something. [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7092.0s)]
*  When the FDA approves devices, [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7095.0s)]
*  basically, they're saying it's not gonna kill anyone, [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7097.400000000001s)]
*  it might help. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7100.24s)]
*  I mean, it might help tremendously, [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7102.08s)]
*  but having the FDA in premature for that [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7103.8s)]
*  doesn't guarantee that or mean that at all. [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7106.599999999999s)]
*  Do you recall if the study of that device, [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7108.9s)]
*  or the study that video game has a conflict of interest, [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7111.9s)]
*  was it run by the company? [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7114.36s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, so almost all of them [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7116.4s)]
*  have been run by the company. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7118.28s)]
*  I mean, it's good people at UCSF [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7119.48s)]
*  who are at least partly involved in it. [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7122.76s)]
*  Oh, is this Adam Gazzelli's group? [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7124.8s)]
*  I think so. [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7126.8s)]
*  Yeah, he's, I should just say [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7127.64s)]
*  that I've followed his work for some years. [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7128.84s)]
*  He's a neuroscientist, I know people [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7131.76s)]
*  who have been in his lab. [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7133.76s)]
*  He's known for doing very, very high quality [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7135.64s)]
*  and stringent work. [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7137.92s)]
*  Their product and some of the others [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7139.04s)]
*  can clearly show you get better at their product, [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7140.56s)]
*  and you get better at tests [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7144.0s)]
*  that look exactly like their product. [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7145.860000000001s)]
*  But in terms of real world, [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7148.64s)]
*  how much is this really helping ADHD symptoms [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7150.92s)]
*  on a day-to-day basis? [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7153.62s)]
*  Not a lot of data at all. [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7155.76s)]
*  So again, that doesn't mean it doesn't work. [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7158.28s)]
*  And I'm gonna go sideways in talking about neurofeedback [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7160.32s)]
*  because there's lots and lots of neurofeedback companies [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7163.72s)]
*  across the country that are making lots and lots of money. [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7167.08s)]
*  And there was an article [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7171.099999999999s)]
*  in the American Journal of Psychiatry in the last year, [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7173.96s)]
*  I'm not remembering which group did it. [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7176.48s)]
*  And it was another, [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7179.96s)]
*  a failure to find a significant impact from neurofeedback. [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7183.04s)]
*  And again, I'm not saying it doesn't have an effect, [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7187.92s)]
*  but I've had lots of people saying, [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7189.92s)]
*  writing me, should I keep spending hundreds of dollars [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7193.04s)]
*  each week as my insurance isn't covering this? [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7195.92s)]
*  And the doctor saying, oh, maybe 20 more episodes [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7198.2s)]
*  will retrain your brain. [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7202.8s)]
*  So this gets back to a topic you brought up earlier, [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7205.52s)]
*  how much are we retraining our brains [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7208.72s)]
*  with immersion in social media? [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7210.82s)]
*  And the evidence is we are rewiring our brains. [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7214.32s)]
*  So maybe anything pushing in an opposite direction, [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7217.12s)]
*  or maybe this is reinforcing some of the bad things [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7220.36s)]
*  we don't want. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7222.72s)]
*  We're in a messy world without clear answers yet. [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7225.62s)]
*  I've made it a point to put social media on an old phone. [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7230.36s)]
*  So those apps are only on that phone. [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7235.82s)]
*  I don't even know the number of that phone. [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7238.28s)]
*  If I need to post something, I airdrop it onto that phone. [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7239.8s)]
*  And this has helped tremendously in segregating [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7242.2s)]
*  that activity and limiting it. [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7244.84s)]
*  It also means that if people send me something [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7248.08s)]
*  which would otherwise direct me to social media, [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7250.7s)]
*  it's much more difficult for me to go look it up. [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7253.08s)]
*  It's helped tremendously. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7255.88s)]
*  I just pass it on because it's one of the things [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7256.76s)]
*  that's really allowed me to restrict my social media time [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7258.400000000001s)]
*  and yet still be in keeping with the fact [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7261.84s)]
*  that I think social media has its uses. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7264.52s)]
*  I post there, et cetera. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7266.360000000001s)]
*  Yes, so getting back to the scheduling, [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7268.76s)]
*  I mean, what I recommend to people, [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7270.64s)]
*  one of my weak, I don't know the specific apps, [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7273.24s)]
*  but there are apps that will help shut you out [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7275.4s)]
*  of Facebook or Discord or TikTok or whatever it is. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7277.44s)]
*  If you can't exert your own willpower, [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7281.44s)]
*  which again is harder to do if you have ADHD, [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7284.2s)]
*  and if the app approach doesn't work, [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7286.98s)]
*  the next level up is there are all sorts of companies [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7290.639999999999s)]
*  making lock boxes and physical devices [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7293.9s)]
*  where you can lock yourself out of your device [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7296.259999999999s)]
*  for certain hours of the day. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7299.0s)]
*  And I think that's a good idea for lots of people. [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7301.04s)]
*  I do too, and I think it also helps, [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7305.04s)]
*  at least in my experience too, [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7306.88s)]
*  do things that are very different than social media as well, [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7308.8s)]
*  but still consuming content. [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7312.8s)]
*  So I make it a point to read from an actual physical book [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7314.26s)]
*  a bit each day or night. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7317.76s)]
*  Also because I was raised doing that and writing by hand [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7320.24s)]
*  is just sort of in keeping with the way [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7322.76s)]
*  that my brain was wired. [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7324.04s)]
*  So maybe that's more specific to me and my generation, [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7326.8s)]
*  but I find that when I'm doing those other activities, [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7329.68s)]
*  when I go onto social media, [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7335.200000000001s)]
*  it feels more like a departure from the rest of life [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7336.64s)]
*  as opposed to the other way around. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7340.0s)]
*  But in any event- [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7342.84s)]
*  That's a good sign for preserving. [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7343.68s)]
*  I'd like to talk about some compounds [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7346.4400000000005s)]
*  that are not so typical, [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7349.200000000001s)]
*  meaning some people may have heard of these, [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7352.04s)]
*  but most people probably haven't, [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7354.18s)]
*  and they are somewhat novel to me. [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7355.820000000001s)]
*  The first one is guanfacine. [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7358.52s)]
*  What is guanfacine and why is it sometimes used for ADHD? [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7361.84s)]
*  So guanfacine and a related drug called clonidine, [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7366.72s)]
*  which can be confused with clonopin and others. [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7372.6s)]
*  So clonidine and guanfacine are both alpha-2 agonists, [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7374.68s)]
*  so they work on a subset of the norepinephrine system. [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7378.360000000001s)]
*  They're both originally antihypertensive [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7382.04s)]
*  for lowering blood pressure, [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7384.360000000001s)]
*  and it was actually studies first in clonidine [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7386.88s)]
*  that suggested this could be helpful [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7389.56s)]
*  with people with ADHD, [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7391.400000000001s)]
*  and I think it was just a serendipitous initial discovery. [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7393.04s)]
*  It wasn't seeking out its mode of action [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7396.64s)]
*  to see if that really worked. [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7399.32s)]
*  One difference between the two of them is clonidine [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7401.2s)]
*  jumps off the norepinephrine alpha-2 receptor really quickly, [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7403.8s)]
*  and for people who skip a dose [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7408.64s)]
*  with their blood pressure medication or stop abruptly, [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7411.4800000000005s)]
*  it's not uncommon to have rebound hypertension, [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7415.5s)]
*  and not just mild, but way higher [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7419.78s)]
*  than what you're being originally treated for [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7421.68s)]
*  to dangerous levels. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7423.98s)]
*  Guanfacine leaves the receptors more slowly, [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7425.86s)]
*  and there have been formal studies trying to see [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7429.1s)]
*  if this is a problem or issue there, [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7431.4s)]
*  and particularly given that people with ADHD [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7433.34s)]
*  forget their medication or run out and don't fill it in time [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7435.3s)]
*  or just don't remember to take it, [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7438.1s)]
*  the rebound hypertension does not seem to be nearly [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7441.44s)]
*  as common with guanfacine, [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7444.78s)]
*  and that's part of why the research has moved more [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7446.84s)]
*  towards the guanfacine. [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7450.0199999999995s)]
*  So there's extensive work by, [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7453.599999999999s)]
*  I'm gonna blank on her, Amy Arden, [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7456.58s)]
*  she's at Yale. [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7460.3s)]
*  Oh, Arnsten. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7461.4s)]
*  Arnsten, thank you, yeah. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7462.74s)]
*  And her lab and related labs have shown [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7464.0599999999995s)]
*  that guanfacine's effects seem to deal [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7467.04s)]
*  with strengthening synaptic connections [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7469.84s)]
*  in prefrontal circuitry. [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7472.5s)]
*  So unlike most of our drugs that are just boosting [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7474.82s)]
*  norepinephrine and or dopamine and work quickly, [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7478.38s)]
*  and I'll throw in this, [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7482.1s)]
*  because we didn't really touch this, [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7483.36s)]
*  most of the ADHD experts still say stimulants, [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7485.7s)]
*  amphetamine, ritalin, work quickly immediately [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7489.86s)]
*  because they boost dopamine right away, [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7493.34s)]
*  and our drugs like Stroterra, [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7495.54s)]
*  which is adho-moxetine or Cymbalta or Welbutrin, [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7497.42s)]
*  work slowly for ADHD because they're antidepressants [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7500.38s)]
*  and antidepressants work slowly. [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7503.38s)]
*  There's still people saying this, [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7505.5s)]
*  and for 25 years I've been saying, [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7507.78s)]
*  this is just wrong from one basic neuroscience point of view [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7511.0s)]
*  and wrong from don't you ever talk or listen to patients. [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7515.82s)]
*  So neuroscience view, how quickly does dopamine [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7518.46s)]
*  get reuptake blocked by Welbutrin [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7523.02s)]
*  or by adho-moxetine, Stroterra, or by Cymbalta [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7525.02s)]
*  within minutes to hours of taking it. [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7528.86s)]
*  So you would expect if you're boosting norepinephrine [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7530.5s)]
*  or dopamine availability right away, [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7533.7s)]
*  you should see effects right away. [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7535.299999999999s)]
*  And if you ask patients who these drugs work for [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7536.759999999999s)]
*  and they don't work for anybody, [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7539.66s)]
*  all the ones I've worked with say, [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7542.219999999999s)]
*  they won't work just like this thing. [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7545.0599999999995s)]
*  I could tell I took it and I walked out of your office, [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7546.299999999999s)]
*  and one guy I have who loves Cymbalta [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7548.78s)]
*  said I took it in your office [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7554.139999999999s)]
*  and I wasn't sure it was working [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7555.46s)]
*  and I got downtown to work 15, 20, [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7556.6s)]
*  maybe a half hour later, [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7559.4400000000005s)]
*  and there was this guy coming at me [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7561.160000000001s)]
*  with a skateboard on the sidewalk. [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7563.160000000001s)]
*  And I know in my normal ADD state, [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7565.04s)]
*  I would have just been flooded [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7567.400000000001s)]
*  and not be able to process, [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7568.56s)]
*  and I could just step out of the way. [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7570.660000000001s)]
*  So it worked that quickly and dramatically. [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7573.84s)]
*  So that's the aside. [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7578.4800000000005s)]
*  So jumping back, guanfacine seems to work slowly. [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7580.22s)]
*  So the synaptic strengthening building [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7582.900000000001s)]
*  and it seems to be the alpha two receptors [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7586.4800000000005s)]
*  that are on neurons that receive glutamate [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7590.96s)]
*  as a primary input. [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7595.6s)]
*  The alpha two receptor is modulating [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7597.54s)]
*  how glutamate is actually working [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7600.8s)]
*  and it's actually an NMDA glutamate receptors, [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7602.6s)]
*  not the more common in the brain, [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7605.92s)]
*  AMPA glutamate receptors. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7607.8s)]
*  No, that's an important point. [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7610.280000000001s)]
*  I'll just quickly throw in, if I may, [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7611.38s)]
*  that the NMDA, the N-methyl-D-A-spartate glutamate receptors [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7613.32s)]
*  are the ones that typically are associated [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7617.599999999999s)]
*  with synaptic plasticity, [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7620.0s)]
*  although the AMPA receptors can do that too, [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7623.12s)]
*  but what Dr. Cruz is referring to is the fact [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7626.639999999999s)]
*  that guanfacine indirectly modulates those pathways. [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7629.04s)]
*  So the longer duration to get the effect, [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7633.28s)]
*  it sounds like could be at least partially explained [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7637.5199999999995s)]
*  by a real change in neural wiring, [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7639.68s)]
*  as opposed to with, you use Cymbalta and Wilbutrin [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7643.88s)]
*  as examples of fast changes in neurotransmitters, [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7647.76s)]
*  neuromodulators that led to this very quick effect [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7651.320000000001s)]
*  in this patient that left your office, [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7654.360000000001s)]
*  got downtown and was already experiencing effect. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7655.92s)]
*  Put differently, sounds like guanfacine and clonidine, [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7658.400000000001s)]
*  not to be confused with clonopin, [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7662.9800000000005s)]
*  clonidine could help ADHD, [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7664.84s)]
*  but might take longer for the effects to manifest [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7667.64s)]
*  than the other drugs that we typically hear about. [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7670.04s)]
*  Yeah, so most often it takes two, three, four weeks, [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7672.360000000001s)]
*  and because of it, I mean, with the stimulants, [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7675.88s)]
*  you see effects right away, it's reinforcing it, [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7678.08s)]
*  and stimulants often, in addition to having effects [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7680.72s)]
*  on concentration, attention, other, [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7684.400000000001s)]
*  do boost energy for most people, [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7687.26s)]
*  do boost mood for most people. [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7689.04s)]
*  And can improve sleep, [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7691.08s)]
*  if they're not taken too close to sleep, yeah. [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7692.360000000001s)]
*  Guanfacine's most common side effect tends to be sedating. [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7694.360000000001s)]
*  Most people take it at nighttime, [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7697.8s)]
*  which is like, why are you taking a sedating nighttime [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7699.639999999999s)]
*  medication for your ADHD? [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7702.5199999999995s)]
*  It's because it helps, it works slowly indirectly. [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7704.0s)]
*  So Intune, the brand name, [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7707.5s)]
*  Extended Release Guanfacine, was approved in kids, [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7710.4s)]
*  because again, most of the research on ADHD [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7713.4s)]
*  is still in kids. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7715.76s)]
*  For treating ADHD as a solo agent, [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7718.48s)]
*  it clearly works in adults as well, [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7722.679999999999s)]
*  and even before Intune was approved, [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7725.88s)]
*  there were a handful of studies [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7728.2s)]
*  with either Immediate Release Guanfacine [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7729.68s)]
*  or Extended Release Guanfacine. [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7732.2s)]
*  In the studies so far, the results aren't distinguishable, [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7735.0s)]
*  they both seem to work. [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7739.74s)]
*  So clinically, because it's much cheaper, [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7741.18s)]
*  I actually use Immediately Release form, [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7743.66s)]
*  and all at bedtime, [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7747.76s)]
*  and again, because it's my impression, [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7751.0s)]
*  and I probably don't have an N [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7753.8s)]
*  that's big enough to do a rigorous study, [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7756.0s)]
*  is the sedating effects are relegated to the nighttime, [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7758.52s)]
*  and people are feeling okay during the daytime. [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7762.52s)]
*  I mean, some of the rationale with Extended Release [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7764.84s)]
*  is you're sort of smearing it over a longer time, [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7767.62s)]
*  so it should be less sedating, [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7770.46s)]
*  but depending on the time curve and how it works, [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7773.84s)]
*  you could actually wind up with being more [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7776.04s)]
*  uniformly sedated day and night with Extended Release. [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7777.88s)]
*  So I've seen good results in some people, [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7781.16s)]
*  I've had many who either didn't work [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7784.76s)]
*  or they didn't perceive a result, [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7787.12s)]
*  because again, some part for some people [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7788.68s)]
*  of the stimulant benefit is I can feel it, [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7790.84s)]
*  I know it's working. [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7794.4400000000005s)]
*  So the majority, at least in terms of prescription searches [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7795.8s)]
*  and what clinics tend to be, [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7801.4800000000005s)]
*  it looks like most people who are on Guanfacine [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7803.360000000001s)]
*  are on it in combination with either a stimulant [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7806.46s)]
*  or a norepinephrine or dopamine promoting agent. [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7809.2s)]
*  Let's talk about modafinil and our modafinil by extension. [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7813.38s)]
*  We hear about modafinil a lot in communities [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7819.92s)]
*  like the tech community and communities [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7822.9s)]
*  where people are trying to quote unquote [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7825.7s)]
*  cognitively enhance. [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7827.5s)]
*  What is modafinil? [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7829.94s)]
*  What does it do? [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7830.9s)]
*  What doesn't it do? [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7832.38s)]
*  How might it be useful for ADHD? [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7833.26s)]
*  So we're going to jump back to your issue [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7836.66s)]
*  with the recency in science and how to incorporate things. [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7838.9s)]
*  When some modafinil was a drug developed by a French company [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7841.86s)]
*  and approved there and used for decades, [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7845.58s)]
*  for maybe a decade before it came to the US, [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7848.46s)]
*  25, maybe 35 years ago. [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7851.58s)]
*  And at the time, all the research showed [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7855.38s)]
*  that it was an orexin receptor antagonist. [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7857.54s)]
*  Antagonist, agonist, works on the orexin system. [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7863.5s)]
*  The hypercrete orexin system, right. [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7866.74s)]
*  So boosting activity, but not working [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7868.66s)]
*  like all of our stimulant alerting drugs, which [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7872.62s)]
*  are working on primarily norepinephrine systems. [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7874.78s)]
*  So it was called the non-stimulant stimulant. [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7877.74s)]
*  Now most of the pharmacology literature [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7881.9s)]
*  refers to it as a dopamine acting drug. [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7885.7s)]
*  And some people are debating whether it's orexin [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7887.7s)]
*  that it's working via or dopamine. [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7890.46s)]
*  I haven't seen anything that to me means, [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7892.86s)]
*  gives a clear consensus. [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7897.38s)]
*  So I stick with the orexin because that's [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7899.78s)]
*  where I was taught. [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7903.18s)]
*  So orexin, getting back to the sleep, wake, [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7904.26s)]
*  and the brain and arousal. [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7907.14s)]
*  As I described, there's two ways to wake up in the morning. [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7909.18s)]
*  One way is the normal way that you just wake up. [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7912.14s)]
*  And the other is being alarmed by an alarm clock, [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7915.18s)]
*  your neighbor starting their lawnmower, someone snoring, [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7919.58s)]
*  earthquake if you're in LA or Hawaii, [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7924.78s)]
*  being startled out of sleep. [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7927.54s)]
*  That wakefulness system is a sympathetic nervous system. [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7929.74s)]
*  The orexin system is a more natural, normal waking system. [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7933.219999999999s)]
*  And it isn't arousing you. [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7937.78s)]
*  It's waking you, but it's not agitating you. [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7940.46s)]
*  Again, the claims originally was that this [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7943.42s)]
*  is how modafinil worked. [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7945.46s)]
*  It was waking you up, but not overstimulating over revenue. [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7947.0599999999995s)]
*  So other than being developed by this French company, [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7952.54s)]
*  the entity that spent most research funds looking [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7956.62s)]
*  into what this does or doesn't do was the US military. [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7959.7s)]
*  Because they have a big investment [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7963.54s)]
*  in wanting people to be alert and ready to kill 24-7, [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7965.02s)]
*  but not being hyperactive, trigger-happy, jittery [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7969.86s)]
*  like stimulants can do. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7973.06s)]
*  And particularly in the early days, [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7974.9800000000005s)]
*  this is really dating me of the Afghan War. [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7977.5s)]
*  We dropped bombs on Canadian troops [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7980.26s)]
*  by accident in our friendly fire scenario things. [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7982.38s)]
*  And the investigation, the pilot and the crew [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7986.42s)]
*  there blamed their trigger happiness on being revved up [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7990.7s)]
*  by methylphenidate. [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7994.66s)]
*  So for years, the military has relied [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7996.62s)]
*  on traditional stimulants to keep people [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7998.74s)]
*  able to fight around the clock. [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8001.820000000001s)]
*  And they wanted an agent that would give you [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8004.22s)]
*  alert, awake, but not revved up, not agitated. [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8006.74s)]
*  And I'd say there's some good evidence [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8011.42s)]
*  that that's really sort of how modafinil works or performs. [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8014.7s)]
*  So modafinil was called provigil for provigilance. [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8019.5s)]
*  And then when they were losing their US patent, [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8023.179999999999s)]
*  like many drugs, the provigil is a racemic mixture [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8027.54s)]
*  of left-handed and right-handed versions [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8030.34s)]
*  of the same modafinil molecule. [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8032.38s)]
*  They found that the armadafinil, the right-handed version, [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8034.74s)]
*  was the one that's doing most of the good stuff [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8038.0599999999995s)]
*  and has a longer half-life than the combined version. [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8040.98s)]
*  So they got a new patent for armadafinil, which is new vigil. [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8044.099999999999s)]
*  So that's the only difference between the two. [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8049.62s)]
*  They're the same active ingredients, [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8052.0199999999995s)]
*  as far as we can tell. [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8053.74s)]
*  And when it got approval in the US, [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8057.46s)]
*  it was approved for narcolepsy, where [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8059.5s)]
*  people are falling abruptly asleep during the day. [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8061.179999999999s)]
*  So it keeps them alert and awake there. [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8063.58s)]
*  It also got approval for circadian sleep shift work [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8066.0199999999995s)]
*  disorder, where because you're on a shift schedule, [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8071.22s)]
*  you're sleeping weirdly. [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8073.7s)]
*  And it got approval for daytime sleepiness from sleep apnea. [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8075.5s)]
*  But even at that time when it was approved, [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8079.94s)]
*  there were dozens of studies that showed, [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8082.26s)]
*  regardless of why you're sleepy, whether it [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8084.86s)]
*  was sedating medication, whether you had lupus or MS, [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8086.7s)]
*  whether you had some other condition, [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8090.78s)]
*  it works pretty well for keeping people alert and awake. [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8094.0599999999995s)]
*  So more than keeping alert and awake, [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8097.54s)]
*  there does seem to be evidence that it [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8099.58s)]
*  helps with some of the executive functions of attention, [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8101.86s)]
*  concentration. [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8105.099999999999s)]
*  My clinical experience with it, it [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8106.7s)]
*  tends to be, again, with the amphetamine on top, [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8109.219999999999s)]
*  many fewer people describe it as being helpful or as helpful. [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8113.9s)]
*  On the other hand, there's one study, [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8120.1s)]
*  and I'm forgetting the principal investigators. [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8121.660000000001s)]
*  It was Brown University, where they [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8123.580000000001s)]
*  used some very clever, sophisticated approach [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8126.06s)]
*  to try to sort out motivation versus pure cognitive [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8129.9800000000005s)]
*  functioning. [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8135.06s)]
*  And their claim, and it was a very well done study, [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8135.740000000001s)]
*  they were comparing it directly to an amphetamine product. [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8139.18s)]
*  Their claim was that modafinil was [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8141.9400000000005s)]
*  the one that was actually boosting cognitive functions [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8144.34s)]
*  and not just boosting motivation, [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8147.94s)]
*  whereas that most of amphetamines [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8150.5s)]
*  benefit for ADHD. [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8153.099999999999s)]
*  When we say it helps me concentrate, [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8154.299999999999s)]
*  it helps me sustain focus, it makes me less distracted, [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8156.219999999999s)]
*  their feeling, their analysis was [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8161.299999999999s)]
*  that the stimulant was mostly working on motivation. [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8163.339999999999s)]
*  It's a controlled substance, but not nearly, not [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8167.46s)]
*  the same schedule as amphetamine and Ritalin. [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8169.66s)]
*  So it's easier for some prescribers to prescribe. [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8173.86s)]
*  Even though it's the non-stimulant stimulant, [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8178.339999999999s)]
*  and I'd say most people do experience, [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8180.78s)]
*  I feel more alert or awake or better, [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8183.82s)]
*  but I don't feel revved up, about 10% to 15% of people [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8186.179999999999s)]
*  that I've worked with, and others have written about it, [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8190.54s)]
*  so I don't think it's unique, will feel revved up [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8192.779999999999s)]
*  when they take it the first few times. [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8195.86s)]
*  And invariably, the people I've worked with [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8197.94s)]
*  have said, this feels like bad speed, [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8200.7s)]
*  including people who haven't too, who never even took speed. [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8204.02s)]
*  So I don't know why they came up, [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8207.94s)]
*  I mean, it's just weird that people come up [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8209.58s)]
*  with the same terms. [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8211.58s)]
*  But it's, I mean, my interpretation is that [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8213.060000000001s)]
*  for some people, this novel substance primarily [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8215.460000000001s)]
*  may be attacking into the orexin system, [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8219.5s)]
*  is serving as a signal, kind of like a panic attack does, [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8223.02s)]
*  that there's something weird, something different, [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8226.380000000001s)]
*  or being revved up, and that it's, I think, [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8228.66s)]
*  secondarily triggering the sympathetic system. [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8231.06s)]
*  Because for most of those people, within a few trials, [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8234.34s)]
*  within a few days, they no longer had [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8237.02s)]
*  that over revved effect. [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8240.26s)]
*  And again, the important piece for alerting people to that [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8242.42s)]
*  is if they're expecting taking this, [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8247.3s)]
*  I'm not gonna feel over-aroused and over-agitated, [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8248.82s)]
*  and they do, then they're even less prepared [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8253.14s)]
*  and more freaked out. [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8255.34s)]
*  Even though I've never tried modafinil provigil, [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8256.74s)]
*  that people that I know who have, [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8258.98s)]
*  and I know one who has for treatment of real narcolepsy, [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8261.5s)]
*  so he's narcoleptic, but others who have, [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8267.14s)]
*  take it for ADHD and for work focus [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8270.74s)]
*  and cognitive enhancement, [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8273.039999999999s)]
*  people who take modafinil and armodafinil really like it. [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8276.64s)]
*  I don't know if it has any reinforcing property, [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8281.34s)]
*  but today is the first that I've heard [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8283.18s)]
*  that has this dopaminergic aspect. [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8285.02s)]
*  But they seem to really like it and rely on it. [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8287.54s)]
*  Have you seen a kind of a dependence form? [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8290.220000000001s)]
*  I mean, it is a controlled substance [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8292.62s)]
*  because some people are worried about the potential. [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8296.2s)]
*  And there was a woman Olympic athlete 20, 15 years ago [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8298.82s)]
*  who was had modafinil and said she had narcolepsy, [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8302.66s)]
*  I don't know, but was disqualified from the Olympics [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8306.060000000001s)]
*  because of it. [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8310.060000000001s)]
*  Whether it has any real performance enhancing effects [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8311.5s)]
*  is not clear. [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8314.5s)]
*  It was available in France for a decade, [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8316.18s)]
*  at least before it came to the US, [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8318.78s)]
*  and they didn't see any rates of substance abuse or problems. [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8320.6s)]
*  I mean, it clearly does not have on any tests [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8324.82s)]
*  or animal studies the propensity that the amphetamines do. [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8328.42s)]
*  And I'd say it's, to me, not to conclude its subject, [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8333.74s)]
*  whether there's any potential for addiction with it. [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8337.64s)]
*  What about within the category of Adderall, Vivance, [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8342.32s)]
*  and the stimulant type treatments for ADHD? [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8347.4s)]
*  I don't want to say what are your go-to favorites [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8351.16s)]
*  because that makes it sound very non-clinical. [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8353.119999999999s)]
*  But what are the general trends that you've observed [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8357.24s)]
*  and that others have observed clinically or in any studies [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8362.039999999999s)]
*  about preference for long-acting drugs [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8365.18s)]
*  versus shorter-acting drugs? [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8368.96s)]
*  And maybe this is also a good opportunity [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8370.96s)]
*  for you to be able to chime in about drug holidays, [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8373.08s)]
*  taking weekends off or things of that sort. [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8377.48s)]
*  Maybe I'll start with that. [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8381.56s)]
*  So for decades, particularly starting with kids, [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8382.759999999998s)]
*  the dogma has been taking breaks from stimulants [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8387.56s)]
*  is a good idea because it will decrease the likelihood [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8390.72s)]
*  of developing addictions, it will decrease tolerance, [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8394.16s)]
*  and not a lot of rigorous research, [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8397.4s)]
*  but one of the known side effects of stimulants for kids [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8401.68s)]
*  is growth suppression. [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8405.279999999999s)]
*  So height winds up being about two centimeters, [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8407.16s)]
*  not big, but measurably and consistently found there [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8410.199999999999s)]
*  for kids who are routinely on the stimulants [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8413.74s)]
*  for their growth years. [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8417.779999999999s)]
*  And taking breaks that last for several months, [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8421.84s)]
*  like taking it off during the summer, [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8426.06s)]
*  result in overcoming that decrement in height. [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8428.019999999999s)]
*  I looked and I still haven't, [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8432.019999999999s)]
*  whether there's any lower rate of addiction, [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8433.619999999999s)]
*  whether there's any lower rate of developing tolerance, [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8436.699999999999s)]
*  there's nothing that shows clinically. [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8439.859999999999s)]
*  I mean, it may be true. [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8441.779999999999s)]
*  The other recommendation when I started out was, [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8443.34s)]
*  and this is before the internet, [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8446.06s)]
*  before constant plugged into everything, [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8447.48s)]
*  and before kids had soccer practice and violin lessons [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8450.18s)]
*  and 400 activities is that kids should take it [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8453.9s)]
*  during the work days and not take it during the weekends [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8456.46s)]
*  and not take it during the summers. [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8459.22s)]
*  And now, and for many years, we've lived in a world [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8461.38s)]
*  where little Johnny has soccer practice and ballet [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8464.779999999999s)]
*  and piano and has 42 things to get to [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8468.539999999999s)]
*  where he's supposed to be performing [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8472.42s)]
*  and focused and behaving. [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8474.26s)]
*  So the sort of excuse you could have downtime [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8477.14s)]
*  has diminished in many communities. [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8481.08s)]
*  And again, whether there's actual benefits to that or not, [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8483.54s)]
*  other than for the height decrement, [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8487.76s)]
*  which again, there is evidence that taking long breaks, [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8491.26s)]
*  but probably not short breaks, mitigates that. [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8494.78s)]
*  I haven't seen any evidence clearly showing a benefit. [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8498.140000000001s)]
*  That doesn't mean it's not there. [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8502.220000000001s)]
*  Nobody has really studied it rigorously. [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8503.54s)]
*  Sort of related to that, [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8506.740000000002s)]
*  you asked the question about short acting [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8508.900000000001s)]
*  versus long acting. [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8510.42s)]
*  And there's differences in the realm [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8512.88s)]
*  of what's clinically helpful or useful, [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8516.599999999999s)]
*  and then there's the issue of risks or side effects. [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8518.64s)]
*  So again, one of the claims is that part of what makes a drug [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8521.24s)]
*  more addictive is not just the level it reaches, [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8524.96s)]
*  but how quickly it's going in and out, [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8527.679999999998s)]
*  and that the short acting drugs may predispose someone [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8529.519999999999s)]
*  to higher rates of addiction. [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8533.119999999999s)]
*  There are at least occasionally some people arguing [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8535.759999999998s)]
*  on the other side that saturating the receptors [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8538.64s)]
*  for longer periods of time, but high doses, [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8542.4s)]
*  but the long extended release version, [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8545.199999999999s)]
*  that may actually be more of a risk, [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8548.199999999999s)]
*  but I'd say there's more concern, I think, [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8550.48s)]
*  in the basic science community from the immediate relisk. [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8553.46s)]
*  And there's a tiny bit of data, [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8557.72s)]
*  but part of it overall is that, [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8559.88s)]
*  we talked earlier about global rates of addiction [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8563.359999999999s)]
*  to any substance. [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8565.72s)]
*  That we have fairly good data on, [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8567.84s)]
*  because the CDC tracks it, [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8569.36s)]
*  but in terms of very specifically, [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8570.880000000001s)]
*  who gets addicted to Adderall, [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8572.880000000001s)]
*  who gets addicted to Iridolin, [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8574.8s)]
*  there's so little data, [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8577.64s)]
*  and most people just sort the same numbers, [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8579.56s)]
*  that oh, maybe 2% to 3% of kids run into trouble, [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8581.92s)]
*  and it's not common, and that's it. [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8584.76s)]
*  Or they study a much broader question, [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8588.28s)]
*  and that's the issue of misuse combined with abuse. [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8591.16s)]
*  And misuse by the research definitions means, [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8595.36s)]
*  anyone who didn't use their drug exactly as prescribed, [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8598.960000000001s)]
*  which means if you're taking a short acting Iridolin, [[02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8603.52s)]
*  and it says, take it one every six, [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8606.240000000002s)]
*  or six hours apart during the day, [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8609.36s)]
*  and you acknowledge taking it on one day, [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8612.18s)]
*  eight hours difference, [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8614.16s)]
*  you're classified as a misuser by those studies. [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8615.34s)]
*  I mean, I'm being maybe a little ridiculous, [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8618.04s)]
*  because most of the exceptions aren't that narrow, [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8621.68s)]
*  but there's a big blurring in the research, [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8625.4s)]
*  particularly coming from the people [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8628.92s)]
*  who are worried about addiction. [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8630.4s)]
*  I mean, we should be worried about addiction, [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8631.4s)]
*  but we shouldn't be overreacting or creating, [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8633.36s)]
*  pretending it's a problem among those [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8637.2s)]
*  where that I would say is not addiction. [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8639.36s)]
*  That's not abuse. [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8643.960000000001s)]
*  That's not using it as directed, [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8645.32s)]
*  but people with ADHD by their very nature [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8648.36s)]
*  are not gonna use things as directed, [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8651.44s)]
*  either because they forgot, [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8653.44s)]
*  or weren't organized enough to get it on time, [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8655.08s)]
*  or forgot what you said in the office, [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8658.880000000001s)]
*  even though you wrote it down, [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8661.08s)]
*  because they lost a sheet of paper it's written down on. [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8662.380000000001s)]
*  So getting back to patients' experience of it. [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8665.0s)]
*  So the advantages of the immediate release [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8668.12s)]
*  is they tend to work quickly. [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8670.36s)]
*  You can feel it going in. [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8672.04s)]
*  It's easily most people, [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8674.68s)]
*  there's a lot of individual variability, [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8677.880000000001s)]
*  but let's say in the six to eight hour range [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8679.76s)]
*  we'll get benefit. [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8681.599999999999s)]
*  Some shorter, some immediate release lasts all day, [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8682.92s)]
*  but you know when it's on, you know when it's off. [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8687.0s)]
*  If you forget to take your medicines in the morning, [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8689.679999999998s)]
*  but you know you have a presentation at three [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8692.0s)]
*  that afternoon, you could take it at two [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8694.599999999999s)]
*  and still be able to sleep that night. [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8697.439999999999s)]
*  So it allows more flexibility, [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8699.64s)]
*  it allows more pinpointing of optimizing it [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8702.16s)]
*  for points of the day you want to be using it. [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8706.279999999999s)]
*  Some people philosophically say that in itself [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8710.359999999999s)]
*  is wrong or bad, that you should be absolutely steady [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8712.92s)]
*  and constant, because what we're trying to do [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8715.279999999999s)]
*  is be consistent and reproducible, [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8717.039999999999s)]
*  and others would say we're trying to treat individuals [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8719.679999999998s)]
*  who have different demands on them [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8723.08s)]
*  and have different patterns during their day. [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8724.599999999999s)]
*  So there are different philosophies [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8726.8s)]
*  about what's better or worse. [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8728.4s)]
*  One of the big downsides of the immediate release though [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8730.279999999999s)]
*  is not only does it go in quickly, [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8732.8s)]
*  it tends to go off quickly, [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8734.679999999998s)]
*  and most people, not all, but most experience [[02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8736.48s)]
*  some withdrawal as it's going off. [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8739.88s)]
*  And although when we're using this for ADHD, [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8742.279999999999s)]
*  we focus on the cognitive executive function, [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8744.52s)]
*  benefits, the focus, the attention, the concentration, [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8747.68s)]
*  and people can experience that. [[02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8750.96s)]
*  Many people who weren't even aware of it [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8752.84s)]
*  increasing their energy feel my energy's crashing [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8756.32s)]
*  as I go off of it, or many people who weren't aware [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8759.92s)]
*  that it was actually elevating mood to any extent [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8762.8s)]
*  feel oh my god, I'm crashing and I'm crying [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8765.16s)]
*  and cranky and miserable now. [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8767.96s)]
*  And with the extended release versions, [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8770.2s)]
*  most of them go in more gradually, [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8772.84s)]
*  so it can be harder to detect, [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8775.68s)]
*  they last a longer period of the day, [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8777.32s)]
*  and most of them go out much more gradually [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8780.08s)]
*  at the end of the day. [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8783.28s)]
*  The one I like the most for a long-acting amphetamine [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8784.4s)]
*  product is Vivance, and Vivance was designed [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8788.36s)]
*  as a slow-release product. [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8792.88s)]
*  It was designed specifically to be unattractive [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8794.84s)]
*  to drug abusers. [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8798.199999999999s)]
*  So Vivance chemically links a dexoramphetamine molecule [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8799.56s)]
*  to lysine, one of the amino acids, [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8803.64s)]
*  it's a basic component of proteins [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8805.92s)]
*  and 20 essential amino acids. [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8808.519999999999s)]
*  And if you snored it or inject it, [[02:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8810.92s)]
*  you have an inactive prodrug, [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8815.96s)]
*  you have the Lys-dexamphetamine. [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8817.72s)]
*  Your red blood cells actually have an enzyme [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8821.92s)]
*  that cleaves the lysine and leaves you [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8825.12s)]
*  with the free active dexoramphetamine, [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8827.24s)]
*  and that's the slow-release mechanism [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8829.48s)]
*  is how quickly your red blood cells can do it, [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8832.56s)]
*  and they have limited capacity to do that. [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8835.28s)]
*  So although they designed it to be a anti-drug abuse drug, [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8837.56s)]
*  it actually turns out to be one of the sort of [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8842.48s)]
*  most consistently evenly entering the body. [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8845.08s)]
*  For some people, it goes in so slowly [[02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8848.56s)]
*  that they say, I don't feel it. [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8850.64s)]
*  And also, towards the end of the day, [[02:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8854.0s)]
*  one of the best in terms of not falling off abruptly, [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8855.76s)]
*  the potential downside is again, [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8861.88s)]
*  that the capacity of the red blood cells is limited, [[02:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8863.68s)]
*  so at some point, for most people, [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8866.16s)]
*  because that's a rate-limiting step, [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8869.119999999999s)]
*  when you're adding more and more, [[02:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8870.68s)]
*  you're actually extending the duration of time [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8872.6s)]
*  more than you're getting a bigger peak, [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8875.56s)]
*  because your red blood cells just aren't cleaving it [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8877.08s)]
*  fast enough to make more dexoramphetamine available. [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8879.4s)]
*  Almost invariably, when I'll ask, [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8883.52s)]
*  how did this compare to your Adderall XR, [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8885.84s)]
*  or to Adhansi, or to, they'll say smooth. [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8887.88s)]
*  Smooth. [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8891.56s)]
*  They're getting it, they're not feeling too jarred, [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8893.199999999999s)]
*  too revved up. [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8895.68s)]
*  Yeah, we don't really have a language for these things, [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8896.96s)]
*  right, hence the bad speed language [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8899.16s)]
*  before cracked out, bad speed, smooth. [[02:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8905.16s)]
*  Because what we're talking about here is the gestalt [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8910.08s)]
*  of the subjective experience of all these neural [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8912.24s)]
*  and chemical mechanisms. [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8915.68s)]
*  Very interesting, thank you for sharing that. [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8918.76s)]
*  I know that there are a lot of listeners and viewers [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8920.44s)]
*  who have tried these things, or who are considering, [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8923.24s)]
*  or at one point used them, and a lot has evolved [[02:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8926.0s)]
*  in this realm of chemistry for ADHD, [[02:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8930.44s)]
*  but that's very helpful. [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8933.32s)]
*  Before we wrap up, I want to make sure [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8935.92s)]
*  that I ask you about something that's been on my mind [[02:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8938.16s)]
*  a lot in general, but in particular as it relates to ADHD, [[02:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8940.36s)]
*  which is time perception. [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8944.76s)]
*  And I'm basically obsessed with time perception. [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8947.16s)]
*  I've long been fascinated by the fact [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8949.84s)]
*  that we can find slice time when our arousal is high, [[02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8951.8s)]
*  that's what presumably gives people [[02:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8954.92s)]
*  the kind of slow motion effect [[02:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8956.6s)]
*  in very stressful environments, versus when we're relaxed, [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8957.92s)]
*  our frame rate on life goes down, [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8961.72s)]
*  and it's all very dynamic, it's important our brains [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8963.44s)]
*  are able to do that. [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8966.2s)]
*  But someone recently told me the following. [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8967.04s)]
*  Her partner has ADHD, and she said that the big rescue [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8970.480000000001s)]
*  to their relationship came when they together [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8975.36s)]
*  read a book about ADHD, and something in there [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8979.04s)]
*  read something like this, that people without ADHD [[02:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8982.960000000001s)]
*  keep track of time, whereas people with ADHD don't, [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8986.640000000001s)]
*  but they do know the difference between now and not now, [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8992.080000000002s)]
*  but they're not tracking time. [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8995.560000000001s)]
*  They know that what they're doing in the moment [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8997.68s)]
*  is not what they're going to be doing later, [[02:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8998.52s)]
*  or what they did in the past, [[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9000.0s)]
*  but they're not tracking time the same way. [[02:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9001.28s)]
*  And I think this ties back to this [[02:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9004.0s)]
*  interest-based attention system. [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9005.28s)]
*  What do we know about time perception in ADHD, [[02:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9008.0s)]
*  and by extension, do you think that these drugs [[02:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9011.16s)]
*  are working in part to change time perception? [[02:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9013.72s)]
*  Good question. [[02:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9017.28s)]
*  So I'd say there's two different angles, [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9019.16s)]
*  and I think the one that's easier to objectively measure [[02:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9021.52s)]
*  is putting people in a lab, and there's a simple test, [[02:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9024.68s)]
*  a time perception test, and you interrupt them [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9028.800000000001s)]
*  after a certain period. [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9031.84s)]
*  I mean, say you're going to be estimating [[02:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9032.76s)]
*  how long you're left without interruption, [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9034.720000000001s)]
*  and people with ADHD, they're inconsistently inconsistent, [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9038.44s)]
*  or consistent, sorry, consistently inconsistent. [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9045.24s)]
*  So it's not that they perpetually underestimate [[02:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9048.16s)]
*  or overestimate, but they are estimating incorrectly [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9050.68s)]
*  much more often than people without ADHD. [[02:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9055.52s)]
*  So there's something at a basic time processing level [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9057.84s)]
*  that's aberrant there, but there's also getting, [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9064.36s)]
*  you know, the real world aspect of not paying attention [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9067.56s)]
*  to cues, or not noticing other people have left the room, [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9071.56s)]
*  or not being distracted, which compounds a situation, [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9074.12s)]
*  and I mean, it's also interesting to the extent [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9079.28s)]
*  to which many people aren't aware. [[02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9082.76s)]
*  So I often ask, even though it's not one of the 18 symptoms, [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9084.24s)]
*  are you chronically late to them, [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9089.28s)]
*  and particularly people who show up late to my office [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9091.04s)]
*  time after time. [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9093.36s)]
*  So one of my favorite quotes is this person who, [[02:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9094.28s)]
*  the session before, we had been talking that her boss [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9099.52s)]
*  was giving her threatening notices, [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9101.92s)]
*  because she had come in two hours late one day, [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9104.960000000001s)]
*  and she had all sorts of good excuses [[02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9107.84s)]
*  of why she couldn't get out the door. [[02:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9109.48s)]
*  And we were talking, you know, are you regularly late? [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9111.36s)]
*  No, no, no, and I said, well, why was the boss so upset? [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9114.960000000001s)]
*  And then I asked, well, when is the expectation, [[02:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9118.68s)]
*  this was pre-COVID, pre-working, [[02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9121.6s)]
*  when is the expectation you're there, [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9123.640000000001s)]
*  when do you usually show up? [[02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9125.08s)]
*  Oh, well, office starts at nine, [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9126.52s)]
*  and I'm usually there by 9.15, 9.20, that's not late. [[02:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9128.720000000001s)]
*  In her mind, it wasn't late. [[02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9133.800000000001s)]
*  So, you know, and so when you ask a question, [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9135.92s)]
*  are you routinely late? [[02:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9139.12s)]
*  You're gonna get meaningless information [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9140.36s)]
*  on your little checklist, [[02:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9142.44s)]
*  unless you know what that means to the individual. [[02:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9143.560000000001s)]
*  So the second part of the question, [[02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9146.6s)]
*  I'm sure it's been done, and I don't have the answer, [[02:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9149.2s)]
*  whether stimulants or other drugs [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9152.800000000001s)]
*  measurably improve time perception [[02:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9154.44s)]
*  in that laboratory situation of just, [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9156.68s)]
*  can you estimate how much time has elapsed? [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9159.400000000001s)]
*  I should know that, but I don't have that on top of my, [[02:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9162.480000000001s)]
*  and the more global question of how central [[02:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9166.68s)]
*  that's sort of the time aspect of organization [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9171.0s)]
*  of thoughts and attention as to [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9174.0s)]
*  the content of disorganization. [[02:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9176.800000000001s)]
*  I mean, there are some research groups, [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9180.48s)]
*  I think it's mainly a Danish group, [[02:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9183.960000000001s)]
*  who's feeling that ADHD is primarily [[02:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9186.08s)]
*  a circadian rhythm disruption, [[02:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9188.92s)]
*  that that's the central neurologic issue at play. [[02:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9191.04s)]
*  And there's interesting, I got to do work in the early 80s [[02:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9194.64s)]
*  on bright light therapy for winter depression, [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9200.439999999999s)]
*  which has a measurable impact as strong as medication, [[02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9202.92s)]
*  but there is one or two studies done on individuals with ADHD [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9207.359999999999s)]
*  without any seasonal depression, [[02:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9212.119999999999s)]
*  without any depression at all, [[02:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9213.8s)]
*  and just those same bright lights showing them, [[02:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9215.64s)]
*  you know, a dose of bright lights early in the morning [[02:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9218.76s)]
*  measurably improved a broad range of ADHD symptoms. [[02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9222.2s)]
*  And the claim was that that was working [[02:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9226.400000000001s)]
*  because it was helping resynchronize internal rhythms, [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9228.320000000002s)]
*  which are out of sync in ADHD, [[02:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9232.44s)]
*  whether that's exactly the same thing you were getting at, [[02:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9234.720000000001s)]
*  but certainly if you have, I mean, [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9237.12s)]
*  even though we have a sort of master clock [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9239.16s)]
*  in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, [[02:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9241.6s)]
*  we also have clocks throughout our body [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9244.08s)]
*  and they're talking and interacting [[02:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9247.16s)]
*  ostensibly synchronized and working with each other, [[02:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9249.199999999999s)]
*  but it could well be that for many people they're not [[02:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9252.359999999999s)]
*  and that getting that to work is essential. [[02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9255.119999999999s)]
*  Thank you for those reflections. [[02:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9258.8s)]
*  And really I want to say thank you on behalf of myself [[02:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9260.24s)]
*  and everyone listening and watching [[02:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9264.119999999999s)]
*  for doing the work you do. [[02:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9265.519999999999s)]
*  You were invited here today [[02:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9267.64s)]
*  because you have an absolutely encyclopedic understanding [[02:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9269.039999999999s)]
*  and knowledge of ADHD and the clinical treatments [[02:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9273.76s)]
*  and I've watched your YouTube channel [[02:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9276.76s)]
*  and we'll provide links to all your various resources. [[02:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9279.039999999999s)]
*  I'm looking forward to your upcoming book, [[02:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9280.52s)]
*  however long it takes. [[02:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9283.039999999999s)]
*  I'm sure it'll be spectacular. [[02:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9285.0s)]
*  When you talk about ADHD, [[02:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9288.08s)]
*  you're able to do it from so many different angles, [[02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9289.72s)]
*  behavioral, supplement-based, nutrition, [[02:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9293.119999999999s)]
*  life and organizational, life organizational aspects. [[02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9296.0s)]
*  And of course the medication, the pharmacology, [[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9300.92s)]
*  the neuroscience and the ways that those different nodes [[02:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9302.76s)]
*  interact with one another, [[02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9306.4s)]
*  because of course they do. [[02:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9307.52s)]
*  So I just want to be absolutely clear how grateful we are [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9308.560000000001s)]
*  for you for sharing all this knowledge. [[02:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9312.960000000001s)]
*  A lot of people struggle with attention issues [[02:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9314.52s)]
*  regardless of whether or not they have a full-blown ADHD [[02:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9316.960000000001s)]
*  or not a lot of people have been treated for it. [[02:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9319.52s)]
*  Some people are still wondering if they should be or not. [[02:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9321.32s)]
*  And so today's discussion was nothing short of spectacular. [[02:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9323.76s)]
*  So on behalf of everybody, [[02:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9327.560000000001s)]

*  for more than five years, [[02:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9385.28s)]

*  of research and experience. [[02:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9388.76s)]

*  to exercise to stress control, [[02:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9393.36s)]
