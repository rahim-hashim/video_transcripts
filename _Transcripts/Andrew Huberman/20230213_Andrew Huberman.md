# Dr. Gina Poe: Use Sleep to Enhance Learning, Memory & Emotional State | Huberman Lab Podcast
**Andrew Huberman:** [February 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMTt8gSl13s)
*  Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
*  where we discuss science
*  and science-based tools for everyday life.
*  I'm Andrew Huberman,
*  and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
*  at Stanford School of Medicine.
*  Today, my guest is Dr. Gina Po.
*  Dr. Gina Po is a professor
*  in the Department of Integrative Biology and Physiology
*  at the University of California, Los Angeles.
*  Her laboratory and research focuses on the relationship
*  between sleep and learning,
*  in particular, how specific patterns of brain activity
*  that are present during specific phases of sleep
*  impact our ability to learn
*  and remember specific types of information.
*  For instance, procedural information,
*  that is how to perform specific cognitive or physical tasks,
*  as well as encoding of emotional memories
*  and discarding emotional memories.
*  Indeed, her research focuses on how specific phases of sleep
*  can act as its own form of trauma therapy,
*  discarding the emotional tones of memories.
*  In addition, her laboratory focuses
*  on how specific phases of sleep impact things
*  like the release of growth hormone.
*  Growth hormone, of course, plays critical roles
*  in metabolism and tissue repair,
*  including brain tissue repair,
*  and therefore has critical roles in vitality and longevity.
*  Today, you will learn many things
*  about the relationship between sleep, learning,
*  emotionality, and growth hormone.
*  One basic but very important takeaway
*  that you'll learn about today, which was news to me,
*  is that it's not just the duration and depth
*  of your sleep that matter,
*  but actually getting to sleep
*  at relatively the same time each night
*  ensures that you get adequate growth hormone release
*  in the first hours of sleep.
*  In fact, if you require, let's say,
*  eight hours of sleep per night,
*  but you go to sleep two hours later
*  than your typical bedtime on any given night,
*  you actually miss the window for growth hormone release.
*  That's right.
*  Getting growth hormone release in sleep,
*  which is absolutely critical
*  to our immediate and long-term health,
*  is not a prerequisite of getting sleep,
*  even if we are getting enough sleep.
*  As Dr. Poe explains, there are critical brain circuits
*  and endocrine, that is hormone circuits,
*  that regulate not just the duration and depth
*  and quality and timing of sleep,
*  but when we place our bout of sleep,
*  that is when we go to sleep each night,
*  plus or minus about a half hour or so,
*  strongly dictates whether or not we will experience
*  all the health promoting,
*  including mind promoting, benefits of sleep.
*  Today's episode covers that
*  and a lot more in substantial detail.
*  You will learn, for instance,
*  how to use sleep in order to optimize learning,
*  as well as forgetting for those things
*  that you would like to forget.
*  So during today's episode,
*  Dr. Gina Poe shares critical information
*  about not just neuroscience, but physiology
*  and the hormone systems of the brain and body
*  that strongly inform mental health,
*  physical health and performance.
*  So by the end of today's episode,
*  you'll be far more informed about sleep and how it works,
*  the different roles it performs,
*  and you'll have several new actionable steps
*  that you can take in order to improve your mental health,
*  physical health and performance.
*  Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
*  is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
*  It is, however, part of my desire and effort
*  to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
*  and science-related tools to the general public.
*  In keeping with that theme,
*  I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
*  Our first sponsor is Element.
*  Element is an electrolyte drink
*  that has everything you need and nothing you don't.
*  That means plenty of salt, magnesium and potassium,
*  the so-called electrolytes, and no sugar.
*  Now, the electrolytes are critical to the function
*  of every cell in your body,
*  in particular, the neurons, the nerve cells.
*  So I've talked about before on this podcast,
*  neurons, nerve cells, require adequate sodium and potassium
*  as well as magnesium in order to fire action potentials,
*  which are the electrical signals
*  that allow neurons to do everything
*  from generate focus and attention, allow you to learn,
*  and generate neuromuscular connection
*  and allow you to exercise or train
*  or do any kind of skilled activity
*  with a high degree of output.
*  I take Element about two or three times per day,
*  typically once in the morning and again after
*  or during my bout of exercise each day,
*  and sometimes an additional one
*  if I've sat in a hot sauna and sweat a lot
*  or if the weather is very hot.
*  If you'd like to try Element, you can go to Drink Element,
*  that's lmnt.com slash Huberman
*  to claim a free Element sample pack with your purchase.
*  Again, that's Drink Element, lmnt.com slash Huberman
*  to claim a free sample pack.
*  Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep.
*  Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows
*  that are the absolute highest quality.
*  Now sleep is the foundation of mental health,
*  physical health and performance.
*  When we are sleeping well, all of those things excel.
*  And when we are not sleeping well,
*  all of those things suffer.
*  Now the surface that you sleep on,
*  that is the mattress that you sleep on is critical.
*  And Helix understands that everybody
*  has slightly different sleep needs.
*  So if you were to go to the Helix site,
*  which I invite you to do,
*  and take their brief two minute quiz,
*  it will match your body type and sleep preferences
*  to the perfect mattress for you.
*  It will ask you questions, for instance,
*  do you sleep on your back or your side or your stomach?
*  Do you tend to run hot or cold during the night?
*  Or maybe you don't know the answers to those questions.
*  I went and took the sleep quiz at Helix
*  and it matched me to the so-called Dusk mattress, D-U-S-K.
*  I started sleeping on a Dusk mattress over a year ago
*  and it's the best sleep that I've ever had.
*  It's completely transformed the depth and duration
*  and quality of my sleep in ways that make me feel
*  far better during the daytime.
*  If you're interested in upgrading your mattress,
*  you can go to helixsleep.com slash Huberman,
*  take their two minute sleep quiz
*  and they'll match you to a customized mattress
*  and you'll get up to $350 off any mattress order
*  and two free pillows.
*  Again, if interested, go to helixsleep.com slash Huberman
*  for up to $350 off and two free pillows.
*  Today's episode is also brought to us by 8 Sleep.
*  8 Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling,
*  heating and sleep tracking capacity.
*  Now, again, sleep is the foundation of mental health,
*  physical health and performance,
*  but what many people don't realize is that
*  in order to fall and stay asleep,
*  your core body temperature has to drop
*  by about one to three degrees.
*  Conversely, in order to wake up each morning
*  and feel refreshed, your body temperature
*  actually has to increase by one to three degrees.
*  Therefore, controlling the temperature
*  of your sleeping environment is absolutely key.
*  With 8 Sleep, that's very easy to do.
*  Depending on whether or not you typically run too cold
*  or too hot during the night,
*  you can program your 8 Sleep mattress cover
*  so that it's the optimal temperature,
*  not just for you, but for each phase,
*  the early, middle and late phase of your sleep
*  and for waking up in the morning.
*  In fact, you can even control the temperature
*  of your 8 Sleep mattress cover differentially
*  across the mattress if you're sleeping
*  alongside somebody else.
*  If you'd like to try 8 Sleep,
*  you can go to 8sleep.com slash Huberman
*  and check out their Pod Pro cover
*  and save $150 at checkout.
*  8 Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, UK
*  and select countries in the EU and Australia.

*  The Huberman Lab podcast is now partnered
*  with Momentous Supplements.
*  To find the supplements we discuss
*  on the Huberman Lab podcast,
*  you can go to Live Momentous spelled O-U-S,
*  livemomentous.com slash Huberman.
*  And I should just mention that the library
*  of those supplements is constantly expanding.
*  Again, that's livemomentous.com slash Huberman.
*  And now for my discussion with Dr. Gina Po.
*  Dr. Gina Po, welcome.
*  Thank you.
*  I've really been looking forward to this conversation
*  because I'm familiar with your work
*  and I know that many people are going to be excited
*  to learn about your work as it relates to sleep,
*  as it relates to problem solving,
*  creativity, addiction and craving, relapse,
*  and a number of other important topics.
*  So to start things off, I would love for you
*  to educate us a bit about this thing
*  that we are all familiar with
*  and yet very few of us understand, which is sleep.
*  And if you would, could you describe the various phases
*  of sleep that exist, what distinguished them,
*  and perhaps frame this within the context
*  of what would a perfect night's sleep look like?
*  How long would it last more or less?
*  And what would the biology look like?
*  What is a perfect night's sleep?
*  Oh yeah, that's a great question.
*  All right, so sleep is really different from wakefulness.
*  And in fact, can't be replaced by any state of wakefulness
*  that we've been able to come up with so far.
*  Our brain chemistry is completely different
*  and in the different stages of sleep,
*  which there are is non-REM and REM
*  are the two major states of sleep.
*  And every animal we've studied so far
*  seems to have both of those states.
*  Anyway, those two states are entirely different
*  from one another too.
*  And even within non-REM, there are three states.
*  Stage one, which is what you slip into
*  when you first falling asleep, it's dozing,
*  there's kind of an interesting rhythm
*  that goes on in the brain, it's kind of a fast gamma rhythm.
*  And then there's stage two, which is a really cool state.
*  We sort of used to ignore sleep researchers
*  because it was a transient state between wakefulness
*  and the deep stage three, slow-wave sleep,
*  which is the most impressively different.
*  And then, and between that and REM sleep.
*  So stage two, I'll talk a little bit more about.
*  And then the deep slow-wave sleep state,
*  which is when big slow waves sweep through our brain
*  and now we realize that it cleans our brain.
*  One of the things that those big slow waves do
*  is cleans our brain and does other really important things
*  to restore us from a day of wakefulness.
*  And then REM sleep, which is the most popular
*  because that's where we have the most active dreams
*  and when you wake up someone out of REM sleep,
*  they'll almost always report having dreamed
*  something really bizarre.
*  That's called REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep.
*  So those are the four states of sleep, of human sleep,
*  and we cycle through them every 90 minutes or so.
*  When we go to sleep, say 10, 10.30, 11 o'clock,
*  our first REM sleep period comes about 105 minutes
*  after we fall asleep and lasts about 20 minutes.
*  Actually, it comes about 95 minutes
*  and lasts 10 or 15 minutes.
*  And then we start over again.
*  And we have about five of those per night
*  for perfect night's sleep.
*  Four or five, something like that.
*  So a perfect night's sleep is seven and a half, eight hours.
*  There was a really great study that put people
*  in a semi-darkened room with nothing but the bed
*  for 12 hours every day for a month.
*  And what people did initially is because we're
*  in a sleep deprived nation is that they slept a lot more
*  than usual, like 10 or 11 hours of the 12.
*  And then they leveled off after a week or two
*  to about eight hours and 15 minutes of sleep.
*  So you actually can't oversleep.
*  I mean, they had nothing else to do but sleep
*  and they would round off to on average eight hours
*  and 15 minutes a night.
*  And then they spend the rest of the time
*  twiddling their thumbs, humming tunes, daydreaming.
*  I want to get back to the contour of a perfect night's sleep
*  but I'm intrigued by this idea that people can't oversleep.
*  I'm often asked whether or not we can get too much sleep
*  and whether or not sleeping too long, excuse me,
*  can make us groggy the next day.
*  Is there anything to that?
*  And how does one determine how long they should sleep
*  on average?
*  On average, yeah.
*  Well, that's interesting because different people
*  seem to need different amounts of sleep
*  but we don't really even know exactly what sleep is for.
*  So what they need is kind of murky.
*  So we do know a lot of things that sleep does now for us
*  but we don't know how long those things take.
*  So how long we need to sleep is also just a big question mark
*  but some people don't feel rested
*  until they've slept nine hours.
*  Some people don't feel rested after three or four and a half
*  but most people, if they consistently deprive themselves
*  of sleep so that they're only sleeping
*  four or four and a half hours a night,
*  build up a cognitive deficit that just builds up over time
*  the more nights you have with sleep deprivation,
*  the more cognitive deficit you have
*  and so you need sleep again to sleep more to recover.
*  Now the question you had about...
*  Can you oversleep?
*  Can you oversleep, right.
*  Can you sleep to the point where it's too much?
*  Growing up when I was in high school,
*  my girlfriend's dad had this belief
*  that no one should sleep in past 6 a.m.
*  So he would wake all the...
*  There were two children in that home.
*  He would wake up the kids in that house.
*  He had to sing against oversleeping
*  regardless of when people went to sleep
*  and I always thought that was an interesting mentality.
*  Yeah, it's not terrible actually
*  because what that will do is it'll make you sleep
*  the next night to get to bed on time.
*  So it'll build up your homeostatic need
*  if you wake up too early.
*  So I don't think you can oversleep
*  but people who sleep a lot,
*  like people who sleep over nine hours,
*  it's probably indicative of some other problem
*  because in fact if you have a lot of different conditions
*  it will cause you to sleep a lot more
*  probably because what it does is it interferes
*  with your efficient sleep, the efficiency of your sleep.
*  So if you find yourself sleeping consistently
*  nine hours plus every night,
*  then you might want to consult a doctor about
*  maybe what else it might be.
*  It could be cancer, it could be sleep apnea
*  that affects a lot of people.
*  It could be that your sleep is super inefficient
*  because you're snoring a lot more than you know
*  or you're waking up a lot more than you know every night.
*  So you might want to sleep steady
*  just to see how your sleep is
*  and then see what else might be causing you to sleep so much.
*  And that wouldn't be if somebody is sleeping
*  nine or 10 hours every once in a while.
*  You mean if they're consistently sleeping
*  for more than nine hours.
*  If they feel like they need it in order to function
*  cognitively the next day,
*  it might be that your sleep is just not efficient
*  and you might want to look into why that's the case.
*  Interesting.
*  Forgive me for the anecdote but I can't resist.
*  Years ago I went to an acupuncturist
*  and he gave me these red pills
*  of which I don't know what they contained.
*  But I took them because he told me
*  they would help with my sleep.
*  And I would fall asleep about 30 minutes after taking them
*  and I would have incredibly vivid dreams
*  and I'd wake up four or five hours
*  after having gone to sleep feeling completely rested.
*  Something that I've never really experienced
*  on a consistent basis.
*  I want to do mass spec on these pills.
*  I still have no idea what was in them whatsoever.
*  You want to do mass spec on those pills too?
*  Exactly.
*  Some people have thought that perhaps they had GHB,
*  gamma hydroxybutyrate,
*  which is by the way an illegal drug.
*  It can kill you.
*  It's not something you want to take.
*  No, that's not good.
*  But anyway, if ever someone can figure out
*  what the red pills were, I'll be very...
*  That's really great.
*  And this is not a red pill of the other sort red pill.
*  This is just the red sleep pills.
*  Interesting.
*  I mean, it could have been even a placebo effect
*  because placebo is extremely strong.
*  Although I don't know.
*  There was really something to these red pills.
*  So shout out to the acupuncturists and the Eastern medicine.
*  But to return to this idea of the architecture
*  of a perfect night's sleep.
*  So you said we fall asleep,
*  the first 90 minutes of sleep, REM sleep,
*  rapid eye movement sleep will arrive at about 95 minutes in.
*  Does that mean that the rest of that 90 minutes
*  is consumed with slow wave sleep?
*  Yeah, non REM sleep.
*  And what about the sleep where we are lightly asleep
*  and we might have a dream that has us somehow thinking
*  about movement or that we jolt ourselves awake.
*  That often happens early in the night.
*  Yeah, that's the first stage, stage one and stage two sleep.
*  And stage two sleep is really cool
*  because that has something called sleep spindles
*  and K complexes.
*  And what sleep spindles are,
*  are a little of activity that's 10 to 15 Hertz in frequency.
*  It's a conversation between the thalamus and the cortex.
*  The gap thalamus is the gateway to consciousness.
*  And the neocortex processes all our cognition.
*  And so it's these spindles, they're called sleep spindles.
*  And if you wake up out of that state,
*  you will often report a dream,
*  like a hallucination style dream.
*  It won't be a long dream report
*  like you have out of REM sleep,
*  but it will be some hallucination state.
*  While we're falling asleep,
*  one of the reasons we call it falling asleep
*  is because in stage one and stage two,
*  our muscles are relaxing.
*  And if there's part of our brain that's conscious enough
*  to sort of recognize that relaxation,
*  we'll feel like we're falling and we'll jerk awake.
*  So often that hallucination,
*  it's called hypnagogic hallucination,
*  will feel like it'll include some falling aspect
*  that we'll wake up out of.
*  That's really interesting to me.
*  I've long felt that sensation
*  of almost like dropping back into my head.
*  So much so that if I elevate my feet just slightly
*  and I tilt my head back just slightly
*  in order to go to sleep,
*  I find that I fall asleep much faster.
*  But it does feel as if I'm going to fall
*  like almost going to do a backward somersault.
*  I actually really like the sensation
*  and usually because it proceeds falling deeply asleep.
*  Yeah, that's really interesting.
*  Somebody has to do a study of elevated feet.
*  Yeah, there's a little bit on body position and sleep
*  and some of the washout that we'll talk about.
*  So early in the night,
*  you got these lighter stages of sleep,
*  less rapid eye movement sleep.
*  What can we say about the dreams that occur during the,
*  say first and second 90 minute cycles of sleep?
*  Are they quite different than the patterns of sleep
*  and dreaming that occur later in the night or toward morning?
*  Well, okay, that's an interesting question.
*  There's a lot of facets to it.
*  There is some evidence that the first four hours of sleep
*  are very important for memory processing.
*  And in fact, if you've learned something new that day
*  or have experienced a new sensory motor experience,
*  then your early sleep dreams will incorporate
*  that experience much more than the later sleep dreams.
*  Later as that memory gets consolidated
*  from the early structures,
*  which are the hippocampus deep in the temporal lobe
*  to the cortex in a distributed fashion,
*  that memory seems to move from that hippocampus
*  to the cortex and also the dreams
*  that incorporate that memory also move later in the night.
*  So nobody knows why, but it does,
*  there was a great study by Siddhartha Ribeiro
*  who studied the consolidation of memories
*  from the hippocampus to the cortex in a rat
*  across the period of a full day sleep
*  because rats sleep in the daytime.
*  And he found that each subsequent REM sleep period
*  moved that memory from the hippocampus
*  to the first area that projects to it
*  and then the second area and then the third area.
*  And you can see the memory moving
*  throughout the sleep period.
*  Very cool study, I have to read that study.
*  So there's a number of different hormones
*  associated with the different stages of sleep.
*  We know that melatonin is a hormone.
*  Of nighttime. Of nighttime.
*  And it makes us sleepy.
*  What about growth hormone release?
*  When does that occur during sleep?
*  So growth hormone release happens all day long
*  and all night long, but the deep slow wave sleep
*  that you get the very first sleep cycle
*  is when you get a big bolus of growth hormone release
*  in men and women equally.
*  And if you miss that first deep slow wave sleep period,
*  you also miss that big bolus of growth hormone release.
*  And you might get ultimately across the day
*  just as much overall growth hormone release,
*  but endocrinologists will tell you that big boluses
*  do different things than a little bit eeked out over time.
*  So that is what we know there's also a big push
*  to synthesize proteins.
*  So that's when the protein synthesis part
*  that builds memories, for example, in our brain
*  happens in that first cycle of sleep.
*  So you don't want to miss that,
*  especially if you've learned something really big
*  and needs more synaptic space to encode it.
*  How would somebody miss that first 90 minutes?
*  Sleep driving themselves.
*  So let's say I normally go to sleep at 10 PM
*  and then from 10 to 11.30 would be this first phase
*  of sleep and that's when the big bolus
*  of growth hormone would be released.
*  Does that mean that if I go to sleep instead
*  at 11.30 or midnight that I missed that first phase
*  of sleep, why is it not the case that I get
*  that first phase of sleep just simply starting later?
*  It is a beautiful clock that we have in our body
*  that knows when things should happen.
*  And it's every cell in our body has a clock
*  and all of those clocks are normally synchronized
*  and the circadian clocks are synchronized.
*  And so our cells are ready to respond
*  to that growth hormone release at a particular time.
*  And if we miss it, and it's a time in relation
*  to melatonin also, so if you miss it,
*  yeah, you might get some growth hormone release,
*  but it's occurring at a time when that your clock
*  has already moved to the next phase.
*  And so it's just a clock thing.
*  Yeah, I don't think we can overstate the importance
*  of what you just described.
*  And to be honest, despite knowing a bit
*  about the sleep research and circadian biology,
*  this is the very first time that I've ever heard this,
*  that if you normally go to sleep at a particular time
*  and growth hormone is released in that first phase of sleep,
*  that you can't simply initiate your sleep bout later
*  and expect to capture that first phase of sleep.
*  Yeah.
*  That's incredible and I think important,
*  and as many listeners are probably realizing,
*  also highly actionable.
*  So what this means is that we should have
*  fairly consistent bedtimes
*  in addition to fairly consistent wake times.
*  Is that right? Yes, exactly.
*  And in fact, one of the best markers
*  of good neurological health when we get older
*  is consistent bedtimes.
*  Wow, okay.
*  I don't want to backtrack,
*  but I did write down something
*  that I think is important for me to resolve
*  or for you to resolve.
*  So I'm going to ask this,
*  people that sleep nine hours or more,
*  perhaps that reflecting an issue,
*  some underlying issue perhaps,
*  is being a teenager or an adolescent
*  and undergoing a stage of development
*  where there's a lot of bodily and brain growth
*  an exception to that?
*  Because I don't recall sleeping a ton
*  when I was a teenager.
*  I had a ton of energy,
*  but I know a few teenagers and they sleep a lot.
*  Like they'll just sleep and sleep and sleep and sleep.
*  Should we let them sleep and sleep and sleep?
*  Let them sleep.
*  Okay, so that's the one exception.
*  What about us? Just like babies.
*  Okay.
*  When you're developing something in your brain
*  or the rest of your body,
*  you really need sleep to help organize that.
*  I mean, sleep is doing really hard work
*  in organizing our brains
*  and making it develop right.
*  And if we deprive ourselves of sleep,
*  we will actually also just like I said,
*  we have a daily clock.
*  We also have a developmental clock
*  and we can miss a developmental window
*  if we don't let ourselves sleep extra like we need to.
*  What other things inhibit growth hormone release
*  or other components of this first stage of sleep?
*  In other words, if I go to sleep religiously
*  every night at 10 PM,
*  are there things that I perhaps do
*  in the preceding hours or the preceding day,
*  like ingest caffeine or alcohol
*  that can make that first stage of sleep less effective,
*  even if I'm going to sleep at the same time?
*  Alcohol definitely will do that
*  because alcohol is a REM sleep suppressant
*  and it even suppresses some of that stage two transition
*  to REM with those sleep spindles.
*  And those sleep spindles,
*  we didn't talk about their function yet,
*  but they're really important for moving memories
*  to our cortex.
*  It's a unique time when our hippocampus,
*  sort of like the RAM of our brains,
*  writes it to a hard disk, which is the cortex.
*  It's a unique time when they're connected.
*  So if you don't want to miss that,
*  you don't want to miss REM sleep
*  when it's also a part of the consolidation process
*  and schema changing process.
*  Before we go to sleep, we'll do that.
*  Until we've metabolized alcohol
*  and put it out of our bodies,
*  it will affect our sleep badly.
*  Probably fair to say no ingestion of alcohol
*  within the four to six hours proceeding sleep,
*  given the half life.
*  Or at all would be better,
*  but I know some people refuse to go that way.
*  Maybe a little bit is okay.
*  I don't know what the dose response is,
*  but there are studies out there you can look at.
*  Great.
*  So we're still in the first stage of sleep
*  and I apologize for slowing us down,
*  but it sounds like it's an incredibly important
*  first phase of sleep.
*  What about the second and third 90 minute blocks of sleep?
*  Is there anything that makes those unique?
*  What is their signature,
*  besides the fact that they come second and third
*  in the night?
*  There's more and more REM sleep the later the night we get.
*  There's also a change in hormones.
*  The growth hormone and melatonin levels
*  are starting to decline, but other hormones are picking up.
*  So it is a really different stage
*  that you also don't want to shortchange yourself on.
*  And I think that's the stage.
*  Many studies are showing that those are the times in sleep
*  when the most creativity can happen.
*  That's when our dreams can incorporate and put together
*  old and new things together into a new way.
*  And our schema are built during that time.
*  So yeah, we can change our minds best
*  during those phases of sleep.
*  Could you elaborate a little bit more on schema?
*  I don't think anyone on this podcast
*  has ever discussed schema.
*  I'm a little bit familiar with schema
*  from my courses on psychology, but it's been a while.
*  So maybe you could just refresh mine
*  and everyone else's memory.
*  It's still a concept.
*  Sure, but how do you define schema?
*  I think of schema as,
*  like we have a schema of Christmas, right?
*  We have all kinds of ideas that we sew together
*  and call Christmas a holiday season
*  in the Northern hemisphere.
*  It's cold.
*  We have Santa Claus and reindeer and jingle bells
*  and even things that are false,
*  but we normally associate with Christmas presents,
*  family gathering, when it is.
*  All of this stuff is sewn together into one.
*  There's a thread linking them all.
*  And we can just give ourselves a list of words
*  and none of them contain the word Christmas
*  and then ask people later,
*  give them another list of words
*  and include the word Christmas
*  and they'll say, oh yeah, that word was there
*  because in their minds, they brought up that word Christmas
*  because it's part of that whole schema.
*  So that's what it's sort of a related,
*  a lot of related concepts, I guess.
*  Can I think about, so like on the desktop of my computer
*  would scare some people, but it's just a ton of folders.
*  But each of the folder names means something
*  very clear and specific to me.
*  And inside of those folders are collections of things
*  that make sense in terms of how they're batched.
*  Is that one way to think about it?
*  Exactly, no, that's a great way to think of it.
*  And when you're in REM sleep in the later parts of the night
*  and that transition to REM,
*  that's when your computer of your brain
*  is opening folders and comparing documents,
*  seeing if there, is there anything the same?
*  These two documents look very much the same,
*  but there's a little bit of difference
*  and it can link those conceptually
*  so that that's probably one of the origins of creativity
*  is finding things that are related,
*  maybe just linked a little bit
*  and you can find that link and strengthen it
*  if it makes your schema interesting and different.
*  Very interesting.
*  Many people, including myself,
*  tend to wake up maybe once during the middle of the night
*  to use the restroom.
*  I've tried to drink less fluid before going to sleep.
*  I've heard also that the impulse to urinate,
*  forgive the topic, but a lot of people deal with this.
*  So the impulse to urinate is also dictated
*  by how quickly you drink fluid, not just the total volume.
*  So I've switched to sipping fluids more slowly
*  for my last beverage of the day, which seems to help.
*  But the point here is that I think a lot of people wake up
*  once in the middle of the night,
*  oftentimes to use the restroom,
*  but oftentimes just around 3 a.m.
*  and might be up for a few minutes,
*  hopefully not on their phone or viewing any bright light,
*  which can cause more wakefulness,
*  but then go back to sleep.
*  Is there any known detriment
*  to this middle of the night waking?
*  Or should we consider it a normal feature
*  for some people's sleep architecture?
*  Yeah, I think we shouldn't worry about it, actually.
*  I think sleep is really incredibly
*  well homeostatically regulated.
*  And so really don't worry about how much you're sleeping,
*  as long as you're not intentionally depriving yourself
*  of sleep by doing something really rewarding and exciting,
*  because even that is stressful to your body
*  and deprives you of a lot of things we're talking about.
*  So don't worry about it.
*  It's absolutely normal to wake up
*  at least once in the middle of the night
*  to go to the bathroom.
*  And as long as you can get back to sleep
*  in a reasonable amount of time,
*  or even if it takes you an hour,
*  don't worry about it as long as you have a lifestyle
*  that allows you to then make up that sleep,
*  either the next morning or the next night,
*  or going to bed a little earlier.
*  So if I understand correctly,
*  there's a little bit of asymmetry to sleep,
*  that catching that first phase of sleep,
*  it's like you either get it or you don't,
*  and you have to get it by going to sleep,
*  essentially the same time each night,
*  maybe plus or minus 15 minutes or so.
*  But then if I wake up in the middle of the night
*  and go back to sleep, I can not catch up,
*  but I can gather all the sleep that I would have gotten
*  had I just slept the whole way through the night.
*  Is that right?
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  And we don't know actually the answer
*  to whether or not the sleep in the middle
*  between that early sleep and the late sleep
*  is in fact different for another reason,
*  and whether depriving yourself of sleep
*  from say one to 2.30 in the morning
*  is bad in a different way.
*  We don't know.
*  Well, I suppose I am the experiment in that case,
*  because I do tend to wake up once per night
*  and I've sort of come to recognize it
*  as part of my normal sleep architecture.
*  I don't obsess over it.
*  I do notice that when I go back to sleep,
*  and especially toward morning,
*  that my sleep is incredibly deep.
*  My dreams are incredibly vivid.
*  I don't always remember them,
*  but what is unique perhaps about the architecture
*  of dreams and sleep in the,
*  let's say the last third of the night,
*  or the second half of the night.
*  Right, yeah, in the second half of the night,
*  we have longer REM sleep periods,
*  and those are considered the deepest sleep,
*  even though slow wave sleep,
*  big slow wave is considered deep.
*  It is deep.
*  Yeah, they call slow wave sleep deep sleep
*  and REM sleep rapid, I mean,
*  but now you're telling me that REM sleep
*  is actually the deepest sleep.
*  Okay, there needs to be a new nomenclature
*  for sleep researchers.
*  I know, you really shouldn't call it deep or not.
*  No, no, please.
*  The reason why you call slow wave sleep deep sleep
*  is because it's difficult to arouse people
*  out of that state,
*  and when you do arouse them out of that state,
*  they're most often confused
*  and just want to go back into sleep
*  and can go back pretty easily.
*  If you arouse someone out of REM sleep,
*  they're more likely to report something
*  that was really kind of almost like wakefulness.
*  It was so vivid, but in fact,
*  if you give someone a non-threatening kind of stimulation,
*  like somebody dropping keys or a ping
*  or something like that,
*  instead of waking, that same volume
*  will wake someone up out of non-REM sleep,
*  but out of REM sleep,
*  it instead lengthen the amount of time
*  or make it even more dense,
*  your rapid eye movements more dense,
*  and often people will incorporate that sound
*  into their dreams.
*  So the body and brain are somehow conscious of the sound,
*  and I've heard also smells can even make it into our dreams
*  in REM sleep, but it doesn't arouse us from sleep.
*  It doesn't arouse us as often, yeah.
*  And maybe one of the reasons why REM sleep is deeper,
*  especially in adults and older people,
*  that deep slow wave sleep goes away.
*  So it's not as deep, it's not as big,
*  the slow waves aren't as large,
*  which is probably problematic, but we're not sure.
*  So then REM sleep becomes the deepest stage.
*  Actually in children, it's kind of a toss-up
*  because it's really hard to wake them up
*  out of that deep slow wave sleep,
*  and in fact, fire alarms don't wake them up,
*  even really loud fire alarms out of that state of sleep.
*  So that's why they're trying to change fire alarms
*  so that instead of something
*  that the kids don't associate with anything,
*  like the, whatever they don't associate with,
*  it says their name or something else
*  that may be less loud but more salient to them,
*  and will wake them up.
*  I don't know, having carried sleeping children
*  in from the car, I don't know that I want children
*  to start waking up from sleep,
*  because that's one of the best things
*  when you get home and the kids are asleep in the backseat,
*  you can literally throw them over your shoulder,
*  gently of course, and put them to sleep,
*  and they are completely out.
*  Yeah, it's wonderful.
*  It is wonderful.
*  One of nature's gifts.
*  I'd like to take a quick break
*  and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.
*  Athletic Greens, now called AG1,
*  is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
*  that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.
*  I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,
*  so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
*  The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
*  and the reason I still take Athletic Greens once
*  or usually twice a day is that it gets to be,
*  the probiotics that I need for gut health,
*  our gut is very important.
*  It's populated by gut microbiota
*  that communicate with the brain, the immune system,
*  and basically all the biological systems of our body
*  to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.
*  And those probiotics in Athletic Greens
*  are optimal and vital for microbiotic health.
*  In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number of adaptogens,
*  vitamins, and minerals that make sure
*  that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met.
*  And it tastes great.
*  If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
*  you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman,
*  and they'll give you five free travel packs
*  that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens
*  while you're on the road, in the car, on the plane, etc.
*  And they'll give you a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
*  Again, that's athleticgreens.com slash Huberman
*  to get the five free travel packs
*  and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.
*  So this enhanced volume or proportion
*  of rapid eye movement sleep in the second half of the night
*  relates to more elaborate dreams.
*  We are paralyzed during REM sleep, correct?
*  Yes, normally you're paralyzed, and that's really good
*  because that's the time when we're actively dreaming
*  storyline dreams and we could hurt ourselves.
*  We're actually really cut off from the outside world
*  in terms of responding to, say, this table or window or door.
*  And so different from sleepwalking,
*  which is out of slow-wave sleep,
*  and out of slow-wave sleep, that sleepwalking
*  is a mixture between sleep and wakefulness.
*  So you actually will respond to the door.
*  You can cook a full meal, drive your car
*  while you're in deep, slow-wave sleep.
*  It's scary because you never know what you're going to do.
*  You don't have voluntary control over it.
*  You have no conscious control over it,
*  but you can actually safely navigate some situations
*  in sleepwalking and actually have a conversation,
*  although it may not make much sense when you're sleep talking.
*  In REM sleep, you're not processing the outside world.
*  And instead, when you're acting out your dreams,
*  you could be doing things like walking
*  through a plate glass window or falling off of, you know,
*  down the stairs, things like that.
*  So you really want your muscles
*  to be inactivated during REM sleep.
*  Otherwise you will act out those dreams
*  and really hurt yourself or your bed partner.
*  What about sleep talking or talking in sleep?
*  I don't know how many relationships have been saved
*  by sleep talking, but I'm guessing a few
*  have been destroyed.
*  And I'm guessing that talking in sleep could have meaning
*  or perhaps has no meaning just as dreams
*  could have meaning or no meaning as we recall them.
*  Yeah, do not take sleep talking seriously.
*  No matter what people say,
*  it doesn't necessarily reflect truth.
*  So it's not like you're being more truthful
*  when you're sleep talking.
*  You just saved a number of relationships.
*  I hope so.
*  I'm not directing this at anyone in particular,
*  but I guarantee you just did.
*  Noted.
*  So as people start to approach morning
*  or the time when they normally would wake up,
*  I've heard that it's important to, if possible,
*  complete one of these 90-minute cycles prior to waking up.
*  That is, if you set your alarm for halfway
*  through one of these 90-minute cycles
*  that come late in the night of sleep,
*  that it can lead to rather groggy patterns of waking.
*  So I'll just ask you directly, do you use an alarm clock?
*  I do not.
*  Thankfully, I'm in a line of work
*  that doesn't require me normally
*  to do anything at any particular time.
*  I do it when I do it, unless I have to catch a plane
*  and then I always set my alarm, just in case.
*  Well, as a fellow academic, I can tell you
*  there are plenty of punishing features
*  about being an academic scientist
*  that offset the fact that you don't have to use an alarm clock,
*  but it is nice that you can often set your own schedule.
*  So would you recommend that, if possible,
*  that people not use an alarm clock?
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  If you can just listen to your body
*  and wake up when you need to wake up, that would be great.
*  But one of the reasons why we have such a grogginess,
*  it's called sleep inertia,
*  when we wake up out of the wrong state,
*  which is deep, slow-wave sleep,
*  is because I liken it to like a washing machine cycle.
*  This 90-minute cycle is like a washing machine cycle.
*  And the first part is to add water, right?
*  And then your clothes are soaking wet.
*  You don't want to open the washing machine
*  and try and function, put them on and wear them around
*  while they're soaking wet and full of soap.
*  So you have to wait until the cycle is through before you can...
*  Well, actually, let's put it in the dryer, too,
*  before you want to wear them.
*  So, yeah, you can function.
*  It just takes a little while for those clothes,
*  that brain to dry out so you can actually function well.
*  But it's better to wait through the whole cycle is complete.
*  And so that's why you want to set that 90-minute alarm clock.
*  And again, that's around 90 minutes
*  because the first stage of sleep,
*  the first cycle of sleep is actually a little longer,
*  more like 105, 110 minutes,
*  but then the second ones and third ones,
*  they get sort of shorter and shorter as the night goes on.
*  And in the last few cycles,
*  you're just doing the N2 REM sleep cycle,
*  which takes less time.
*  And if you wake up out of REM sleep,
*  there's usually no problem cognitively.
*  You're good to go.
*  Are you a fan of sleep trackers?
*  Sure, yeah.
*  Do you use one?
*  I have one on.
*  I don't take...
*  I don't live my life by them
*  because they are...
*  The best ones right now are about 70% effective at staging your sleep.
*  So 70%, it's okay.
*  It's okay, but take it with a grain of salt is what I'm saying.
*  Yeah, I've tried various ones
*  and I compare the mattress-based one to...
*  I actually wear it on my ankle instead of my wrist.
*  And I do find it informative,
*  but a colleague of mine at Stanford, Ali Crum,
*  who works on mindset and belief effects,
*  talked to me about a study they did
*  where people often will bias their sense of daytime wakefulness
*  based on their sleep score
*  more than their subjective score.
*  In other words, if they were told they got a poor night's sleep,
*  even if they got a great night's sleep,
*  and this was of course measured in the sleep lab,
*  so they were able to compare,
*  people report feeling more groggy,
*  and the opposite is also true,
*  that if it says 100% or 90% on your sleep score,
*  then people go, oh, I feel great,
*  even though they might not have slept well.
*  So this speaks to the, I don't want to say placebo effect,
*  but the sort of belief effects that are woven in with a score.
*  Yeah, that's right.
*  So it seems to me that combining subjective and objective data
*  is probably best.
*  And I do believe that you should trust your own physiology,
*  and the way that your body is telling you to feel,
*  because in fact, it used to be that people with insomnia
*  were often not believed,
*  because you'd put them in a sleep lab,
*  and they looked like they slept great,
*  and you wake them up in the morning,
*  they say, oh, I didn't sleep very well at all.
*  And that's because probably we just came out with a paper
*  that shows that subcortical structures
*  can be in a completely different sleep state
*  than cortical structures,
*  which is what we measure in the sleep lab,
*  what the cortex is doing.
*  So it might be that people who say,
*  I did not sleep all night long,
*  even though the cortex is saying,
*  oh no, you had great sleep,
*  was because they're monitoring their subcortical,
*  hypothalamus, hippocampus, thalamus,
*  other structures that the sleep lab just can't access
*  unless you have depth electrodes,
*  which nobody really wants.
*  Right, because that requires holes in the skull,
*  and wires. Holes in the skull, yeah.
*  Wow, so does that mean that the last 50 plus years
*  of sleep science is potentially flawed in some way
*  because they're only recording from,
*  I guess this would be the analogy would be,
*  it's like recording from the surface of the ocean,
*  as opposed to the depth of the ocean.
*  Right, and trying to ascertain the life moving down deep
*  in the depth of the ocean.
*  Brace yourselves, colleagues at Stanford Sleep Lab
*  and elsewhere, but please just tell us,
*  because I think scientists want to know the truth.
*  Yeah, I mean, it's not for nothing
*  that you want to know what the cortex is doing.
*  I mean, the cortex is really important for a lot of things,
*  but it doesn't necessarily tell you
*  what a lot of other really important parts of the brain
*  are doing in terms of sleep.
*  But there's hope, because in fact, it would be great.
*  I think that's possible from the paper,
*  if you look at it, it's in PNAS this year,
*  that you could detect subtle changes in the cortical EEG
*  that might be able to tell you
*  what the subcortical structures are doing.
*  Things like the absolute power in that sleep spindle band,
*  that sigma band, would change if the hippocampus
*  is in REM sleep and cortex is in that sleep spindle state
*  and vice versa.
*  So there is some hope that we can gain
*  from people with depth electrodes,
*  or animals with depth electrodes,
*  that we could backwards machine learn
*  what the cortex might be able to tell us
*  about subcortical structures from the cortical EEG.
*  Interesting, this is going to be a stimulus
*  to stay tuned, as it's going to be a stimulus
*  for development of new technology,
*  which is always going to assist in scientific discovery.
*  One more thing I wanted to ask about
*  the architecture of the night's sleep
*  in terms of early part of the night.
*  Earlier you mentioned the washout of debris
*  and the so-called glymphatic system,
*  I think is what you're referring to.
*  Could you tell us a little bit more about the washout
*  that occurs in the brain during sleep?
*  What that is and what roles it's thought to serve?
*  And perhaps if there are any ways to ensure that it happens
*  or to ensure that it doesn't happen,
*  and obviously we want this to happen.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  All right, great question.
*  We talked about the circadian clock
*  and how certain things happen at certain times.
*  Well, one of the things that happens when we're awake
*  and talking to each other is that
*  there's a lot of plasticity.
*  There's something that I'm learning from you today
*  and you're learning from me,
*  and that changes our synapses
*  and it changes the way our proteins are going to be folded
*  and changed during sleep.
*  It unfolds, this process actually uses a lot of ATP,
*  the power structure, the fuel of the brain,
*  and it unfolds also proteins while we're doing this,
*  while we're using them.
*  And so during that first part of the night,
*  when we first fall asleep, in the first 20 minutes or so,
*  we're building that adenosine back into ATP,
*  and that's probably why power naps are called power naps,
*  because we're actually rebuilding the power.
*  And then we're also cleaning out
*  through the deep slow waves of sleep,
*  we're cleaning out all those misfolded proteins,
*  unfolded proteins, and other things that get broken down
*  and need to be rebuilt when we're asleep
*  because of its use during wakefulness.
*  So I liken that to having a big party during wakefulness
*  and you need all those party-goers to leave
*  in order to do the cleanup.
*  And so what I think the mechanism is,
*  and this is still something to be tested,
*  is actually slow waves themselves,
*  which is bad news for us as we get older
*  and those slow waves get smaller,
*  and slow wave sleep goes away.
*  So what happens when a neuron is firing is that it expands,
*  the membrane expands a little bit,
*  it becomes more translucent, that's how we know,
*  one of the ways we know that neurons expand when they fire.
*  And so every action potential,
*  the membrane expands a little bit
*  as sodium brings water into their cell.
*  And then when they're silent, they contract,
*  and so during slow waves, the cool thing is that
*  the reason why you can measure them
*  is that all the neurons at the same time,
*  not all of them, but a good portion of them,
*  are firing at the same time and silent at the same time.
*  And so you think about that as contracting
*  and expanding all at the same time,
*  it's kind of like a bilge pump of the brain,
*  so that can pump out.
*  Glia are also really important for this
*  in terms of cleaning up debris and transferring it
*  to where it needs to go.
*  So I think of it actually as a bilge pump,
*  cleaning out our brain.
*  Interesting, I've heard about the glymphatic system
*  and the lymphatic washout,
*  I've never thought about the mechanical aspects
*  of it before.
*  I always thought that for some reason,
*  that now it's obvious to me
*  there had to be something mechanical,
*  but only now that you've educated me about this.
*  I thought that for some reason,
*  the cerebral spinal fluid just starts washing through,
*  but here you're talking about literally an expansion
*  and a contraction of the neurons in unison
*  and pushing the fluid through,
*  cleaning out any misfolded proteins or debris
*  that might occur on the basis of these metabolic pathways.
*  And the consequence of that is to what?
*  To leave the brain in a state of more pristine action
*  for the next day, is that right?
*  Yeah, you think of it again like a party
*  and if you don't clean up after that party,
*  you try and hold another one the next day,
*  it's gonna get more clogged.
*  People have a harder time moving around
*  and enjoying themselves,
*  and if that builds up day after day,
*  it's gonna be cognition,
*  that would be the party goers moving around,
*  becomes hard.
*  And so this build pump that you describe
*  is associated with the big slow waves of deep,
*  well, of slow wave sleep.
*  So this is gonna occur more or less
*  in the first third of the night, is that right?
*  And are there things that inhibit this process
*  and are there things that facilitate this process?
*  Yeah, so well, one thing to inhibit is not to get it.
*  Right, and here too, sorry to interrupt,
*  but and is this similar to the case with growth hormone
*  where if you go to sleep later than you would normally,
*  you miss the washout.
*  It's not you don't delay it, you miss the washout.
*  That's right, so if you go to sleep
*  at one or two in the morning,
*  your sleep is still gonna be dominated by N2 and REM sleep,
*  not by slow wave sleep.
*  So you need to get that first bit of sleep.
*  Would a caveat to that be if somebody normally goes to sleep
*  at one or two a.m. and wakes up at 10 a.m.?
*  Yeah.
*  If that's their normal sleep cycle.
*  Yeah, that should be okay, it should be okay.
*  You would probably wanna do,
*  somebody would wanna do a sleep study
*  with people who do that normally
*  and see if also the melatonin release is later
*  and the corticosterone rise
*  that happens normally in the morning also happens later.
*  So if everything shifted, good.
*  Okay, yeah, there are a few studies I've come across
*  that really do argue for the fact
*  that waking up circa sunrise,
*  that doesn't mean at sunrise, but within an hour or two,
*  maybe three hours of sunrise and going to sleep
*  within four hours after sunset or so
*  is actually better for the health of all human beings
*  than is being a night owl.
*  And the night owl,
*  there's almost like a night owl posse out there,
*  especially on social media, they get very upset
*  when you say that you should see morning sunlight,
*  that after 10 a.m. you kind of miss the boat.
*  They get very upset because I think there are
*  about 20 or 30% of people perhaps
*  who really feel like they function better staying up late
*  and waking up late and they function much less well
*  waking up early and going to bed early.
*  But the data on health metrics suggests
*  that sorry night owls, that they are wrong.
*  Yeah, sorry me, because I'm a night owl.
*  Oh boy, okay, well then I'm apologizing directly.
*  And here I'm not a really early morning person.
*  I'm kind of more typical if I wake up naturally
*  around 6.30, somewhere between 6.30 and 7.30 a.m.
*  go to sleep somewhere between 10 and 11 p.m.
*  These are averages.
*  But I do notice that when I force myself
*  to get up a little earlier and go to sleep a little earlier
*  that my mood and alertness and just overall productivity
*  is much higher and there could be other variables.
*  Yeah, you're absolutely right.
*  I'm a night owl.
*  I love staying up late at night, doing writing grants,
*  writing papers, watching movies, whatever it is.
*  I love it.
*  But I like you and like every human being on earth
*  do better if I go to bed earlier
*  and wake up earlier.
*  So one good thing for night owls is to have a child
*  because they will wake you up.
*  Their circadian rhythms are so strong.
*  They will wake up and even if you deprive them of sleep
*  in the first half of the night,
*  they will still wake up like clockwork
*  because their circadian rhythms are so strong at 6 a.m.
*  And so what you've, you haven't done anything good
*  for your kid, you haven't moved their cycle to later
*  and be more in line with yours.
*  In fact, you've just sleep deprived them
*  and made them miss a window and made them cranky
*  the next day and made your life more miserable.
*  So go to bed soon after your kids go to bed
*  and wake up with them.
*  That's the way to do it.
*  Great, the child alarm clock, another reason to have children.
*  I got a dog, a puppy, and then that became a dog
*  specifically, well, for many reasons.
*  But one reason was I wanted to be one of those early morning
*  Raj, you know, 5.30 a.m. every morning.
*  But I ended up getting a bulldog
*  that would literally sleep 16 hours if he could.
*  A nuclear bomb could go off and he wouldn't wake up.
*  But what I started to learn was that bulldogs
*  actually have sleep apnea.
*  As far as I know, they're the only species
*  that has a genetically, they're essentially
*  an inbred sleep defect.
*  And so I actually don't encourage people to get bulldogs
*  because it's kind of a cruel breed.
*  They suffer a lot in that body that they're born into.
*  Anyway, a dog can accomplish some of this,
*  but get the breed of dog that is going to wake up early.
*  So in other words, don't get a bulldog or a mastiff.
*  Well, you know, interestingly, all predatory animals
*  like dogs and cats and lions and us,
*  well, more dogs, cats and lions than us
*  can sleep 16 hours a day.
*  Ferrets are predatory.
*  They can sleep.
*  I had a pet ferret.
*  Yeah.
*  And sadly, I also used to work on ferrets,
*  published a number of papers.
*  Delightful animals.
*  Yeah, and great because you can study development.
*  It's really cool because they're born very altricial
*  like we are with brains that are not very well developed.
*  And so you can see what happens through development
*  and how important these different phases
*  of development really are.
*  But yes, yeah, maybe we're not as much predators
*  as we think because in fact, our sleep is somewhere
*  between the prey and the predators
*  in terms of the amount of sleep that we usually need a night.
*  But those predators can sleep 16 hours napping all day long
*  and they're more corpuscular perhaps like their prey are.
*  So dawn and dusk active.
*  Yeah, dawn and dusk active.
*  Yeah, but anyway, yes, children and dogs.
*  Actually, there was a poll done
*  by the National Sleep Foundation to see
*  what the number one thing is that wakes people up at night.
*  And number two is going to the bathroom.
*  Number three is children because when your children
*  are young, but that only lasts a few years
*  and they'll wake you up when they're babies.
*  But the number one thing is pets
*  and pets needing to go out or cats wanting to curl up
*  with you or whatever it is, pets needs will wake you up more
*  in the middle of the night than anything else.
*  Another reason to not get a nocturnal pet.
*  People who get hamsters pretty quickly realize
*  that they are nocturnal and they want to run
*  on their wheel around.
*  Yeah, you got to put them in the living room away
*  from where you sleep.
*  I vote fish tank folks, freshwater fish tank.
*  There are all sorts of reasons to not get a saltwater tank.
*  Freshwater fish tank or a child.
*  I appreciate that vote.
*  And I appreciate you mentioning ferrets.
*  And by the way, folks, they are carnivores.
*  They are not rodents and they have
*  very elaborate brain structures.
*  They're very smart in the same family
*  as the honey badgers and the other mustelids.
*  Anyway, I shouldn't geek out too much on the mustelids
*  or else I'll take the remainder of all our time.
*  I'd love for you to tell us about REM sleep
*  and the sleep later in the night
*  as it relates to dreams and emotionality.
*  And this is probably the appropriate time
*  for you to introduce us to this incredible structure
*  in the brain, which is the locus coeruleus.
*  A difficult structure to spell,
*  but a beautifully named structure.
*  I find locus coeruleus to be just fascinating.
*  And I know a small fraction of what it does
*  and I'm hoping you're going to educate me
*  and our audience about more about what it does
*  and hopefully tell us a little bit about its relationship
*  to epinephrine, AKA adrenaline.
*  Yeah, I am so glad you brought this up
*  because I can totally geek out on the locus coeruleus.
*  Please do.
*  Locus meaning spot or place and coeruleus meaning blue.
*  So you could just call it the blue spot.
*  That's the easiest.
*  Every animal with a brain has a blue spot.
*  And I mean every animal with a brain
*  because of course there are animals with nervous systems
*  that are not centralized like jellyfish.
*  But anyway, we're digressing there.
*  So the locus coeruleus is filled with neurons
*  that have in them norepinephrine,
*  which is the brain's version of epinephrine or adrenaline.
*  It's also called noradrenaline.
*  And what it does is it,
*  just like adrenaline in the rest of our bodies,
*  it helps prime us to respond to our environment.
*  So when locus coeruleus neurons fire and fire in a burst,
*  we can switch our attention.
*  And they will fire in a burst if, for example,
*  a loud noise happens in the middle
*  of your concentrating on something.
*  So it helps, it fires,
*  and it helps you switch your attention to that thing
*  and then learn quickly from it.
*  So it's really important in a stress response.
*  It helps us do quick one trial learning.
*  And then tonic activity during the day
*  or when you're just going about your normal concentration
*  kind of activities is really good for sustained attention.
*  It works with the cholinergic system of our basal forebrain,
*  which is really important for learning and memory also
*  to help us learn about things and put things together.
*  But just tonic levels are signature of wakefulness
*  and alertness.
*  So too much is panic with a locus coeruleus activity.
*  A burst is switching attention,
*  and then tonic levels are sustained constant attention.
*  And then when we go to sleep,
*  the locus coeruleus slows and goes from about on average,
*  two hertz to about one hertz, one cycle per second tonically.
*  And then when we go into REM sleep,
*  it's the only time when it shuts off completely.
*  And it appears that that complete silence
*  is really, really important for a number of things.
*  And the main thing that I think it's important for
*  is the ability to erase and break down synapses
*  that are no longer working for us.
*  So they encode things that are false now,
*  or they are encoding things that we learned
*  in the novelty encoding pathway of our brain
*  that have now been consolidated to other pathways.
*  And so we need to now erase them
*  from the novelty encoding pathway.
*  And that is really, really important
*  for being able to continue to learn things all of our lives.
*  So like erasing that REM or that,
*  I don't know what you call those disks
*  that you stick into computers.
*  That'll hard drive.
*  I don't know.
*  Thumb drives.
*  Thumb drives.
*  You're erasing your thumb drives.
*  That thumb drive is what you carry around all day long.
*  And then during sleep,
*  you write that thumb drive to the cortex,
*  to the long-term memory structures,
*  and you need to refresh that thumb drive.
*  And that's what happens during REM sleep
*  when the locus serulis is off.
*  Because whenever it's on and neuroadrenaline is there,
*  it helps us to put things together.
*  It helps us to learn and strengthen synapses,
*  but it does not allow us to actually weaken synapses
*  that are also a really important part
*  for life, important part of lifelong learning.
*  Yeah.
*  So much more I could say about that.
*  Yeah.
*  Locus serulis sounds fascinating.
*  So it's connected to the basal forebrain cholinergic system.
*  The neurons in locus serulis, if I'm not mistaken,
*  release norepinephrine, perhaps epinephrine as well?
*  Well, no, the brain's version of epinephrine
*  is norepinephrine.
*  The other thing it also,
*  the precursor to norepinephrine is dopamine.
*  And so the source of dopamine in the hippocampus
*  seems to be the locus serulis,
*  and it's still a mystery as under what conditions
*  the locus serulis also releases dopamine,
*  but it's really important when we're learning something new
*  to also release dopamine or to at least activate
*  the dopaminergic receptors in our hippocampus.
*  So yeah, so dopamine, norepinephrine,
*  and then there's also galanin,
*  which is important for releasing when we're stressed,
*  and it helps also without rapid learning.
*  It works in concert with norepinephrine
*  in doing what it needs to do to strengthen synapses
*  so that we learn really quickly.
*  I love that there are multiple molecules involved
*  because that signals us to a principle,
*  which is that even if people can't remember all the names,
*  that rarely in biology is something handled
*  by just one molecular pathway,
*  that redundancy is the rule,
*  because signaling attention to specific events
*  is so important.
*  So I'm gonna use that as a just so story.
*  I always say, I wasn't consulted at the design phase,
*  but it makes sense to me as to why redundancy
*  would exist in this system.
*  Absolutely, and in fact,
*  when we form hypotheses about the brain,
*  we're always wrong,
*  and the reason why we're always wrong
*  is because it's more complicated than we like to think,
*  and because in our brains when we're forming hypotheses,
*  we fail to account for all of the factors that are involved,
*  the glia, the neuropeptides, the neurotransmitters,
*  the physical structure of synapses,
*  and so when I was going through grad school 35 years ago,
*  the dogma was that every neuron contains
*  one neurotransmitter and releases one neurotransmitter,
*  and you had excitatory neurotransmitters
*  and inhibitory neurotransmitters
*  and neuromodulatory neurotransmitters,
*  but that's as complicated as God,
*  and then we started talking about neuropeptides,
*  and people said, oh no, please don't complicate it,
*  and then we started talking about how neurons
*  contain both neuropeptides and neurotransmitters,
*  and maybe more than one neurotransmitter.
*  And maybe even hormones too.
*  And hormones, and oh Lord, it's just so complicated,
*  but I gotta admit that's why it works, right?
*  And every time the brain teaches us something new
*  about itself that we didn't hypothesize,
*  we say, oh of course, that wouldn't work
*  if the way I hypothesized it with it,
*  we actually need redundancy,
*  we need all these systems to work together.
*  It's daunting sometimes,
*  but it also ensures many careers in science,
*  and neuroscience in particular,
*  so note that aspiring scientists,
*  there's plenty of room for discovery.
*  Do you want me to talk about norepinephrine
*  and emotion and stress?
*  What I'd love for you to tell us about is
*  what role this lack of norepinephrine release
*  during rapid eye movement sleep is thought to achieve,
*  and maybe you could also review some of your work
*  describing conditions under which norepinephrine invades
*  Yeah, invades sleep.
*  Rapid eye movement sleep and other patterns of sleep,
*  and how that can be detrimental.
*  Yeah, so a lot of this is hypothetical,
*  but based on a lot of good evidence
*  that we're sewing together into a schema
*  from which these hypotheses come,
*  so a model schema from which these hypotheses come,
*  but one thing that happens to people
*  with post-traumatic stress disorder
*  is that there is a lot of evidence
*  that the locus surrealis doesn't stop firing in REM sleep.
*  So whereas their levels of norepinephrine
*  might be similar to people without PTSD during the day,
*  and even during the first part of the night,
*  during the wee hours of the morning,
*  and when you measure norepinephrine levels
*  from metabolites in the blood or the cerebral spinal fluid,
*  you see that people with PTSD,
*  it's during the wee hours of the morning
*  when you have the most REM sleep that they have,
*  their norepinephrine levels differentiate most
*  from those that don't have PTSD.
*  And so that's evidence that the locus surrealis
*  is not shutting down during REM sleep like it should.
*  Other evidence is heart rate variability.
*  When our locus surrealis is firing,
*  our heart rates are generally a little higher,
*  and they don't vary as much as they do
*  when the locus surrealis is not firing.
*  So during slow-wave sleep,
*  normally have this big juicy variability in heart rate
*  with every breath in and breath out,
*  because our norepinephrine levels,
*  our norepinephrine levels are lower.
*  During REM sleep, it goes away entirely,
*  and our heart rate is dominated by parasympathetic
*  rather than sympathetic activity,
*  and also what our brain is driving,
*  what are we dreaming about.
*  For example, if we're dreaming we're running,
*  our heart rates will go up.
*  But norepinephrine levels still should be low or off.
*  So people with PTSD that noradinergics,
*  we're studying these in rats too,
*  is it true that our locus surrealis doesn't shut off
*  when we have post-traumatic stress disorder,
*  and the preliminary evidence is yes,
*  it's true that it doesn't shut off.
*  So what that would do is norepinephrine
*  would act at synapses to prevent that weakening
*  that you really need, for example,
*  of novelty encoding structures.
*  And it keeps memories in that novelty encoding structure
*  even once it's consolidated to the rest of the brain.
*  So in the hippocampus, which is important
*  for remembering things throughout our lives,
*  and it's that thumb drive,
*  we need it to be erased so that we can learn new things
*  once it's been consolidated to the hard drive of our cortex.
*  And so if we're not able to do that,
*  we fill up that RAM really quickly,
*  or that thumb drive really quickly,
*  and we're not able to learn new things.
*  So for example, after a trauma,
*  I talked about the locus surrealis
*  responding in stressful situations.
*  That's great, it's very adaptive.
*  But then you need it to stop.
*  Once you've learned what you need to learn from it
*  and you wanna go to sleep,
*  you need the locus surrealis to calm down.
*  And during REM sleep, you want it to stop
*  because then when you've consolidated
*  that traumatic memory to the cortex,
*  you need to erase it from the novelty encoding structures,
*  for example, in the hippocampus,
*  so that then when you're in the context of safety,
*  you can learn those new things, those new contexts,
*  and stop responding to those same stimuli
*  as though you're in that original situation.
*  So if you're not able to erase that thumb drive,
*  you will always feel like that trauma happened
*  that same day, like earlier that same day,
*  and respond as you would to an early, a recent trauma,
*  which is with beating heart and all of that.
*  So even memories that are years past,
*  if you're never able to downscale that novelty
*  encoding structure and you purge it
*  from that traumatic memory,
*  it will stay fresh and new and then become maladaptive.
*  I'd like to just take a brief moment
*  and thank one of our podcast sponsors,
*  which is InsideTracker.
*  InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
*  that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
*  to help you better understand your body
*  and help you reach your health goals.
*  I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
*  for the simple reason that blood work is the only way
*  that you can monitor the markers, such as hormone markers,
*  lipids, metabolic factors, et cetera,
*  that impact your immediate and long-term health.
*  One major challenge with blood work, however,
*  is that most of the time,
*  it does not come back with any information about what to do
*  in order to move the values for hormones,
*  metabolic factors, lipids, et cetera,
*  into the ranges that you want.
*  With InsideTracker, changing those values
*  becomes very straightforward
*  because it has a personalized dashboard that you can use
*  to address the nutrition-based, behavior-based,
*  supplement-based approaches that you can use
*  in order to move those values into the ranges
*  that are optimal for you, your vitality,
*  and your longevity.
*  InsideTracker now includes a measurement
*  of apolipoprotein B, so-called APO-B,
*  in their ultimate plan.
*  APO-B is a key marker of cardiovascular health
*  and therefore there's extreme value
*  to knowing your APO-B levels.
*  If you'd like to try InsideTracker,
*  you can go to insidetracker.com slash Huberman

*  Again, that's insidetracker.com slash Huberman
*  to get 20% off.
*  What approaches are you aware of
*  that can turn down the output of locus coeruleus
*  during these phases of sleep?
*  And for that matter, what things can cause ramping up
*  of locus coeruleus during this phase of sleep?
*  We've had a couple podcast episodes, solo episodes,
*  and with guests talking about trauma.
*  We had Dr. Paul Conti, who's a Stanford-trained,
*  Harvard-trained psychiatrist who talked a lot about trauma,
*  wrote an excellent book on trauma.
*  And certainly sleep was emphasized as a key thing,
*  like get enough sleep.
*  But here you're saying even if somebody with trauma
*  gets enough sleep, if locus coeruleus is hyperactive
*  during sleep, those traumas are gonna persist.
*  And most of the trauma treatments that I'm aware of
*  everything ranging from cognitive behavioral therapy,
*  talk therapy, drug therapy, EMDR, hypnosis.
*  Nowadays there's a lot of interest and attention
*  on clinical studies on exploring psychedelics,
*  high dose psilocybin and MDMA.
*  So it's a vast landscape, none of which, as far as I know,
*  is really focused on sleep specifically.
*  No, they're not.
*  And they should be because actually psychedelics
*  is a sleep-like state.
*  And it's a REM sleep-like state.
*  Although, of course, there are some major differences.
*  So yeah, so much to talk about here.
*  So antidepressants are often noradinergic
*  or serotonergic reuptake inhibitors.
*  So they leave norepinephrine actually
*  out there in the synapses.
*  And what that does is it inhibits REM sleep.
*  And if you're able to get REM sleep,
*  it would probably be REM sleep
*  with some noradinergic activity.
*  So actually, I think anyway, I'm not a physician,
*  that antidepressants are counter-indicated.
*  You don't want to take them if you've experienced a trauma
*  and you're experiencing PTSD,
*  because if anything, it's going to make it worse
*  or at least prevent the type of adaptive REM sleep
*  that you really need in order to resolve
*  those emotions and move on.
*  Is that statement specific to antidepressants
*  that tickle the noradinergic pathway?
*  So the one that comes to mind is brupriorone,
*  can never pronounce it, brupriorone,
*  which is what I think brand name is well butrin.
*  It's a dopaminergic and noradinergic agonist.
*  That's the net effect as opposed to the prozaxol loft variety,
*  which are SSRIs.
*  Yes, yes, but SSRIs themselves also are problematic
*  because we didn't talk about it yet,
*  but the dorsal raphe nucleus, which produces serotonin,
*  which the specific serotonin reuptake inhibitors block
*  from being reuptaken, leaves too much serotonin out there.
*  And what serotonin also is another neurotransmitter
*  that's downregulated during REM sleep,
*  that's specifically off during REM sleep.
*  And what serotonin does is it weights all of our cognition
*  to being able to recognize novelty again.
*  So it sort of weights our brain away
*  from a sense of familiarity and toward novelty.
*  And it might be one reason why it's an effective
*  antidepressant because it makes the world
*  feel fresh and new again, right?
*  But when you have too much,
*  you're holding a novel traumatic memory
*  in your novelty encoding structure too strongly already,
*  you don't want to again weight things toward novelty.
*  You need that absence of serotonin also
*  to help you get that sense of familiarity
*  and to start erasing the novelty encoding structures.
*  So you need both to be absent.
*  It's really interesting.
*  We hear a lot about serotonin and it's not often discussed
*  in terms of its features related to novelty enough, I think.
*  And what you just described,
*  excuse me to something that Dr. Paul Conti and others
*  have said in terms of trauma, and here I'm paraphrasing.
*  So my apologies to them for not getting this exactly right.
*  That an effective treatment for trauma
*  does not erase the traumatic memory,
*  but it causes a transition of what once was disturbing
*  and invasive and maladaptive to eventually just become
*  kind of a boring old story that has kind of a fuzzy texture
*  to it as opposed to this kind of sharp,
*  high friction texture that invades our thinking.
*  And obviously our sleeping states as well.
*  So again, and I appreciate the disclaimer,
*  the caveats around not being a clinician, et cetera,
*  but I do think that there's a lot of interest now
*  in whether or not antidepressants
*  are effective for trauma or not.
*  I think these aspects of neuromodulation
*  as they relate to, let's call it erasing traumas
*  or changing the emotional load of traumas during sleep
*  is something important to take note.
*  We also have a lot of clinicians
*  that listen to this podcast, so they should also take note.
*  So if I want to reduce the amount of norepinephrine
*  released from locus coeruleus during rapid eye movement sleep
*  to eliminate the troubling or maybe even traumatic memories
*  and allow late stages of sleep each night
*  to have their maximum positive effect,
*  is there anything that I can do besides avoiding traumas,
*  avoiding serotonergic or noradrenergic compounds?
*  Well, I would also avoid anything just prior to going to sleep
*  that might excite those systems.
*  So a lot of novelty, a lot of exciting,
*  stress-inducing video games.
*  Try and enter sleep with as much calm as you can.
*  So maybe deep breathing exercises.
*  That's a beautiful way to calm your sympathetic
*  fight or flight system, this deep breathing.
*  And we haven't been able to test this with rats
*  because we can't ask them to do a deep breathing exercise.
*  There might be a way we can do that,
*  but I haven't found out or figured it out yet.
*  But if there's a way you can make your sympathetic system,
*  nervous system calm down before you go to sleep,
*  might free for you meditation or deep breathing exercises.
*  It might be for some, a warm bath or a comforting book.
*  Nothing too exciting, but also nothing too boring, perhaps.
*  Just something right in the middle,
*  which makes you feel happy and calm is what you should do.
*  And if you instead go to sleep while you're anxious
*  or you're hyped up, then your sleep could become maladaptive.
*  Another thing that happens in rats
*  that we have yet to know if it happens in women
*  is that female rats have three phases of their estrus cycle
*  that their locus rillus doesn't seem to calm down
*  during REM sleep as much.
*  And we don't know why, but during the high estrogen phases
*  of their estrus cycle, the locus rillus shuts down
*  just like it does in male rats.
*  But in the other three phases, it doesn't.
*  So one thing that might work,
*  and in fact, there are a few studies that show it,
*  it could work really well,
*  is giving women after a trauma event
*  something that contains estrogen,
*  because estrogen somehow is protective against PTSD.
*  And they know that through retrospective studies
*  where they gave women in emergency room
*  either a pill with estrogen or without,
*  and those that had the pill with estrogen in it
*  were much less likely to get PTSD from that trauma
*  as measured a year later
*  than those that had the pill without.
*  So there's really good studies by Bronwyn Graham.
*  She's out of Australia to really hone in
*  on how much estrogen do you need,
*  and also testosterone, just so you know,
*  gets converted to estrogen in the brain.
*  So testosterone also can be protective
*  because it gets converted to estrogen.
*  But there's something about estrogen
*  that's really helpful and protective
*  from the high locus rillus firing.
*  And this is again preliminary data
*  that we don't have all the answers yet,
*  and we are looking into it actively right now,
*  but it's really important.
*  The other thing about women is that we are
*  two to four times more susceptible
*  to anxiety-related mental health disorders,
*  including post-traumatic stress disorder.
*  So if we could figure out what's happening
*  to the locus rillus during sleep in women,
*  and then figure out a way to normalize that
*  so the locus rillus is silent
*  and it needs to be silent,
*  I think we could go a long way
*  in helping women be more resilient
*  to stress-related disorders.
*  What are some other sex differences
*  as they relate to sleep?
*  Yeah, yeah, that's a really good question.
*  There have been very few studies, unfortunately,
*  of women in sleep, women in estrus cycle
*  or menstrual cycle in sleep.
*  And, but what we have found,
*  which actually largely replicated the study in 1960,
*  is that women or females rather,
*  at high estrogen, high hormonal phases
*  of their estrus cycle or menstrual cycle,
*  sleep a lot less, but that sleep is more efficient.
*  So that sleep is more dense in those sleep spindles,
*  which I haven't gone into what they might do,
*  except this connection between the hippocampus and cortex,
*  but those sleep spindles are more dense and more coherent
*  across the brain areas.
*  The theta cycle, which is five to 10 hertz
*  in the hippocampus, important for one-year learning
*  and also important during REM sleep,
*  is also bigger and juicier during the high hormonal phases.
*  So even though there's less sleep,
*  it's more efficient and better.
*  But, so all of that efficiency seems to be reduced
*  in those other hormonal phases.
*  So even though you might sleep a little more,
*  you might need more sleep, in fact,
*  in order to accomplish the same thing
*  that you can get with that short,
*  very efficient sleep of high hormonal phases.
*  Very interesting.
*  I think there is a growing trend,
*  at least among NIH-funded grants,
*  to require that, as they refer to it in the grants,
*  biological sex as a variable.
*  And here we're talking about sex, the verb,
*  although I'm sure there's studies about that too,
*  but biological sex is a variable
*  because there is a dearth of studies
*  exploring sex differences in most everything.
*  There are all sorts of reasons for that,
*  but more importantly, fortunately the trend is shifting.
*  And even when you study males versus females,
*  a lot of people just include females in their studies,
*  but then don't track the estrus cycle or menstrual cycle.
*  And hormones have huge effects on our behavior.
*  I mean, just think of it when you said sex.
*  Before our hormones come in, we're not interested in it.
*  And suddenly, that's kind of a main driver of behavior
*  is hormones can definitely change who we are and what we do.
*  So we should be studying hormones, not just sex.
*  I always say that puberty
*  is perhaps the most massive transformation
*  and rate of aging that any of us go through
*  in a short amount of time.
*  An individual, their cognition changes,
*  their worldview changes,
*  and that's largely hormonal driven
*  and obviously neural architectures change too.
*  I'm very happy that you mentioned
*  I'm trying to get into calmer states prior to sleep
*  and some ways to do that.
*  I'm a big fan and I've talked a lot before on this podcast
*  about things like yoga nidra,
*  which is a non-movement based practice,
*  sometimes called non-sleep deep rest,
*  where people actually take some time each day
*  to practice how to go into a more parasympathetic,
*  aka relaxed state deliberately,
*  because it's a bit of a skill.
*  Yeah, and there's some good data really,
*  mostly out of a laboratory in Scandinavia
*  showing huge increases in nigrostriatal dopamine
*  when people go, basically engage in a practice
*  of deliberate non-movement
*  and that the brain actually enters states
*  of a very shallow sleep.
*  So sort of nap-ish,
*  but the idea is to actually stay awake but motionless
*  and it does seem to restore a certain number of features
*  of neurochemistry, but perhaps more importantly,
*  it teaches people to relax,
*  which is something that most people are not very good at.
*  But in any event, and people who listen to this podcast
*  have heard me say this over and over again,
*  so I sound like a broken record,
*  but this practice as a zero cost practice
*  that doesn't require any pharmacology
*  does seem to really enhance people's ability
*  to fall asleep more quickly
*  and to fall back asleep if they wake up
*  in the middle of the night.
*  So in any event, another plug for NSDR, yoga nidra.
*  Well, I just also want to add to that.
*  That's one of the reasons why insomnia is so insidious
*  is because when people feel like
*  they haven't gotten enough sleep
*  and they're not getting enough sleep
*  and they become anxious about getting enough sleep
*  and then you're anxious before going to sleep,
*  like I'm not going to fall asleep,
*  it's going to be 45 minutes in
*  and then that's a positive feedback loop.
*  So you need to break that loop, say,
*  okay, my body's going to get as much sleep as it needs,
*  I needn't worry about it.
*  And then practice this relaxation to say,
*  hey, it's all okay, it's going to be all right.
*  And then concentrate on things that relax you,
*  whether it's concentrating or not concentrating,
*  whatever it is.
*  You mentioned yoga nidra
*  and that reminded me of transcendental meditation,
*  which is something that also hasn't been studied well,
*  or largely because we can't ask non-human animals to do it.
*  And so we don't know what's happening
*  with our neurochemistry and our brain activity
*  in a deep and meaningful way.
*  But one thing that has been shown
*  and those that can do it really well
*  is that that theta activity that I said happens
*  when you're learning something or when you're in REM sleep,
*  it's well established and increases
*  during the transcendental meditation.
*  So it might be that some states of meditation
*  could in some ways replace or mimic some functions
*  of, for example, REM sleep.
*  But again, we don't know if all the neurochemistry is right
*  to do, for example, the thing that I was talking about,
*  which is erasing the novelty
*  and coding structures of the brain.
*  That needs an absence of norepinephrine and serotonin,
*  which we don't know if that goes away
*  with transcendental meditation,
*  we just don't know the answer to that yet.
*  Yeah, the studies on yoga nidra and sleep replacement
*  are kind of interesting.
*  It does seem to be the case
*  that nothing can really replace sleep except sleep,
*  but that if one is sleep deprived
*  or is having trouble falling back asleep,
*  that these things like, and I hear it's,
*  I acknowledge this is essentially like yoga nidra,
*  but we now call it non-sleep deep breast or NSDR,
*  because oftentimes for names like yoga nidra
*  act as a kind of a barrier for what would otherwise be
*  people willing to try a practice.
*  It sounds mystical. Medication and yoga.
*  It sounds like flying carpets and,
*  it sounds like you have to go to Esalen,
*  by the way, Esalen's a beautiful place,
*  but it sounds like you have to go there
*  or live in the West Coast to believe in this stuff,
*  but it's simply not the case.
*  These are practices that are really just
*  self-directed relaxation as a practice
*  that allows people to get better and better
*  at directing their brain states towards more relaxation.
*  And most people have an asymmetry,
*  like for instance, most people can force themselves
*  to stay up later, but they have a hard time
*  going to sleep earlier.
*  And that just speaks to the asymmetry
*  that's probably adaptive and survival based
*  that we can ramp ourselves up far more easily
*  than we can tend to calm ourselves down.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  And actually, to appeal to other Christians like me,
*  prayer can be a wonderful way to calm yourself down
*  because through prayer, you're giving your cares to God
*  and saying, and then you are relaxed,
*  and I just want to say that because the same reason
*  that yoga might put some people off,
*  it might put some people off to talk about prayer,
*  but it's the same process of being able to relax.
*  And get outside our own experience a little bit.
*  Get outside our experience, yeah.
*  Back out, get a worldview that might actually
*  also help us to relax.
*  Well, you might be surprised at how many clinicians
*  and scientists who've come on this podcast
*  have mentioned things like prayer from various perspectives,
*  Christianity, Judaism, Muslim traditions, and others,
*  that as a parallel to all of these things.
*  And I think what it speaks to is the fact
*  that ultimately the biological architectures
*  that we're all contending with are going to be identical.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  And so different ways to tap into them
*  and ones that are congruent with people's beliefs
*  I think are great.
*  Yeah, because anything non-congruent with your beliefs
*  is also stressful.
*  And feels forced, and that's why this idea
*  of calling it non-sleep deep rest in addition to yoga nidra
*  was not to detract from the naming
*  or the history around yoga nidra,
*  but I was finding that it was a barrier.
*  Likewise, yoga nidra tends to include things like intentions
*  whereas NSDR scripts, and by the way,
*  we will provide links to some NSDR and yoga nidra scripts,
*  but NSDR has no intentions.
*  It's simply body scan deep relaxation based.
*  So it's sort of the scientific version of all of this stuff,
*  and actually we study it in the laboratory
*  and some of the brain states that people go into,
*  but that's a discussion for another time.
*  This is hard not to.
*  My mother used to tell me when I said,
*  why don't we could play, I can't go to sleep.
*  She'd say, well, start with your toes and relax.
*  So you would clench your muscles around your toes
*  and relax them and do that all the way from your toes
*  all the way to your head.
*  And I don't know where she got this.
*  It might've been her own common sense
*  or she might've gotten it from this NPR show
*  it's called The Mind Can Keep You Well.
*  She used to listen to,
*  but that's another intentional relaxation
*  that focuses on the body
*  rather than on your own mental processes.
*  I do a little bit of work with the military
*  and there's a method within certain communities
*  of special operations in the US military
*  where if they can't sleep
*  or they're having challenges sleeping,
*  they will deliberately try and relax
*  their facial muscles in particular,
*  like sort of drape the facial muscles
*  and use long or exhale emphasized breathing
*  does seem to increase the probability
*  of transitioning back into sleep.
*  And those are hallmarks of yoga nidra,
*  non-sleep deep rest, body scans.
*  And so I think all of these things converge
*  on a common theme.
*  As neurobiologists, we can say
*  all of the things that we are describing
*  certainly move the needle away
*  from locus coeruleus activation.
*  I mean, we haven't done the experiment
*  to really look at that,
*  but it seems all these things are counter
*  to noradrenaline release.
*  Right, another one is yawning.
*  Yawning in itself is that kind of sort of tensing
*  of all the muscles in your face and then relaxing them.
*  So it might be why we yawn.
*  We don't know why we yawn yet,
*  but it might also be really great.
*  Actually animals yawn too.
*  My bulldog was a perpetual,
*  if he wasn't sleeping, he was yawning.
*  And it would be interesting to see what yawning does
*  to the locus coeruleus.
*  Does that also come and switch locus coeruleus activity?
*  Because it's interesting that facial nerve,
*  like trigeminal nerve through the vagus
*  connects indirectly to the locus coeruleus
*  and has a powerful effect on that.
*  Interesting.
*  A common, I think, friend of ours
*  and direct colleague of yours,
*  Jack Feldman was a guest on this podcast
*  telling us about all the amazing structures
*  he and others have discovered
*  in respiration and breathing.
*  Sounds like we have a collaboration brewing
*  that the three of us should definitely carry out.
*  I'd love for you to share with us
*  a little bit more about the spindles
*  that have come up a few times.
*  And I don't know if it's relevant to this,
*  so if it's not, let's separate it out.
*  But I'd love for you to tell us a little bit
*  about the role of sleep in problem solving and creativity.
*  And if spindles are involved,
*  and I'll consider myself lucky
*  for batching them in the same question,
*  and if they're not involved,
*  simply feel free to separate them out.
*  I think they could be involved.
*  And the reason why I think they could be involved,
*  because we now know a lot more about spindles.
*  First of all, the first thing that we knew
*  was that they were sleeping.
*  First of all, we ignored them.
*  Then we thought they had something to do
*  with keeping us asleep, and that was their function.
*  It was when an external stimulus came,
*  they would keep us asleep because they would arise.
*  But now we know that the density of our sleep spindles,
*  the number that we produce per minute
*  is well correlated with our intelligence in the first place,
*  and that no matter what your intelligence is,
*  and no matter what your sleep spindle density is,
*  if you learn something during the day
*  and increase your sleep spindle density,
*  it's really almost perfectly correlated
*  with our ability to consolidate that information
*  and incorporate it into the schema
*  that we already have in our brain.
*  So if you try and learn something new,
*  even if your sleep spindle density at baseline is great,
*  if you don't increase your sleep spindles that night,
*  you're not gonna use sleep to really incorporate it.
*  Interestingly, sleep spindles are poor
*  in those with schizophrenia.
*  It's one of the characteristic signatures of sleep
*  is that sleep spindles are very few and far between,
*  which might mean that people with schizophrenia
*  might not be able to incorporate new information
*  into already existing schema,
*  and instead it sort of flaps in the breeze out there
*  and can be accessed erroneously at times
*  when you don't want it to be involved.
*  So I digress.
*  So sleep spindles and creativity.
*  So one of the things we now know
*  through some great studies by Julie Seep and Anita Luthi
*  is that sleep spindles are accompanied
*  by an incredible plasticity out in the distal dendrites,
*  the listening branches of our neurons
*  that listen to other cortical areas.
*  So there are proximal dendrites in our neurons
*  that listen to the external world
*  and are conducted through the thalamus,
*  and then there are distal dendrites,
*  which listen to an internal kind of conversation
*  that's happening in our brains.
*  It's kind of our internal state, really.
*  And during sleep spindles,
*  that's when those distal dendrites are able to best learn
*  from other cortical areas and from the hippocampus.
*  It is during sleep spindles that the hippocampus
*  and the cortex are best connected
*  and when that incredible plasticity can happen.
*  When I talk about schema,
*  that's a cortical, cortical thing.
*  That's when the image of Santa Claus and presence
*  comes together.
*  It's not through some external thing.
*  Once we learn those things together,
*  it's our cortex that encodes that
*  and brings those images back up together.
*  And that's during sleep spindles, when that's happening.
*  When there's big surges of calcium
*  into those distal dendrites
*  and where plasticity happens in just huge amounts.
*  During that sleep spindle stage of sleep,
*  which is N2 stage,
*  there's also another excitatory event
*  that comes all the way from the brainstem
*  and projects everywhere in our cortex,
*  which is called P-geowaves.
*  P for pons, G for geniculate nucleus of the thalamus,
*  which is where they're first discovered.
*  And O for occipital area, which is our visual area,
*  which is again where they're first discovered.
*  But in fact, it's now been shown that P-geowaves,
*  which we should generalize to P-waves
*  because they come from the pons and go to the thalamus
*  and then the cortex happens all over the brains.
*  And that is where glutamate,
*  which is a major excitatory neurotransmitter
*  involved in learning and plasticity
*  is being released in big amounts
*  also in those distal dendrites.
*  So P-waves and spindles work together to cause plasticity
*  and so our schema together,
*  which could be the origins for insight and creativity.
*  Now, when P-geowaves or P-waves are first discovered,
*  it was thought to be random
*  because this small area that generates P-waves
*  all over the brain,
*  projects all over the thalamus
*  and causes P-waves all over.
*  And you don't measure P-waves all over the brain
*  at the same time.
*  In fact, it just seems sporadic and random.
*  So that's probably, and P-waves are also happening
*  even more during REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep.
*  So that's why people think that REM dreams are so random
*  is because these P-waves are random
*  and they could generate dreams
*  because they're an internal source of excitation
*  that kind of replaces the outside world
*  during our dream state.
*  And so these P-waves, if they are random,
*  could function, could be the underlying reason
*  why REM sleep dreams are random.
*  And it might also be why creativity can happen there
*  is because we're randomly activating,
*  co-activating different things in our brain
*  that we can then sew together.
*  But it might not be as random as we think.
*  So that's a caveat there.
*  I just learned a lot from you
*  because I teach brainstem to medical students
*  and I talk about the pons.
*  And the pons is like this dense collection
*  of all these different nuclei involved
*  in a bunch of different things.
*  And it's close by a bunch of interesting things.
*  And it's still kind of a mysterious brain area.
*  But when I learned about P-g-o waves,
*  I thought pons, geniculate, occipital,
*  because occipital is most commonly associated
*  with the visual cortex.
*  I thought it was the origin
*  of the visual component of dreams.
*  It probably is.
*  I'm very happy to learn that they should be called P-waves
*  because they include lots of different areas of the brain.
*  And it makes really good sense to me
*  why the kind of pseudo randomness of dreams,
*  especially these late night and early morning,
*  later in sleep, I should say,
*  and early morning dreams seem to be cobbled together
*  from kind of disparate experiences.
*  You walk through a door and suddenly
*  it's a completely different context and landscape.
*  Yes, beautiful.
*  Yeah, I like this idea a lot.
*  It makes intuitive sense, it makes biological sense.
*  It also gives me something to talk about
*  to the medical students next quarter
*  when I talk about pons.
*  And you wanna talk about where in the pons?
*  It's right below the locus serulis.
*  It's called the subserulis.
*  They're glutamatergic.
*  It's also called S-L-D, sub lateral dorsal nucleus.
*  Love it.
*  So note to any aspiring neurobiologist,
*  there's a vast landscape of yet to be undiscovered
*  structure and functions in the pons.
*  You wanna work on something
*  that is sure to reveal something novel,
*  work on the pons.
*  Because it's in every textbook,
*  it's a clinically very important structure.
*  Sadly, gliomas and other cancers of the brain
*  can often surface in the pons.
*  But we still know very little about it.
*  I read a paper this last year,
*  and I think it was covered in a bit of popular press,
*  that during rapid eye movement sleep,
*  people can solve problems or respond to external stimuli.
*  For instance, they would give them math problems.
*  They'd whisper in their ear while they were in REM sleep,
*  what's two plus two?
*  And people would say, even though they were paralyzed,
*  apparently they could still move their mouth
*  because they'd say four or something like that.
*  Or they'd say, what's your name?
*  And people could respond.
*  And so that in REM sleep, perhaps people,
*  some elements of cognition are still active.
*  I'm glad you brought that up.
*  What do you think?
*  And I don't know the authors of that study.
*  And listen, if ever I say something wrong,
*  it's great on this podcast,
*  because someone will tell us in the YouTube comments.
*  It's one of the great uses of YouTube comments.
*  But I'd love to know your thoughts on that study.
*  I mean, is that just kind of an odd feature?
*  Or does this have meaning?
*  Should we actually care about this result?
*  There's no just about it.
*  It's really actually intriguing and interesting
*  and might relate to this paper that I talked about
*  where we said different areas of the brain
*  can be in different states at the same time.
*  So lucid dreaming is another thing
*  we can't ask animals to do
*  or can't ask them if they've done it.
*  But we can certainly ask humans to do it.
*  And some people can do it really well.
*  And it would be really interesting to see
*  in those people who could lucid dream really well,
*  whether they spend more or less time
*  in this asymmetrical state
*  where one area of the brain is in one state
*  and another area of the brain is in another.
*  And it might be that those people can respond
*  to questions during REM sleep best
*  are those that have the most asymmetry
*  or dissimilarity or dissociation
*  between subcortical and cortical structures.
*  Or it might be that they're the ones with the most symmetry.
*  We don't know.
*  I do worry a little bit about lucid dreaming
*  because it's a fad.
*  People are really excited about it.
*  And to be able to remember one's dreams is fun,
*  often unless they're nightmares.
*  But it's really interesting.
*  Or to be able to direct one's dreams
*  if they are nightmares is really wonderful power to have.
*  To be able to redirect a nightmare
*  that has been repeated to something else
*  and then kick yourself out of that
*  repetitive nightmare is really nice.
*  But I worry a little bit about because we know so little
*  about what's actually going on in the brain.
*  And if this lucid dreaming state is preventing us from,
*  for example, from the locus realis from calming down
*  or the serotonergic system from silencing like it should.
*  And maybe what we're doing during this state is,
*  yeah, we're activating the learning and memory structures,
*  but in a way that's maladaptive
*  in terms of the erasure that we need to do.
*  So maybe one of the reasons why most people don't remember
*  most of their dreams is for good reason.
*  Your hippocampus is in a state
*  where it's not writing new memories.
*  In fact, it's writing out the memories it learned
*  during the day to the cortex
*  and it's immune from incoming new information.
*  So maybe lucid dreaming is bad
*  because you're activating the hippocampus
*  in a way that's writing new memories
*  and it might be really maladaptive for things like PTSD.
*  On the other hand, let me just argue myself right out of this.
*  When I used to have a repeated nightmare,
*  when I was a kid, my mother, who was so wise,
*  would tell me, well, listen,
*  just next time you're in that dream,
*  say, hey, I'm in a dream and then change something about it.
*  So she and I rehearsed what the horrible dream that it was.
*  It was a big monster running after me
*  and my legs were like mud and I couldn't run away
*  and it was just terrifying.
*  And that was a dream I would have time and time again.
*  She said, okay, next time, what are you gonna do?
*  And that monster comes after you.
*  I'm gonna run away.
*  And she said, no, that's what you do every time
*  and it's always the same outcome.
*  You can't run.
*  So let's do something different.
*  Like, what could you do that's different?
*  So I came up with, oh, I could turn around
*  and punch it in the nose.
*  Yeah, that's great.
*  So the next time I had that dream, I did recognize
*  this is that same old dream,
*  which means that there's part of my brain
*  that's conscious enough to know
*  that I'm in a dreaming state.
*  And then I didn't have the courage in my dream
*  because I was still terrified to punch
*  or touch the monster in any way,
*  but I did have the courage to turn around
*  and look it in the eye and say, no, that was enough.
*  I said, no.
*  And that was enough to knock me out of that rut
*  of that dream so that I never had it again.
*  I never had that same dream again.
*  And in fact, it gave me peace about dreaming
*  because I knew that if ever there was a nightmare
*  that was just too scary, I could probably do something
*  to change it and knock myself out of it.
*  So even though I don't recommend lucid dreaming
*  on a normal day-to-day basis,
*  if it's enough that can knock you out of a rut,
*  one thing that happens with people with PTSD
*  is they have the same repeated horrible nightmare,
*  which is often a reliving of the day's trauma that they had.
*  So maybe lucid dreaming can be used on occasion
*  to be a powerful tool because there's so much plasticity
*  that happens during REM sleep to knock you out of that rut
*  of reliving that event and just change it.
*  And you could probably practice that during wakefulness,
*  rehearse the event that happened that was so traumatic,
*  and then just introduce a new element like,
*  now I'm safe.
*  Now the sound that was associated
*  with that really traumatic thing,
*  I should now associate with something else.
*  And next time I have that dream, I'm gonna change it
*  so that sound is now this new thing
*  that it should be associated with safety.
*  And that might be enough, maybe, I hope,
*  to knock you out of that repeated nightmare
*  and maybe even start you on the path to recovery
*  because if you can calm down
*  about those nightmare states of sleep,
*  then maybe your locus aureolus,
*  which is involved in stress, can also relax
*  and you can do the erasure parts that need to be done.
*  I love it.
*  I seem to recall a paper,
*  and I'll have to find the reference and send it to you.
*  We will also put it in the show note captions,
*  that described a protocol that essentially matches this idea.
*  And I think what they had people do
*  is either cue themselves to a particular smell
*  or tone and wakefulness,
*  then to try and recall a recurring nightmare.
*  Then during the night's sleep,
*  they have the tone playing in the background,
*  which would then cue them to the wakeful state.
*  They're still asleep, mind you,
*  but in the pseudo lucid or lucid state,
*  and then try and change some variable,
*  as you're describing.
*  Either look the predator in the eyes
*  or do something different.
*  And then in the waking state,
*  take a little bit of time to try and script out
*  a different narrative altogether.
*  And it took several nights, as I recall, or more,
*  but that they were able to escape this recurring nightmare.
*  It was like a week or something.
*  So you're familiar with the study.
*  Yeah, it was a beautiful study.
*  I loved it.
*  Yeah, we will put a reference to that.
*  I need to revisit that study.
*  It was pretty recent,
*  but I need to dive into it again,
*  because I think I didn't go as deep into it as I should have.
*  No, no, but the one thing that you said,
*  many right things, but one of the things you said
*  is that they were able to cue the dreamer
*  when they knew they were going to REM sleep,
*  and then they played the sound or had the odor.
*  Now, when you're normally asleep alone in your bed,
*  you're not gonna be able to cue yourself,
*  but it might be that rehearsal enough
*  before you go to sleep is enough to help cue you
*  to that repeated nightmare.
*  Remembering what the nightmare is,
*  and then figuring out how to cue yourself
*  to do something different.
*  For years, I had the same recurring nightmare
*  over and over and over again,
*  and it was so salient and so clear,
*  and I'm not gonna share what it is,
*  because it's not that it's that disturbing.
*  It was just, I think it was the emotional load of it,
*  and just how salient certain features were.
*  Like one person who was a real life person
*  had a particular clothing on,
*  and that just served as this cue.
*  And I don't know if I ever did any direct work
*  to try and deal with it,
*  but now it almost seems silly to describe it.
*  Oh yeah, well dreams are usually silly to describe.
*  Yeah, it was pretty silly.
*  But your emotional system.
*  It was a pretty violent dream.
*  Yeah, and your emotional system is so geared up
*  during REM sleep, which is another thing
*  we could talk about.
*  Yeah, please.
*  I would love to, yeah, so locus coeruleus
*  is ideally suppressed, so we can't release norepinephrine.
*  We can't act out our dreams.
*  This, during these very emotionally laden thoughts
*  and storylines during sleep,
*  this almost starts to sound like a little bit of
*  a built-in while sleeping trauma therapy.
*  Because most trauma therapy is involved
*  trying to get people into states of
*  counter to what most people think,
*  you actually want to get close to the trauma
*  in terms of the narrative,
*  but try and suppress the emotional activity of it.
*  Or, I guess that's the motivation
*  for ketamine-based therapies for trauma.
*  Or, I've also heard, and this is still perplexing to me,
*  that other waking-based trauma therapies
*  involve taking people the other way,
*  making it very cathartic.
*  Take them to the peak of the emotional response,
*  but then allow that to finally cycle down
*  into a more relaxed response.
*  So, please, if there's anything about locus coeruleus
*  and dreams that can help people basically extinguish traumas
*  or traumatic features to real-life events,
*  we definitely want to know about them.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Well, I think one of the things that people thought
*  might help after a trauma, like a school shooting
*  or whatever car accident is to talk about it.
*  But, in fact, that ended up being counterproductive.
*  And I think one of the reasons why it was counterproductive
*  is because it didn't take them back down.
*  It brought them up and continued to
*  reactivate the emotions of it,
*  but then didn't emphasize the safety effect
*  that it's over or help them work through
*  how they might avoid it again in the future
*  to calm the sympathetic nervous system down again
*  before they went to sleep.
*  And none of these studies has sleep ever been considered.
*  But, to me, that's the key part,
*  is bringing down your sympathetic nervous system
*  before you go to sleep so that your sleep can be adaptive,
*  your locus coeruleus can shut off
*  like it normally does or should do,
*  and then able to erase the novelty of it.
*  The other thing that I just mentioned a minute ago
*  was that the emotional system is highly activated
*  in REM sleep, and that's definitely true.
*  And that might seem counterproductive
*  in terms of the nightmares and how to help REM sleep
*  be a therapeutic thing rather than reinforcing
*  the emotionality of the trauma.
*  And I think the key to that, again,
*  is the absence of norepinephrine.
*  So even though the emotional system is in high gear,
*  without norepinephrine, you can actually
*  divorce those highly activated emotions
*  from the cognitive parts of the memory
*  that you have just written out in that N2 stage of sleep
*  when the sleep spindles are going.
*  So you've just now consolidated the information
*  that you'll need to survive and to make that adaptive,
*  and now you need to divorce from that schema
*  and from that semantic parts of memory the emotional part,
*  because whenever you remember something,
*  it's fine if you remember being emotional at the time,
*  but you don't wanna bring back and sew into that memory
*  all of the same emotional systems.
*  You don't wanna bring back the heart rate changes
*  and the sweating and all of that.
*  You wanna be able to remember all the parts of it
*  and even remember that you were traumatized
*  and that you did cry and that you did have,
*  your heart was racing, but when you're talking about it,
*  years later, you don't wanna have to relive all that,
*  otherwise who would ever want to recall a traumatic memory?
*  Because you're basically putting yourself
*  through the same trauma, which is what people with PTSD have.
*  They don't want to recall this traumatic memory
*  because it's reliving it, like it's just happening again.
*  So that's what we're thinking is that the emotional parts
*  are not able to be divorced
*  because the norepinephrine system
*  is not downscaled during REM sleep.
*  And so that REM sleep serves to instead reinforce
*  and in fact amplify the emotions
*  because your emotional system is up,
*  locus coeruleus is high,
*  re-sewing in every night the emotionality of those memories
*  and with the memory itself.
*  You've told us a lot about locus coeruleus
*  and norepinephrine from locus coeruleus.
*  Is there any role for norepinephrine,
*  epinephrine and cortisol released from the adrenals?
*  My understanding is that norepinephrine and epinephrine
*  will not cross the blood-brain barrier,
*  which is probably why we have a brain-based
*  noreadrenergic system, locus coeruleus
*  and other neurons present.
*  Actually, that's a question I should ask you.
*  Are there other sites in the brain
*  where norepinephrine is released from
*  or is it just locus coeruleus?
*  So there are seven, nine different adrenergic,
*  yes, there's nine different adrenergic structures.
*  I'm sorry, I didn't ask, but it just occurred to me
*  that in some cases, like with RAFE,
*  there are other sources of serotonergic drive in the brain
*  but RAFE is like the main site.
*  Yeah, that's the one that goes to the cortex
*  and the locus coeruleus is also the one
*  that goes to the cortex.
*  But there are other adrenergic sources,
*  some from the brain stem that descend
*  and help us to ignore pain, for example,
*  when we're stressed and needing to run away from the tiger.
*  We don't wanna be thinking, oh, my ankle hurts.
*  You wanna just be able to ignore it
*  and go do what you need to do.
*  Yeah, so there are lots of other noreadrenergic nuclei
*  but the locus coeruleus is the main one
*  that projects all over the brain.
*  Actually, the only place it doesn't project
*  is the dorsal striatum.
*  You talked about ventral striatum and addiction.
*  The dorsal striatum is the only place
*  the locus coeruleus doesn't project to
*  and that's involved in procedural learning, motor learning,
*  the kinds of learning that take over
*  when your hippocampus, for example, is compromised,
*  bilateral, if you don't have a good hippocampus,
*  you can still do procedural learning and it's great.
*  It's a redundant system.
*  If your locus coeruleus is not working,
*  if you don't have it anymore,
*  if you don't have a good hippocampus,
*  you can still do learning
*  through this dorsal striatum structure.
*  It might be for those kinds of learning functions.
*  Sleep deprivation, where you never let the locus coeruleus
*  stop firing is okay because it doesn't have any receptors
*  for norepinephrine anyway.
*  And what about bodily, like adrenals?
*  Yeah.
*  I often remind people to know such thing
*  as adrenal burnout per se,
*  that adrenals don't actually burn out.
*  But some people have adrenal insufficiency syndrome,
*  other people have adrenals that are just chronically
*  cranking out epinephrine, norepinephrine, and cortisol
*  at the wrong times in particular.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  So those are great questions
*  and I think the answers to them have yet to be discovered.
*  The connections between our periphery
*  and our central nervous system,
*  but we know that there are beautiful connections
*  and it's untapped source of being able to manipulate
*  our brains is to work through our bodies.
*  And so adrenals do great things,
*  they constrict our blood vessels,
*  causing higher blood pressure,
*  which help blood rush out to all the extremities
*  that need blood, our muscles for example,
*  for running away from the lion or the tiger.
*  Or meeting a grant deadline.
*  Or meeting a grant deadline.
*  Or catching a train.
*  Or catching a train, yeah.
*  The adrenals help our hearts bump faster,
*  our muscles get perfused with the blood it needs,
*  it diverts blood and everything away
*  from our parasympathetic system,
*  which is rest and digest.
*  We don't really need to digest that croissant
*  when we're running for a train, we can do that later.
*  So it's doing really important things,
*  what we don't know because it doesn't cross
*  the blood brain barrier is how that affects the brain
*  and whether our, if we can independently activate
*  our adrenals when a time when our brain thinks
*  that we should be fine and calm and asleep,
*  how our brain detects that.
*  Is it a feedback through, our heart is racing
*  and then our brain stem says what's going on,
*  my heart is racing and then wakes us up,
*  and then our hearts were racing together
*  with our brain racing.
*  We just don't know the answers to these questions yet.
*  There are some good studies, old studies,
*  but we need a lot more.
*  All right, well another nod to the fact
*  that there's lots of great work ongoing and still to do.
*  I'd love for you to tell us about some of the work
*  that you're doing more recently on the relationship
*  between sleep and opiate, use, withdrawal, relapse,
*  and craving, just addiction generally.
*  I get a lot of questions about people trying to come off
*  benzodiazepines or people's challenges with benzodiazepine
*  and other types of addiction.
*  Yeah, what is the role of sleep in addiction
*  and recovery from addiction and opiates in particular?
*  Yeah, well this is a very young area,
*  and in fact my laboratory has just started,
*  I have a graduate student who's been in my lab
*  for just one year, she's done amazing work already,
*  but completely groundbreaking work.
*  And what she has discovered already,
*  we don't have the paper out yet,
*  but we're working on it, is that when animals withdraw
*  from opiates, and this has been sort of replicated
*  in other ways with other types of things,
*  our sleep is disturbed, our sleep is terribly disturbed,
*  and the amount of sleep disturbance
*  predicts relapse behaviors.
*  And you might think, well of course you're going to relapse
*  if you can't sleep because opiates calm you down.
*  Well one of the reasons why opiates calm you down
*  is because the locus serulis, again,
*  the loose spot, is covered with opiate receptors
*  that are normally really responsive
*  to our endogenous opiates.
*  And so what happens when we're pleased, for example,
*  or laughing, or whatever, our endogenous opiates
*  activate those receptors in the locus serulis
*  and calm it down.
*  It actually suppresses locus serulis activity,
*  makes us happy and relaxed.
*  One of the reasons why opiates are so addictive
*  is because it also calms us down and makes us relaxed.
*  But the problem with exogenous opiates
*  is that they really strongly bind these receptors
*  on our locus serulis, and if you take
*  exogenous opiates again and again,
*  like you're recovering from surgery, for example,
*  take these pain medications, is that our locus serulis
*  struggles to do what it's supposed to do,
*  which is keep us awake and learning
*  and concentrating on things.
*  So it will down-regulate, it will internalize
*  these receptors that are normally only occupied
*  by endogenous opiates, and it will do this,
*  it will change our genes that are associated
*  with producing these receptors,
*  so you actually have very many fewer receptors.
*  So the locus serulis, at least during wakefulness,
*  can fire and help us to do these things,
*  like learn about our environment.
*  And so if you long-term reduce
*  the number of receptors out there,
*  then when you withdraw the exogenous opiates,
*  there is not enough of your endogenous opiates
*  to be able to occupy those few receptors that are there,
*  and our locus serulis has nothing to calm it down anymore,
*  no pacifier, and it just fires and fires and fires,
*  and that phasic and tonic high activity stresses us out,
*  because it's normally associated with stress.
*  And so any exogenous stressor that adds to that,
*  and it also activates our locus serulis,
*  there's nothing to calm it down again.
*  And so it just keeps firing, it disturbs our sleep,
*  and that's why maybe sleep disturbance is an indicator
*  of hyperactive locus serulis,
*  and such a good predictor of relapsed behaviors,
*  because nobody likes to live in that high stress state,
*  and they will do anything to get back to normal.
*  So the problem with taking these drugs
*  is that it leaves you excited, or sorry, excited,
*  relaxed and happy, but then when you come off of it,
*  you're worse than when you were at baseline.
*  You take it again, it only brings you up this far,
*  because you have fewer receptors.
*  When you come off it, you're down even more depressed
*  and anxious, and depressed is a word I use loosely,
*  and that's not what I should say.
*  Certainly central nervous system depression,
*  I mean, sleepier, less motivated,
*  lowered mood.
*  Yeah, I mean, our locus serulis is actually,
*  it's the anxiety kind of depression,
*  actually the anxiety-related depression.
*  So yeah, so we don't know yet what,
*  and there's some good research going on right now,
*  what could restore our own endogenous receptors
*  so that our own endogenous opiates
*  can properly calm our locus serulis,
*  once that they have been tapped down by exogenous opiates,
*  but that would be really one way
*  that you can access the sleep disturbance.
*  So we talked about sleep and the importance of sleep
*  in terms of learning and memory,
*  the importance of the structure of the 90-minute cycle
*  for all of that.
*  So you can imagine if your sleep is disturbed
*  by too much locus serulis activity,
*  the structure and the function of those sleep spindles
*  and that theta during REM sleep
*  and the lack of norepinephrine,
*  all of those structures, all those functions
*  for learning something new,
*  like a new behavior that as it involves the drugs
*  becomes compromised.
*  And so that's something that Tanya Lugo
*  in collaboration with Pamela Kennedy at UCLA,
*  that we're looking at how is learning and memory affected
*  by the sleep disturbance?
*  If there are ways we can,
*  in animals that are coming off of opiates,
*  can we restore their sleep to normal
*  so that then they are less likely
*  to do relapse kinds of behaviors?
*  Fascinating and I will certainly have to have you back on
*  to tell us the results of those studies.
*  Meanwhile, I think for anyone who's trying to come off opiates,
*  exogenous opiates and restore these systems,
*  what I'm hearing is that it's going to take some time,
*  but that any and all things that people can do
*  to buffer their healthy normal sleep architecture,
*  like morning and daytime sunlight,
*  limiting bright light exposure,
*  lowering the temperature at night.
*  A number of things that we've talked about on this podcast.
*  Calm yourself, deep breathing exercises, meditation,
*  whatever it is that helps you calm yourself before sleep.
*  Right, would facilitate not just sleep,
*  but perhaps even accelerate the recovery
*  and shorten this period of withdrawal,
*  which from the questions I get and from what I hear,
*  can be absolutely brutal.
*  Yeah, I can imagine.
*  I had to take opiates for,
*  I only took it for three days
*  after giving birth to my first son, I think, second son,
*  one of them.
*  And I just said after three days, this is enough.
*  I'm just going to try Tylenol.
*  And so I weaned myself, not weaned,
*  I just did a sudden sharp cutoff.
*  And even though I felt I didn't get the high of opiates
*  when I was taking the Tylenol codeine,
*  when I went off it, boy, it was like PMS times 100.
*  I was so anxious and upset at little things.
*  Thankfully, it only lasted a few hours,
*  but if I had taken it for a week or two weeks,
*  who knows if my endogenous opiate receptors
*  would have been permanently down-regulated
*  and I would have been an addict, you know,
*  an addict, I would have been addicted,
*  I shouldn't say an addict, there's negative connotations.
*  It's just a very physiological state.
*  So no judgments at all associated with it.
*  So yeah, they're powerful, powerful painkillers,
*  but can also alter your entire brain and rewire it.
*  Well, all the more reason why I and many others
*  are grateful that you're doing this work
*  to figure out ways that people can recover
*  more quickly and more thoroughly.
*  I must say you've taught us a tremendous amount
*  in a relatively short amount of time
*  about the architecture of sleep, the different phases,
*  the relationship between sleep and dreaming
*  in this incredible structure, locus aurelius,
*  and I'm so happy we also got into the ponds,
*  that just delights me because we rarely talk about the ponds
*  on this podcast, but it's such an interesting structure.
*  Sex differences that are important in creativity
*  and problem solving and trauma, sleep spindles,
*  just such a wealth of information and much of it
*  that's actionable for people.
*  So first of all, I wanna say thank you
*  for taking the time to sit down and have this conversation
*  that so many people are sure to benefit from.
*  I also wanna thank you for doing the work you do,
*  even though I'm a fellow neurobiologist,
*  I think that it's not often that we take a step back
*  and realize that it's really the work of hard thinking,
*  hard, strongly motivated PIs,
*  stands for principal investigator by the way,
*  PIs like yourself, graduate students and post-docs
*  that really drive the discovery forward
*  and that lead to these new therapeutics.
*  Physicians are wonderful, clinicians are absolutely
*  wonderful, but clinicians don't develop new treatments,
*  they only implement the ones that researchers discover.
*  So thank you for being a brain explorer
*  with a focus on growing the good in the world.
*  I know I speak for everybody when I say thank you so much.
*  Thank you so much, Andrew.
*  Thank you for being an amazing interviewer.
*  You brought a lot out of me in a coherent fashion
*  that normally I can't do when I'm speaking in public.
*  I don't know about that.
*  I've heard your lectures and they're superb.
*  We'll direct people to some of the other ones.
*  Well, thank you.
*  And I also wanna put a plug in for graduate students
*  in general and the key and amazing role
*  that they play in research.
*  I'm a PI, as you said, I used to be a graduate student
*  and a post-doc trainee myself,
*  doing all of this on the ground, hands-on experimentation.
*  It's so hard to do, it's so hard to do right,
*  it's so hard to think through all of that.
*  Now I'm a PI, I get to be an idea person and just say,
*  hey, why don't you do this?
*  And hey, what do you think about that?
*  And they, of course, intellectually contribute so much
*  to these planned experiments,
*  but they also do the really hard work.
*  And so I just wanna say thank you, graduate students,
*  thank you to my graduate students
*  and all graduate students out there, thank you post-docs.
*  We're all underpaid and listen,
*  and to the major institutions, Stanford, UCLA
*  and all other major institutions, pay them more, please.
*  We need them and they need to have a standard of living.
*  I'm not afraid to say that despite my primary employer,
*  they need it, they deserve it.
*  They deserve it, absolutely.
*  Great, well, we will absolutely have you back again
*  if you'll be willing.
*  And meanwhile, we will direct people
*  to where they can learn more about you and your exciting work.
*  And once again, thanks so much.
*  Thank you so much.
*  Thank you for joining me today for my discussion
*  about sleep, mental health, physical health and performance
*  with Dr. Gina Po.
*  I hope you found it to be as informative
*  and as actionable as I did.
*  In fact, I'm already implementing the regularity of bedtime,
*  plus or minus half an hour
*  in order to get that growth hormone release.
*  And I can already see both my sleep scores improving
*  and my feelings of daytime vigor and focus
*  and other markers of sleep health improving as well.
