# Dr. Adam Grant: How to Unlock Your Potential, Motivation & Unique Abilities
**Andrew Huberman:** [November 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gtvNYa3Nd8)
*  Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
*  where we discuss science
*  and science-based tools for everyday life.
*  I'm Andrew Huberman,
*  and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
*  at Stanford School of Medicine.
*  My guest today is Dr. Adam Grant.
*  Adam Grant is a professor of organizational psychology
*  at the Wharton School at University of Pennsylvania.
*  He has authored five bestselling books,
*  and most recently has authored a new book
*  entitled, Hidden Potential.
*  He received his bachelor's degree from Harvard University
*  and his doctorate from the University of Michigan.
*  Today we discuss peer-reviewed studies and tools
*  based on the data from those studies
*  that can enable people to meet their goals
*  and overcome significant challenges,
*  including how to overcome procrastination,
*  as well as how to see around or through blind spots,
*  as well as how to overcome sticking points
*  in motivation and creativity.
*  We also discuss the research on and practical tools
*  related to the underpinnings of performance in any endeavor,
*  including how to increase one's confidence
*  and how to have a persistent growth mindset.
*  By the end of today's episode,
*  it will be clear to you that Dr. Adam Grant
*  has an absolutely spectacular depth and breadth of knowledge,
*  and that knowledge is both practical,
*  it is based on peer-reviewed research,
*  and he conveys those tools
*  with the utmost clarity and generosity.
*  Indeed, by the end of today's episode,
*  you will have more than a dozen new tools
*  never discussed before on the Huberman Lab podcast
*  that you can apply in your academic endeavors,
*  in athletic endeavors, in creative endeavors,
*  in fact, in any area of life.
*  Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
*  is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
*  It is, however, part of my desire and effort
*  to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
*  and science-related tools to the general public.
*  In keeping with that theme,
*  I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
*  Our first sponsor is 8Sleep.
*  8Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling, heating,
*  and sleep tracking capacity.
*  I've spoken many times before in this podcast
*  about the fact that getting a great night's sleep
*  really is the foundation of mental health,
*  physical health, and performance.
*  One of the key things to getting a great night's sleep
*  is to make sure that the temperature
*  of your sleeping environment is correct,
*  and that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep,
*  your body temperature actually has to drop
*  by about one to three degrees,
*  and in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized,
*  your body temperature actually has to increase
*  by about one to three degrees.
*  With 8Sleep, you can program the temperature
*  of your sleeping environment in the beginning, middle,
*  and end of your night.
*  It has a number of other features,
*  like tracking the amount of rapid eye movement
*  and slow wave sleep that you get,
*  things that are essential to really dialing in
*  the perfect night's sleep for you.
*  I've been sleeping on an 8Sleep mattress cover
*  for well over two years now,
*  and it has greatly improved my sleep.
*  I fall asleep far more quickly,
*  I wake up far less often in the middle of the night,
*  and I wake up feeling far more refreshed
*  than I ever did prior to using an 8Sleep mattress cover.
*  If you'd like to try 8Sleep,
*  go to 8sleep.com slash Huberman.
*  Now through November 30th, as a special holiday discount,
*  8Sleep is offering $500 off their bundles with a pod cover.
*  8Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, the UK,
*  select countries in the EU and Australia.
*  Again, that's 8sleep.com slash Huberman.
*  Today's episode is also brought to us by Levels.
*  Levels is a program that lets you see
*  how different foods affect your health
*  by giving you real-time feedback on your diet
*  using a continuous glucose monitor.
*  One of the most important factors
*  in your immediate and long-term health
*  is your blood sugar or blood glucose regulation.
*  With Levels, you can see how different foods
*  and food combinations, exercise, and sleep patterns
*  impact your blood glucose levels.
*  It's very easy to use,
*  you just put the monitor on the back of your arm,
*  and then you take your phone
*  and you scan it over that monitor now and again,
*  and it downloads the data about your blood sugar levels
*  in the preceding hours.
*  Using Levels has allowed me to learn a tremendous amount
*  about what works best for me in terms of nutrition,
*  exercise, work schedules, and sleep.
*  So if you're interested in learning more about Levels
*  and trying a continuous glucose monitor,
*  you can go to levels.link slash Huberman.
*  Levels has launched a new CGM sensor that is smaller
*  and has even better tracking than the previous version.
*  Right now, they're also offering
*  an additional two free months of membership.
*  Again, that's levels.link slash Huberman
*  to try the new sensor and two free months of membership.
*  Today's episode is also brought to us by Waking Up.
*  Waking Up is a meditation app
*  that includes hundreds of meditation programs,
*  mindfulness trainings, yoga nidra sessions,
*  and NSDR, non-sleep deep rest protocols.
*  I started using the Waking Up app a few years ago
*  because even though I've been doing regular meditation
*  since my teens, and I started doing yoga nidra
*  about a decade ago, my dad mentioned to me
*  that he had found an app, turned out to be the Waking Up app,
*  which could teach you meditations of different durations
*  and that had a lot of different types of meditations
*  to place the brain and body into different states
*  and that he liked it very much.
*  So I gave the Waking Up app a try
*  and I too found it to be extremely useful
*  because sometimes I only have a few minutes to meditate,
*  other times I have longer to meditate.
*  And indeed, I love the fact that I can explore
*  different types of meditation to bring about
*  different levels of understanding about consciousness,
*  but also to place my brain and body
*  into lots of different kinds of states,
*  depending on which meditation I do.
*  I also love that the Waking Up app
*  has lots of different types of yoga nidra sessions.
*  For those of you who don't know,
*  yoga nidra is a process of lying very still,
*  but keeping an active mind.
*  It's very different than most meditations.
*  And there's excellent scientific data
*  to show that yoga nidra and something similar to it
*  called non-sleep deep rest or NSDR
*  can greatly restore levels of cognitive and physical energy,
*  even with just a short 10 minute session.
*  If you'd like to try the Waking Up app,
*  you can go to wakingup.com slash Huberman
*  and access a free 30 day trial.
*  Again, that's wakingup.com slash Huberman
*  to access a free 30 day trial.
*  And now for my discussion with Dr. Adam Grant.
*  Adam, welcome.
*  Excited to be here.
*  Very excited to have you here.
*  Your career, both public facing and academic career
*  covered an enormous range of topics.
*  So we have a lot to cover.
*  Look who's talking.
*  And anytime two professors sit down,
*  or even one professor says, we have a lot to cover.
*  I think everyone listening braces themselves like,
*  oh no, but these topics,
*  I assure everyone are of the utmost interest
*  and you cover them in such both fabulous detail
*  and you make it very clear.
*  So I'm really looking forward to this.
*  I'd like to start off by talking about something
*  that I'm obsessed by.
*  And I know a lot of people are obsessed with
*  and struggle with.
*  And I know you also have a recent publication on this topic,
*  which is procrastination.
*  I am a bit of a procrastinator,
*  but a different way of stating that is that I love deadlines.
*  I learned in college that I love, love, love deadlines
*  because it seems to harness my focus and my attention.
*  I like just enough, I guess you call it anxiety
*  or autonomic arousal for the neuroscience
*  or physiology oriented folks.
*  For me just brings about a total elimination
*  of all of the distractors.
*  And it seems to both slow and accelerate
*  my perception of time.
*  And it seems to bring out my best to have deadlines.
*  But I would prefer to not have to procrastinate
*  in order to self-impose deadlines.
*  I prefer that other people impose those deadlines in fact.
*  So what do we know about procrastination?
*  Why do some people complete things well in advance?
*  Why do other people procrastinate?
*  Is it that they're seeking deadlines as I believe I am?
*  And interestingly, and sort of alluding
*  to this recent paper of yours,
*  what is the relationship between procrastination
*  and creativity?
*  I feel like we should just deal with all that later.
*  Let's put it off.
*  No.
*  Good one.
*  By the way, there's extra credit for science funds on here.
*  So nicely done.
*  One of the best articles on procrastination ever written
*  was titled, At Last, My Article on Procrastination.
*  Fantastic.
*  I love it.
*  Yeah, it just made me smile.
*  So I think the basic question I think to start with
*  is why do we procrastinate?
*  And I thought I was immune actually
*  when I came into this topic.
*  I was the person who annoyed my college roommates
*  by finishing my thesis a couple months early.
*  I found out there was a term for me, I'm a precrastinator.
*  So the focus and the pressure that you get from a deadline,
*  I get that the moment the project starts
*  and sometimes months or years in advance.
*  And so I was really proud of finishing everything early.
*  And then I discovered there are things
*  that I procrastinate on too,
*  which was a little bit disappointing.
*  Are you willing to share what some of those were?
*  I am.
*  So I procrastinate on anything that's administrative.
*  So.
*  I'm right there with you.
*  You wanna get time on my calendar?
*  It could take me weeks to respond.
*  You asked me a question about social science.
*  I will be back to you in a minute.
*  I procrastinate on grading.
*  Takes me forever.
*  I basically put off a whole bunch of tasks
*  that I thought had nothing in common.
*  It turns out that I procrastinate when I'm bored.
*  Boredom is, I guess it's probably my most hated emotion.
*  And so I will do anything to avoid a boring task.
*  And I think this goes to why people procrastinate,
*  which is a lot of people think it's laziness
*  or you're not disciplined enough,
*  but actually the research on this is really clear
*  that you're not avoiding work when you procrastinate.
*  In fact, a lot of our procrastination
*  is focused on doing things that involve a lot of energy.
*  You've seen people probably clean their entire houses
*  when they're putting off a task.
*  So it's not that you're being lazy,
*  it's that you're avoiding negative emotions
*  that a task starts up.
*  So for me, it's boredom.
*  For a lot of people, it's fear or anxiety.
*  I don't know if I can pull this off.
*  I have an extreme case of imposter syndrome in this role.
*  The challenge in front of me is too daunting.
*  For some people it's confusion.
*  I haven't figured it out yet.
*  And so I can't work on this because I feel like I'm stuck.
*  So what's, I guess the big question for you then, Andrew,
*  is what's the emotion that causes you to procrastinate?
*  It's hard for me to identify the stick here.
*  I think of it more as the carrot that comes with deadlines.
*  And again, I don't consider myself
*  a procrastinator per se.
*  I just really love deadlines.
*  And procrastination is a terrific way
*  to simulate the deadline.
*  So for me-
*  So you, wait, so you delay starting or finishing a task
*  in order to have a sense of time pressure?
*  That's right.
*  It builds a certain amount of internal arousal in me to know,
*  okay, I've got 72 hours to complete something
*  and it's now game time.
*  I like the game time before the game time.
*  Before a podcast, I'll put in anywhere from several days
*  to weeks or even months in preparation.
*  So it's really elastic depending on the topic.
*  But when it came to exams in school,
*  or if it comes to writing deadlines,
*  I consider the shipping of the product
*  or the presentation of the live event
*  that I happen to be doing as the second game or event.
*  The first event is the pressure and the excitement
*  of getting into the groove of doing focused work.
*  Because for me, that's such a drug.
*  I mean, it feels like having all the systems
*  of my brain and body oriented towards one specific thing
*  is just sheer bliss for me.
*  So it sounds like then you're actually not
*  a chronic procrastinator.
*  Thank you.
*  That's never been the way I viewed myself,
*  but now I'll take that.
*  It's a strategy for you.
*  It is a strategy.
*  That's right.
*  And I was fairly wayward youth,
*  barely finished high school, et cetera.
*  So by time I got serious about school,
*  which was my second year of university,
*  when deadlines were presented,
*  there's a midterm exam on a given date,
*  that was exciting to me.
*  That was exciting.
*  It was like, okay, that's the big thing.
*  That's my opportunity to prove myself to myself
*  because I was really coming from behind.
*  And then the opportunity to,
*  or I should say the feeling of dropping into that groove,
*  this is the exciting part is the preparation.
*  Likewise with podcasting, for our solo podcast,
*  I love the research as much as I love
*  presenting the material.
*  Maybe more. Maybe more.
*  Likewise for university lectures
*  or for traveling and giving seminars
*  as a traditional academic.
*  I'm sure you're familiar with that.
*  Of course.
*  The preparation is where you realize,
*  it's almost like I think of it as somebody
*  like a miner in a mine and just finding a gem.
*  And of course then there are all the thoughts
*  of what you can do with that later.
*  And you're gonna show people it has a certain value
*  to the world, et cetera.
*  But it's the searching and finding those gems
*  that is like, even as I talk about it,
*  I feel like my body's gonna float out of the chair
*  a little bit.
*  I have the same experience.
*  It's the sort of the unleashed curiosity
*  and then the rush of discovery.
*  And by the time you're teaching it or explaining it,
*  like, but I already know this.
*  Like I'm not learning anything anymore.
*  And yes, I'm excited to share it
*  and I hope it's helpful to other people.
*  So I think as you talk about what your process looks like,
*  I don't even think what you do
*  qualifies as procrastination, technically.
*  It seems to getting better and better.
*  Seriously, if you think about how procrastination is defined,
*  it's delaying despite an expected cost.
*  And you don't think there's a cost,
*  you actually see a benefit.
*  That's right.
*  And I've tried starting-
*  That's not procrastination, that's just delay.
*  Yeah, I've tried starting things earlier.
*  And I should say that my process often begins
*  much earlier than the physical process.
*  Like if I was being observed in an experiment,
*  okay, Andrew's finally sitting down
*  to write this book chapter,
*  or finally sitting down to research
*  some papers for an episode.
*  But I'm thinking about it all the time.
*  Much to the dismay of people in my life.
*  I'm constantly thinking about these things.
*  I mean, walking to take out the recycle, I'll have ideas.
*  And then I'll write them down.
*  I constantly am writing things down,
*  voice memos into my phone.
*  I have a method of capture where I basically try
*  and just grab everything and then filter out what's useful.
*  Do you have a process like that for gleaning ideas?
*  A little bit, I do now.
*  So when Ji-Hye Shen and I started this research
*  on procrastination, she had come to me,
*  she was a very creative doctoral student,
*  and she said, I have my best ideas when I'm procrastinating.
*  And it was one of those moments where I didn't believe her,
*  but I thought it was an interesting enough idea
*  that it was worth exploring.
*  And I said, show me, let's get some data,
*  let's see if we can test this.
*  And she ended up gathering data in a Korean company
*  where she surveyed people on how often they procrastinate
*  and then got their supervisors to rate their creativity.
*  And sure enough, found that people who procrastinate
*  sometimes were rated as more creative
*  than people who rarely do, like me, the procrastinators.
*  And I remember asking her,
*  what about the chronic procrastinators?
*  And she's like, I don't know,
*  they never filled out my survey.
*  Yeah, as I recall from that paper,
*  there's an inverted U-shaped function
*  with procrastination on the vertical axis
*  and creativity on the horizontal axis.
*  Flip, sorry.
*  Okay, so explain to me then the relationship
*  between procrastination and creativity.
*  Yeah, so basically the peak of creativity
*  is in the middle of procrastination.
*  Okay, got it.
*  And yeah, there's an upside down U-curve there.
*  And so then, I thought this was fascinating.
*  So then we go into the lab to say, can we replicate this?
*  Can we control it in an experiment?
*  And the hardest part of that was,
*  how do you randomly assign people to procrastinate?
*  To my knowledge, never been done before.
*  And we eventually figured out that we could
*  give people a bunch of tasks to do
*  and then tempt them with highly entertaining YouTube videos
*  that were placed on their screen.
*  And we put different numbers of YouTube videos there
*  so that if there's only one,
*  you're not tempted to procrastinate much.
*  If there are four, you're probably gonna get sucked
*  into a little bit of a YouTube spiral.
*  If there are eight, you might be putting off the task
*  that's much less exciting than watching Jimmy Kimball's
*  mean tweets, for example.
*  And this was done in a fairly naturalistic environment
*  for these folks?
*  Yeah, people are on a computer.
*  They're asked to solve some creative problems
*  that look pretty similar to what you might do in your job.
*  And then we're gonna score your creativity later.
*  And it turned out that the people who were attempted
*  to procrastinate moderately
*  ended up generating the most creative ideas.
*  So why is that?
*  There are a couple things that happen
*  and you have to look at both sides of the curve.
*  So what's wrong with the procrastinators
*  and also what happens to the extreme procrastinators?
*  And in both cases, what happens is
*  you end up with a little bit of tunnel vision.
*  So when I dive right into a task,
*  I'm stuck with my first ideas.
*  And I don't wait long enough to incubate
*  and get my best ideas.
*  I'm less likely to reframe the problem.
*  I'm less likely to access remote knowledge
*  because I'm just diving right in.
*  And meanwhile, the chronic procrastinators
*  end up in the same boat
*  because they don't get started until the last minute.
*  And so they have to rush ahead
*  with the easiest idea to implement
*  as opposed to really developing the most novel idea.
*  And meanwhile, the people in the middle
*  who are starting to feel that pressure of,
*  like, wow, I spun my wheels for 10 minutes
*  watching a bunch of YouTube videos.
*  I'm running out of time for this task.
*  They still have enough time to work on the ideas
*  that were active in the back of their minds.
*  And that gives them a shot at more novel ideas.
*  So I've tried to adopt this, to answer your question,
*  I've tried to adopt this as my process now,
*  to say I will still dive into a project ahead of schedule,
*  but I will not commit to an idea
*  until I've let it incubate for a few weeks
*  and I'm working on other things.
*  Whereas an earlier version of me,
*  like when I'd sit down to write a book,
*  as soon as I had the book idea,
*  I would start writing on day one.
*  Now I have the idea, I file it away,
*  and I give myself at least a month before I began drafting.
*  And I think it feels less productive,
*  but it's far more creative.
*  What are your thoughts about some of what you described
*  being an unconscious way of seeding the mind
*  and the unconscious with an idea?
*  So for instance, let's take a school academic scenario
*  where students get an assignment
*  and the assignment is contained within a folder
*  and it just says assignment, okay?
*  And it's due on a particular date
*  and it says due on that particular date.
*  And they're given the folder,
*  but they have no sense of what the assignment is.
*  You can imagine one category of procrastinator
*  that will take that thing and put it down
*  and avoid looking at it entirely
*  versus another category of procrastinator
*  that will flip it open and take a look at,
*  okay, this is going to be an essay on,
*  I don't know, something about economic theory
*  in the late 1700s.
*  Close it and then procrastinate.
*  There is an idea, which frankly I subscribe to a little bit
*  because we recently did this series on mental health,
*  not mental illness, but mental health
*  with Dr. Paul Conte where he talked extensively
*  about the unconscious and how the unconscious mind
*  is always working with ideas,
*  things that we are concerned about,
*  performance, these sorts of things,
*  even if we're not aware of them.
*  What are your thoughts about the creativity
*  that's seeded by slight procrastination
*  being related to actually knowing
*  what you're procrastinating on specifically?
*  I think it turns out to be,
*  I don't want to say essential, but critical.
*  So one of the things we found is
*  in order for moderate procrastination to fuel creativity,
*  you have to be intrinsically motivated
*  by the thing you're procrastinating on.
*  Interesting.
*  And so what happens is if you're bored, for example,
*  by the topic, you're not gonna open the folder.
*  You're not gonna start thinking about it at all.
*  It's not gonna begin,
*  you're not gonna do any subconscious processing.
*  You're not gonna have any unexpected connections
*  between this topic and something else you've learned about
*  or been curious about.
*  If you're interested in the problem,
*  then when you put it off,
*  you're much more likely to still keep it active
*  in the back of your mind.
*  And that's when you begin to see,
*  I imagine you could explain the biology of this.
*  I imagine, for example,
*  there are probably more neural networks
*  that are connecting.
*  You probably get access to ideas
*  that have been sort of separate nodes.
*  And so I think that you wanna know what the topic is.
*  You don't wanna just see the blank assignment.
*  But you also have to find a reason
*  that this is exciting to you.
*  Otherwise, you're gonna avoid it
*  as opposed to letting it percolate.
*  That brings us to the topic of intrinsic motivation.
*  And I'd like to link that up with the topic of performance.
*  So when I was in university,
*  there were many topics that I was excited to learn about,
*  some more than others, of course.
*  But occasionally, I'd be in a class
*  or I'd get an assignment
*  that frankly I had minimal interest in.
*  Never zero, but minimal interest.
*  And as a way of dealing with that,
*  I embarked on a process of literally lying to myself
*  and just telling myself,
*  okay, I'm super interested in reading this
*  and I'm gonna force myself to be interested in reading it.
*  And lo and behold,
*  I would start falling in love with certain things.
*  Maybe it was even the arrival of a word
*  that I didn't recognize.
*  And then I would go look it up
*  and I knew I was studying for the GRE at that time.
*  So I had to file that away.
*  I still have my notebooks of all the vocabulary words
*  that I learned in the course of my university courses
*  that frankly made the verbal portion of the GRE pretty easy,
*  which if you ever try and study for that at the end,
*  it's pretty tough to commit all those new words
*  to memory and context.
*  So I could find little hooks
*  and through those hooks,
*  I could kind of ratchet my way into a larger interest
*  and then lo and behold,
*  I'm really interested in Greek mythology.
*  Or I actually liked that one at first,
*  but I didn't have to trick myself.
*  But maybe we could spend a little bit of time
*  talking about what is true intrinsic motivation?
*  Is it always reflexive?
*  Can we make ourselves intrinsically motivated
*  about a given topic or scenario or group of people?
*  And then let's talk about
*  how intrinsic motivation links to performance
*  because there's a rich literature on this, as I recall.
*  And I remember the Stanford study of rewarding kids
*  for things that were already motivated to do.
*  Maybe we could touch on that a little bit
*  and remind people who haven't heard about it.
*  But I'm fascinated by this topic
*  because I feel like so much of life
*  is about doing things that initially
*  we don't feel that excited to do.
*  And yet succeeding in life,
*  until you can afford to offload your administrative work
*  to somebody else, which hopefully by now you have.
*  That's a fine way to get it done.
*  Right.
*  This is fundamental to being a functional human being,
*  frankly, not just successful in air quotes, but functional.
*  We got to do stuff that we don't enjoy doing.
*  Yeah, so I think we can talk about a couple of different ways
*  to nurture intrinsic motivation.
*  We can think about how the task itself is designed.
*  We can think about reward systems.
*  And then we can think about also the things
*  we say to ourselves and others,
*  which I hope are not lies, but rather persuasive attempts.
*  Let's start on that one, actually.
*  I don't know a lot of people who are that good
*  at deliberate self-deception.
*  Well, I like to think it was only around
*  a particular set of goal-motivated pursuits.
*  But at that time for me also, survival.
*  As I mentioned, I didn't do well in high school.
*  I really wanted to perform well in university.
*  But I knew that working just for the grade
*  wasn't going to carry me.
*  It felt catabolic.
*  And I don't know, maybe at that age,
*  I was still in the window of heightened neuroplasticity.
*  We know it never closes.
*  But I think I also fell in love with the process
*  of learning how to do what I just described.
*  Yeah, so I think for most people,
*  the best method of self-persuasion
*  is actually to convince somebody else.
*  So I'm thinking of Elliot Aronson's classic research
*  on cognitive dissonance, where he would ask you
*  to go and tell somebody else a task you hated
*  is really interesting.
*  And if he paid you a lot to do it,
*  you still hated the task because you had a justification.
*  Like, I got 20 bucks to kind of fib
*  a little bit about this task.
*  The task is bad, but I did it for the payment.
*  When he paid you $1 to go and tell somebody
*  that you loved a task that you didn't,
*  you ended up liking it more.
*  Wow.
*  And maybe I shouldn't be surprised,
*  but maybe you should tell me why I shouldn't be surprised.
*  Because I hope people got what you just said very clearly.
*  And if they didn't, if you don't like doing something,
*  going and reporting to somebody else
*  how great that thing is, so lying about it to somebody else,
*  is one way to increase the degree to which you like
*  or enjoy that behavior or topic.
*  And if you're paid $20 to go lie to somebody
*  in the positive direction, so against your true belief,
*  it's less effective in shifting your underlying affect
*  about that thing, your emotions,
*  than if you're paid less, correct?
*  Exactly.
*  Now, I think obviously in the experiment,
*  lying was an easy way to show the effect.
*  But in real life, I think the way that you want to apply this
*  is to say, all right, I've got to find something
*  about this task that's interesting to me.
*  And then in the process of explaining it to somebody else,
*  I'm going to convince myself because I'm hearing the argument
*  from somebody I already like and trust.
*  And I've also chosen the reasons that I find compelling
*  as opposed to hearing somebody else's reasons.
*  And so I think this goes to the point that you were making,
*  which is if you're trying to find a hook
*  to make a topic intriguing, you've got to figure out,
*  okay, what is it that would make this fascinating to me?
*  And in a lot of cases,
*  what you're looking for is a curiosity gap.
*  I think social scientists like to talk about curiosity
*  as an itch that you have to scratch.
*  So there's something you want to know,
*  and you don't know it yet.
*  So I would say, I tell my students often,
*  take your least favorite class and find a mystery or a puzzle,
*  like something that you just do not know the answer to.
*  Actually, I've talked with our kids about this,
*  what really happened to King Tut?
*  Do you know?
*  Can you get to the bottom of that?
*  And all of a sudden, I wonder, I need to Google it,
*  and then I need to see if Wikipedia
*  has credible information on this.
*  And the more you learn about that,
*  the more intriguing it becomes.
*  And I think that's the beginning of the process
*  of finding intrinsic motivation.
*  I see.
*  So inherent in your answer is the idea
*  that there's something wired into our neural circuits,
*  and therefore psychology, that curiosity as a verb,
*  the act of being curious and seeking information,
*  where, well, and I should say, I define curiosity,
*  and hopefully you'll disagree with me or agree either way,
*  it doesn't matter as long as we can get
*  a bit deeper understanding.
*  I define curiosity as a desire to find something out
*  where you are not attached to a particular outcome.
*  Yes.
*  Is that right?
*  Yeah, in psychology, it's typically defined
*  as just wanting to know.
*  And that means you're driven by the question,
*  not a particular answer,
*  which is exactly what you're driving at.
*  Okay, great.
*  So, and I think it was Dorothy Parker that said,
*  the cure for boredom is curiosity.
*  There is no cure for curiosity.
*  As there shouldn't be a cure for curiosity.
*  So, and by the way, folks,
*  we don't know what neural circuits
*  subserve curiosity in the brain.
*  It's gotta be a distributed network.
*  There's no brain area for curiosity,
*  but it's gotta be linked up with the reward systems
*  of dopamine, et cetera, in some way,
*  because when one discovers something new
*  that satisfies some curiosity,
*  it's clearly there's an internal reward there.
*  Okay, let me back up.
*  So, if your child or an adult is dreading exploring a topic
*  or going about an assignment of any kind,
*  you will give them a question that they then need to resolve.
*  What if the assignment is like,
*  rake the leaves off the front lawn?
*  Do you say, you know, count the leaves or, I mean,
*  how does one get past the sort of procrastination
*  and generate some intrinsic motivation
*  for things that one dreads where it's unlikely
*  that they're going to discover some knowledge
*  that's exceedingly useful for future?
*  You always start with, okay,
*  what's the first experiment I can run?
*  Find the most interesting looking leaf
*  for your favorite leaf,
*  and then that lasts for about two minutes,
*  and like, okay, no, we still have a lot of leaves there.
*  I think not all tasks can be made
*  intrinsically motivating to everyone.
*  And so, when intrinsic motivation is difficult to find,
*  what you wanna substitute with is a sense of purpose.
*  Maybe a better way to say that is,
*  when the process is not interesting to you,
*  you need to find a meaningful outcome.
*  So, there's some research on the boring
*  but important effect,
*  where kids who have a purpose for learning,
*  this goes through high school,
*  and think, you know, this is not just interesting to me,
*  but I'm gonna be able to use this knowledge
*  to help other people one day.
*  They're more persistent in their studying,
*  they end up getting better grades,
*  and so, I think, you know, intrinsic motivation
*  is often driven by curiosity about the how.
*  A sense of purpose comes from really thinking hard
*  about the why, why does this matter?
*  And so, I'd say with the raking leaves,
*  let's try to connect that task
*  to something else that you care about.
*  Are you going to pleasantly surprise your parents
*  when they get home?
*  Are you going to have a place to play soccer
*  that you didn't before?
*  And I think then, the process of getting to that,
*  I guess what I'd say is,
*  if you're trying to motivate yourself,
*  it's a little bit harder
*  than if you're trying to motivate somebody else on this.
*  If I was gonna motivate somebody else,
*  I would take a page out
*  of the motivational interviewing playbook,
*  where I would say, okay, Andrew,
*  actually, let's play this out for a second.
*  So, you're gonna rake a pile of leaves,
*  it's a two hour task, zero to 10,
*  how excited are you about that?
*  A three.
*  Three, really?
*  I'm surprised, I thought you were gonna say zero or one.
*  Why is it not lower?
*  I like any sort of physical activity
*  because it allows me to move,
*  and I just like moving my body.
*  There we go, okay, so you just identified
*  a potential source of purpose for that activity.
*  And I don't have a vested interest
*  in convincing you to do this task.
*  I am genuinely curious about what would motivate you
*  to want to do it.
*  And as you start to articulate it,
*  boom, self persuasion kicks in.
*  Love it.
*  I'm gonna start using these approaches.
*  Try it at your own risk.
*  As we all know, quality nutrition influences,
*  of course, our physical health,
*  but also our mental health and our cognitive functioning,
*  our memory, our ability to learn new things and to focus.
*  And we know that one of the most important features
*  of high quality nutrition is making sure
*  that we get enough vitamins and minerals
*  from high quality, unprocessed or minimally processed sources,
*  as well as enough probiotics and prebiotics and fiber
*  to support basically all the cellular functions in our body,
*  including the gut microbiome.
*  Now, I, like most everybody,
*  try to get optimal nutrition from whole foods,
*  ideally, mostly from minimally processed
*  or non-processed foods.
*  However, one of the challenges that I
*  and so many other people face is getting enough servings
*  of high quality fruits and vegetables per day,
*  as well as fiber and probiotics
*  that often accompany those fruits and vegetables.
*  That's why way back in 2012,
*  long before I ever had a podcast,
*  I started drinking AG1.
*  And so I'm delighted that AG1
*  is sponsoring the Huberman Lab podcast.
*  The reason I started taking AG1
*  and the reason I still drink AG1 once or twice a day
*  is that it provides all of my foundational nutritional needs.
*  That is, it provides insurance
*  that I get the proper amounts of those vitamins, minerals,
*  probiotics and fiber to ensure optimal mental health,
*  physical health and performance.
*  If you'd like to try AG1,
*  you can go to drinkag1.com slash Huberman
*  to claim a special offer.
*  They're giving away five free travel packs
*  plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
*  Again, that's drinkag1.com slash Huberman
*  to claim that special offer.
*  I have a question about extrinsic motivation.
*  So if we grow up being incentivized by extrinsic things,
*  you'll get your allowance if you blank.
*  You can spend the money that you make
*  and on your paper route
*  doing the things you really want to do.
*  Is there any value in those kinds
*  of learning-based incentives for kids and for adults?
*  Because that's the real world as well.
*  I know plenty of people,
*  I have family members that only work for a paycheck
*  and they're pretty okay
*  because they like spending their paycheck.
*  Probably more than, I'm not intrinsically attached to money.
*  I mean, I certainly have needs in life,
*  but I don't enjoy spending money for the sake of spending it
*  or for gaining more possessions.
*  But I know people that do and I certainly don't judge.
*  Are they somehow existing
*  in a diminished landscape of happiness
*  because they seem pretty happy to me.
*  But they seem to have also worked out this relationship.
*  They do certain things to get the extrinsic rewards
*  and they really enjoy what they can do
*  with those extrinsic rewards.
*  So there's a huge body of evidence
*  on what are the effects of extrinsic rewards
*  on motivation and performance.
*  And I think the latest conclusions,
*  if you look at the latest meta-analyses,
*  so huge study of studies trying to accumulate
*  what's the average effect of adding a financial incentive
*  to a task that wasn't incentivized before
*  or to a job where you were paid salary
*  and now we're gonna give you incentive compensation.
*  There is a boost.
*  So in general, people are more productive
*  when they're incentivized for their output.
*  But these incentives are better
*  for motivating quantity than quality.
*  So you see people get more done,
*  but they're not necessarily more careful or more thorough.
*  Are they less careful and less thorough?
*  No.
*  Actually, there's still positive effects on average.
*  They're just weaker.
*  And of course, you could then start to say,
*  well, how do I incentivize being fast and careful?
*  But I think where we do have to be really cautious
*  is there's an undermining effect of extrinsic rewards
*  on intrinsic motivation.
*  And you were alluding to this earlier,
*  dating back to the early 70s,
*  where we know that if we take an interesting task
*  and then we pay you for it,
*  you might conclude that you're only doing it for the outcome
*  and you lose interest in the task.
*  So the classic demonstration,
*  Mark Lepper and colleagues is kids playing video games
*  and they're playing them because they're fun.
*  And then you start to add in an incentive.
*  And then when the incentive is taken away,
*  they don't wanna play anymore
*  because the meaning of the task has changed.
*  And now I'm doing it
*  because I wanna get something out of it
*  as opposed to I love the process.
*  I think that that phenomenon does not have to exist.
*  So we know, for example, at work,
*  managers, as long as they give people autonomy,
*  they don't present the rewards in a controlling way.
*  So instead of saying, Andrew, in order to earn this,
*  you need to do the following work.
*  If they say, hey, look, I'd really love it
*  if you would deliver the following.
*  And in order to make that worth your while,
*  I'm offering this incentive.
*  People react very differently
*  when they have a sense of choice and control.
*  So I think that that's, I guess, the starting point.
*  In the presence of autonomy,
*  I don't think there's a major downside
*  of extrinsic rewards.
*  I think you also have to be careful that,
*  yeah, I guess that you're not over-justifying the task.
*  In other words, you're not swamping people's
*  intrinsic reason for doing it,
*  but you're adding a reason to try it.
*  So actually, if we go to a different domain for a second,
*  so look at kids who don't wanna eat their vegetables.
*  Extrinsic incentives are very effective
*  to get kids to try vegetables for the first time.
*  But then the hope is that they discover a vegetable or two
*  that they don't mind,
*  and then they find reasons to keep doing it.
*  And I think that that's how I want a lot of rewards to work.
*  I don't think that rewards should be carrots
*  that we dangle to try to control people's behavior.
*  I think they should be symbols of how much we appreciate
*  and value a particular behavior.
*  And if you frame them that way,
*  it's a lot easier for people to say, yeah, you know what?
*  That reward is something that I really want,
*  but I'm not only doing the task for that reward.
*  Yeah, you basically answered the question I was going to ask,
*  which is, and at risk of sounding new agey,
*  but we are sitting in California.
*  I could imagine that when one is focused
*  on the extrinsic rewards,
*  so a physical task or a cognitive task
*  for an extrinsic reward,
*  if I'm focusing on the extrinsic reward,
*  I'm also, air quotes again, not present, right?
*  I'm thinking about the outcome,
*  I'm not thinking about process.
*  And I think there's,
*  perhaps you can flesh out some of what this is exactly,
*  but I think there's a fairly extensive data
*  to support the idea that when we are physically
*  and mentally present to the task,
*  that we're going to perform better.
*  And presumably our intrinsic liking of that task
*  or performing that task increases as well.
*  Is that true?
*  Yeah, I think so.
*  So if we want to break down the mechanisms
*  for why intrinsic motivation is useful for performance,
*  one, you touched on earlier, it's focus of attention.
*  It's much easier to find flow
*  when you're intrinsically motivated.
*  You get into that state of deep absorption
*  where time melts away.
*  So you mentioned, sort of either speeding up
*  or slowing down your sense of time.
*  You forget where you are,
*  sometimes you even lose track of your identity
*  and you're just merged into the task.
*  And so that concentration is helpful.
*  There's also a greater persistence effect
*  that when you enjoy what you're doing,
*  you're less likely to give up in the face of obstacles.
*  You're more likely to think about it
*  when you're not doing the task
*  and come up with great ideas.
*  And so, I think there's a working harder,
*  there's a working longer, there's a working smarter,
*  and there's also a thinking more clearly effect.
*  This is a brief but related tangent.
*  One of the things that I've found incredibly difficult
*  in recent years is that, most of my life,
*  really since I was a small kid,
*  I was forging for things.
*  And then, I used to give lectures on Monday in class
*  if they let me until they eventually stopped me
*  about the stuff I was reading about all weekend.
*  So, got an early start and the professorial front.
*  But now, if I'm reading something and I discover
*  what I think is a really valuable piece of information
*  or a tool or a protocol, like, wow, this is really cool.
*  These findings are oh so cool.
*  There's a problem, which is that now,
*  I have an opportunity to cast that out to the world
*  through social media.
*  We all do.
*  This could be-
*  Wait, I'm sorry, you're on social media?
*  From time to time.
*  You're all over my feeds.
*  You and I both do our own social media, by the way,
*  which I really appreciate.
*  I think one can always detect if someone else
*  is handling someone's social media.
*  So, yes, I'm on social media.
*  And I love that I have the opportunity
*  to both send out ideas and information
*  and also receive feedback.
*  I really love the comment section.
*  And I always encourage comments.
*  I learn from it, frankly.
*  Love is a strong word.
*  I learn from it.
*  And you and I were weaned in the academic culture
*  where, frankly, the kind of hazing
*  that one receives in academic culture is very different
*  than the kind of hazing that one receives on social media.
*  But let's just say that if you come up through academia,
*  you develop a pretty thick skin.
*  I agree with that.
*  I do have to say, though, that there was a part of me
*  that was really surprised when I started posting on social
*  that I love constructive criticism.
*  I was unprepared for the number of people
*  who will knee-jerk, criticize a study
*  without even looking at whether the methods are rigorous.
*  I'm like, come on, if I posted this,
*  surely it's at least worth considering the possibility
*  that there's strong evidence behind it.
*  Well, that's where a brief, I won't call it a retort,
*  but a response of, clearly, you should read the study further
*  because I think you'll be satisfied with the answer
*  or something, I don't know.
*  But I agree.
*  It can be a little bit harsh in there sometimes.
*  But the social media channels are,
*  I think they have, it's a double-edged blade.
*  They obviously have their issues,
*  but can be a wonderful opportunity to share information
*  and share it quickly.
*  The problem is that it takes me out of
*  what I was doing initially, which was learning,
*  searching for those gems which to share later.
*  And I think there's a broader landscape to consider this
*  where people, for instance, are,
*  I was at the beach yesterday.
*  It was just absolutely spectacular day at the beach,
*  especially for this time of year.
*  And everyone was taking pictures of that experience
*  on their phone and probably sharing that experience,
*  either social media or with friends.
*  This is very different than taking a photograph
*  and not seeing that photograph until later
*  or not sending it out.
*  And so there are now near infinite number of circumstances
*  where we are taken out of the rewarding experience.
*  I should rephrase that.
*  We are taking ourselves out of the rewarding experience
*  and focusing on a different rewarding experience
*  that I think by definition is an extrinsic reward.
*  So we are taking ourselves out of our
*  intrinsically rewarding experiences
*  and activating these extrinsic rewards.
*  And do you think in any way that's undermining
*  our experience of things that we really enjoy?
*  Again, not to demonize social media or these channels,
*  but I've personally found it difficult to refrain
*  from sharing this knowledge that I'm so excited to share,
*  but I deliberately delay.
*  And I have a deep list of folders full of things
*  that I wanna post, but I'm just doing it systematically
*  over time because I really fight the temptation to do this,
*  mostly because I want to continue to enjoy
*  this learning process and this seeking process so much.
*  Yeah, I feel the same.
*  I feel torn.
*  I think it was E.B. White who said,
*  I rise in the morning torn between the desire
*  to enjoy the world and the desire to improve the world.
*  And this makes it difficult to plan the day.
*  And I feel that every day.
*  I think, I mean, I felt it this morning.
*  I was like, okay, it's time to leave
*  to come to the Huberman podcast.
*  I'm like, wait, but I didn't hit my minimum sunlight viewing.
*  What do I do?
*  Do I show up on time for you or do I meet your criteria?
*  The explanation, I was getting my morning sunlight
*  and therefore I'm X number of minutes or even hours late
*  would have been completely fine.
*  I figured as much.
*  Yes, absolutely.
*  That's a built in acceptable excuse with you.
*  I think everybody experiences a version of this
*  and it's definitely gotten worse with social media
*  and with smartphones.
*  I think, so one of the most startling data points for me
*  was Gloria Mark first put this on my radar.
*  Before COVID, the average person was checking email
*  72 times a day.
*  How do you ever concentrate for more than a couple minutes
*  if you're self interrupting that often?
*  You can't.
*  Brigitte Schulte has a great term for this.
*  She calls it time confetti.
*  And she says, we're taking these meaningful blocks of time
*  and we're slicing them up into these tiny little dots
*  of confetti and not only can we not accomplish anything,
*  we're also eroding our own sense of joy
*  because it's really hard to enjoy the 30 second blip
*  of time that you get on a task.
*  And I think we know a lot more about the existence
*  of these problems than how to solve them.
*  But one thing we do know is blocking out
*  on an interrupted time is meaningful.
*  There's a great Leslie Perlo experiment
*  where she takes engineers and she has them,
*  she sets a quiet time policy.
*  No interruptions Tuesday, Thursday, Friday before noon.
*  65% above average productivity.
*  Could you repeat the protocol again?
*  Yeah, so quiet time, there are a couple iterations of it,
*  but I think the most effective one was Tuesday,
*  Thursday, Friday, no meetings, no interruptions,
*  no Slack, no emails before noon.
*  And during those periods of no interruptions,
*  one could tend to whatever their primary purpose is at work.
*  Yeah, you have a-
*  So for me, it might be podcasting.
*  Obviously I don't have my phone in here, never do.
*  But it doesn't mean no interaction with anyone else.
*  It just means focusing on the major task.
*  The task, exactly.
*  And you come in with a clear sense of priority and purpose.
*  And I don't think there's anything magical
*  about Tuesday, Thursday, Friday before noon.
*  It's just the idea of setting a boundary
*  and collectively committing to it
*  that seems to be important.
*  And I think, when I think about this,
*  I'd be really curious about your take on chronotypes here.
*  Because I think one thing I've learned
*  in the last couple of years is that
*  if you're a morning person,
*  you do your best analytical and creative thinking
*  in the morning.
*  And so the quiet time block would work very well
*  for me as a morning person.
*  If you're a night owl,
*  you probably want that block in the late afternoon.
*  And I was encouraged,
*  there was some evidence during COVID
*  that people have their best meetings right after lunch.
*  That they're something like 30% less likely to multitask
*  in an after lunch meeting.
*  And I guess you could probably unpack the food coma,
*  getting re-energized by other people.
*  But it's led me to wonder if we should all be protecting
*  the first few hours and the last few hours of the day
*  for deep work.
*  And then doing our core meetings and interactions
*  and kind of off task activities in the middle.
*  What do you think about that as a sequence?
*  Yeah, well, I have a lot of questions about this for you,
*  but I love that sequence.
*  It certainly fits with my natural rhythms.
*  I think there's ample evidence to support the fact
*  that provided one is sleeping well at night
*  and is on a more or less a standard schedule.
*  When I say standard, I mean,
*  going to bed somewhere between,
*  let's say 9.30 and 11.30 PM,
*  waking up sometime between,
*  let's say 6.00 AM and 8.00 AM,
*  maybe 5.30 or 7.30, something like that.
*  So not highly unusual night owl or super early bird.
*  For people that are following that sort of schedule,
*  the first, let's just say from zero
*  to eight hours after waking,
*  there tends to be a fairly robust increase
*  in all the catecholamines,
*  so dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine,
*  which generally, okay, generally speaking,
*  lead to increases in alertness, attention and focus
*  that are great for analytic work,
*  great for implementation of strategies
*  that you already understand,
*  and you need to churn through a lot of stuff.
*  And of course, there's a big increase in the morning,
*  especially if you view morning sunlight,
*  a healthy increase, I should say, in cortisol.
*  Cortisol is not bad, folks.
*  You want cortisol,
*  but you want that peak early in the day.
*  We know that.
*  Okay, so for most people, it seems,
*  at least my understanding is that that period of time,
*  zero to eight hours after waking or so,
*  is best devoted to the quote unquote most critical tasks.
*  But one of the common problems is that people take
*  that ability to implement a known strategy
*  and they start battering back all the emails.
*  Or talking to all, by the way,
*  talking to coworkers is great and it's often required,
*  but the question is whether or not
*  it's a productive conversation
*  or whether or not it's just conversation.
*  And we tend to have a lot of energy early in the day.
*  And I'm obsessed with the idea of neural energy
*  as opposed to just caloric energy.
*  So there we're talking about neural energy.
*  And then post lunch, so really,
*  as we get to this sort of nine to 17 hours after waking,
*  there is a dip in autonomic arousal
*  that during the middle of the day, the postprandial dip,
*  there's a post lunch sleepiness
*  that can be partially offset
*  by delaying your morning caffeine a bit
*  if you have the afternoon crash.
*  But it's interesting that you know
*  that more productive meetings and less task switching
*  and distraction occurred in meetings after lunch
*  because that makes me think that perhaps
*  being a little bit less alert
*  is going to lend itself to more focus.
*  And indeed, that's the sort of optimal state,
*  relaxed but focused.
*  You're not sleepy,
*  but you also don't have so much intrinsic energy
*  that you're tending to a bunch of things
*  because I think a lot of people do feel that way.
*  I'm drinking double espresso right now,
*  late mid morning, late morning.
*  And I can sit still, but I think certain Zoom meetings,
*  how do I say this?
*  I don't wanna offend any of my colleagues.
*  They are boring enough.
*  They are not content rich enough to grab all my attention.
*  And nowadays, of course, there are multiple screens.
*  Typically, I've got two phones and a computer
*  and you have to really spend some work
*  to flip over those phones while I'm on a Zoom
*  and things like that.
*  Sorry, what were you saying?
*  I was listening.
*  So it's maybe the reduction in autonomic arousal
*  that supports what you just described, but I don't know.
*  My thinking, or my understanding rather,
*  was that creative work and kind of brainstorming
*  was best accomplished in the late afternoon.
*  I've noticed in lecturing,
*  I'd be curious what your experience is
*  in university lectures when I held courses in the evening.
*  I used to like to hold my courses five to seven p.m.
*  or even seven to 9.30 p.m.
*  when I was teaching undergraduates,
*  that people were much looser and more relaxed.
*  And I always thought that that might have something to do
*  with an increase in GABA transmission
*  that's known to happen in late evening.
*  That people are just kind of more relaxed
*  and less social anxiety.
*  They've been around people for much of the day.
*  Anyway, I send back more reflections than answers.
*  I don't have any firm neuroscience explanations
*  for what you described,
*  but there are some emerging theories
*  about how that might work.
*  And it has this zero to nine hours, phase one,
*  nine to 17 hours, phase two.
*  And then of course, from 17 to 24 hours,
*  I'll call it phase three, you should be asleep.
*  Yeah. Ideally.
*  Well, I think there's a confound
*  in your teaching experience,
*  which is undergrads often sleep in until what, noon?
*  True. Or they might be up until 4 a.m.
*  Or at least 10 a.m. seems to be a typical rise time
*  for the undergrad. Yes.
*  So a morning class might be too early
*  for them to be fully awake.
*  But there's some brand new evidence
*  that at least on creativity at work,
*  I read a series of, I think it was three studies recently,
*  showing that early birds actually did do more creative work
*  in the morning.
*  And in part, I think again,
*  I don't think any neuroscientist
*  has touched the mechanisms on this yet,
*  but in terms of the psychological processes,
*  early on, there seems to be a benefit of the energy level.
*  And some of that energy leads to more divergent thinking.
*  And later, if you're a morning person,
*  you might lose the ability to diverge quite as much.
*  And so you end up in a more conventional space of thought.
*  Does that track at all with your understanding
*  of how it might play out in the brain?
*  My understanding is it would be individual,
*  but there is something to these liminal states
*  between sleep and waking.
*  So maybe we can wrap a convenient bow
*  around what I said and what you just said,
*  which is that we know that in the transition states
*  into and out of sleep,
*  and it doesn't necessarily have to be
*  within the first half hour in and out of sleep,
*  that there seems to be more divergent thinking,
*  or at least activation of neural networks
*  that are not as constrained as one observes
*  when they're in a sheer task
*  and strategy implementation mode.
*  Right, I mean, I think-
*  Is that similar to the shower effect?
*  The shower effect.
*  So people have ideas in the shower or while running,
*  or while falling asleep,
*  or my best ideas always come within the first hour
*  after waking, that's why I carry a notebook around.
*  And much to the dismay of people in my life,
*  oftentimes I don't want to hear
*  or talk to anyone first thing in the morning.
*  This is problematic, and I had to make adjustments.
*  We'll talk about adjustments between productivity
*  and control and family interactions.
*  This is something I know you've worked on
*  and written about.
*  But those liminal states are interesting.
*  And I'd love your thoughts on this.
*  I've had several guests on this podcast
*  talk about their creative process, namely Rick Rubin.
*  He's famous for his work in music producing,
*  also has a great podcast, Tetragrammaton,
*  as well as Karl Deisseroth, a colleague of mine,
*  who's really in the .0001%
*  of super talented bioengineers, neuroscientists,
*  who also happens to be a full-time clinical psychiatrist
*  and has five children.
*  Okay.
*  And I asked them about their creative process,
*  because both of them are very creative.
*  Karl's process involves the following.
*  Late at night for him,
*  but it could really be any time of day,
*  deliberately making his body as still as possible
*  and forcing himself to think in complete sentences.
*  Rick's creative process,
*  although it includes a lot of different things,
*  has a lot to do with also getting very still, lying down.
*  Okay.
*  Other folks that I've spoken to, academics and artists,
*  have referred to getting their body into motion,
*  but quieting their mind.
*  So these are two opposite processes.
*  In one case, the body is still,
*  but the mind is deliberately very active.
*  In the other scenario, the body is very active,
*  but they're making their mind sort of in free association.
*  Not still, but they're not deliberately thinking
*  about any one thing.
*  Fascinating.
*  And I'm obsessed with this.
*  Maybe you and I could work on this.
*  You know, I'm due for a sabbatical.
*  Maybe we could figure this out, because I think-
*  I've never seen anyone study this before.
*  Right, because the nervous system, no.
*  The nervous system, I'm not aware of anyone
*  that's done it formally either.
*  The nervous system, of course,
*  is a brain-body phenomenon.
*  And so what happens when we sort of cut off
*  the deliberate operations of brain or body,
*  and it doesn't seem to matter whether or not
*  it's brain or body, as long as one is deliberately shut off.
*  And so anyway, I love your thoughts on this.
*  I don't consider myself like an ultra creative
*  or creative type to any great degree, but-
*  Me neither.
*  That's why I've been studying it.
*  Right, but I'm- Instead of doing it.
*  Right, but I'm fascinated by these deliberate tactics
*  that highly creative people have undertaken
*  in order to bring about ideas.
*  I certainly have some of my best ideas when I'm running,
*  and I'll just be running along like,
*  my goodness, I wasn't even thinking.
*  Now I need to write this down, okay, and then continue.
*  I tried the Diceroth approach and the Rubin approach,
*  actually just spent a week with Rick overseas.
*  And indeed, he spends a lot of time just still thinking.
*  And it's a very hard practice to get consistent with.
*  I wonder if there are individual differences here
*  on which needs to be stable or steady.
*  I'm thinking about, a huge part of creativity
*  is overriding your default instincts.
*  And if you're somebody whose default is
*  to have your mind constantly going,
*  then quieting would probably shift your train of thought
*  to something more original or unconventional.
*  The opposite might be true.
*  If you have a naturally quiet mind,
*  I would imagine you need to sort of jolt yourself out of that
*  with lots of access to free ranging thoughts.
*  And so it'd be interesting actually to study
*  whether we can predict what you should still
*  based on your personality.
*  Yeah, and maybe what we could do with that study,
*  I think we have a collaboration brewing.
*  There's a joke, two scientists walk into a room
*  and what comes out is a collaboration.
*  So I'd want to put people in a scanner.
*  It's hard to get people treadmilling in a scanner
*  because of movement artifact,
*  and just look at resting network activation
*  and compare that to resting network activation
*  when people are completely still
*  and forcing themselves to think in deliberate senses.
*  And then look at the overlap in that Venn diagram.
*  That's what's of interest to me.
*  They may be completely different brain states.
*  They might actually have more similarity than differences.
*  I wonder then if you can tie that to differences
*  in the quality and quantity of output.
*  So I would imagine that one of the benefits
*  of either kind of movement is that you end up increasing
*  the volume of ideas, which we know is good for variety
*  and ultimately increases the probability
*  that you stumble onto something new.
*  But then I think the being still part
*  is probably better for the filtering process.
*  I think one of the hardest parts of creativity
*  is actually judging your own ideas.
*  Most creative people have many terrible ideas.
*  In fact, the most creative people
*  have the most horrible ideas
*  because they just have a lot of ideas.
*  And I think that maybe there's a way in which quieting
*  either your body or your mind allows you to gain
*  some distance from the idea
*  and see whether it's boneheaded or promising.
*  I'd like to take a quick break
*  and thank our sponsor InsideTracker.
*  InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
*  that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
*  to help you better understand your body
*  and help you reach your health goals.
*  I've long been a believer
*  in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason
*  that many of the factors that impact your immediate
*  and long-term health can only be analyzed
*  from a quality blood test.
*  Now, a major problem with a lot of blood tests out there,
*  however, is that you get information back
*  about metabolic factors, lipids and hormones and so forth,
*  but you don't know what to do with that information.
*  With InsideTracker, they make it very easy
*  because they have a personalized platform
*  that allows you to see the levels of all those things,
*  metabolic factors, lipids, hormones, et cetera,
*  but it gives you specific directives that you can follow
*  that relate to nutrition, behavioral modification,
*  supplements, et cetera,
*  that can help you bring those numbers into the ranges
*  that are optimal for you.
*  If you'd like to try InsideTracker,
*  go to insidetracker.com slash Huberman.
*  As a Cyber Monday sale,
*  which will include Monday, November 27th
*  and Tuesday, November 28th,
*  InsideTracker is offering 50% off their full website.
*  Again, that's insidetracker.com slash Huberman.
*  Along those lines,
*  when one is trying to gauge the quality of their ideas,
*  how do you cope with,
*  or how does one cope with not placing a judge on that
*  that causes some false negatives
*  where you're wiping out great ideas?
*  Because Rick Rubin talks a lot about,
*  don't give the audience what they want.
*  They don't know what they want,
*  they haven't seen it yet.
*  If it's a truly creative idea, they haven't seen it.
*  But of course, we all have to develop our own sense of taste.
*  So, well, how does this process work for you?
*  I mean, you've written about
*  and worked on a tremendous range of topics
*  and always, I must say with such rigor
*  and such clarity of communication about those topics.
*  Yeah, it's absolutely true.
*  I mean, like 100%.
*  So we say around here, no weak sauce.
*  That's a great phrase.
*  There's no weak sauce in your game.
*  It's incredible.
*  So when do you get your ideas
*  and how do you filter those ideas?
*  I feel like the when could be anytime.
*  I think the, I mean, you've clearly experienced this too.
*  For me, the best thing about hosting a podcast
*  is I have an excuse to learn about anything I want
*  from almost anyone I want.
*  And I get to call that part of my job.
*  And so I feel like, you know,
*  that having that built-in mechanism for learning
*  means ideas could come at any moment.
*  The filtering process for me is,
*  it's evolved over the last few years.
*  What I do now is, let's say I'm starting a new book,
*  I'll write a draft of the first chapter
*  and I send it to five to eight people
*  whose judgment I trust.
*  And by design, some of those people are in my field.
*  They're deep-seated in organizational psychology.
*  Others are very far outside
*  but curious about the topics I'm interested in.
*  And I ask them for a zero to 10 score.
*  This is something I learned to do as a springboard diver
*  where I would take off and I'm doing a few flips or twists
*  and I think my dive is good but I can't see it
*  because I'm hurling in midair and everything's a blur.
*  And so I have to rely on my coach
*  to tell me if it was any good.
*  I feel like creative work is the same way.
*  You're too close to it to know
*  how the audience is gonna react to it.
*  And yes, you don't wanna create it just for the audience
*  but at the end of the day, you want it to be interesting
*  or useful to them.
*  So I asked for the zero to 10 and no one ever says 10
*  and then I use that as a calibration mechanism.
*  So if everybody's in the seven or eight range,
*  I know that I'm onto something promising
*  and now I need to refine it.
*  If I get a bunch of twos, threes, three and a halves,
*  I either need to rethink the idea
*  or dramatically rewrite how I'm positioning it.
*  And I think one of the mistakes a lot of people make is
*  they know they need feedback on their ideas.
*  They go to one or two people
*  and they start to feel a little bit defensive or threatened
*  and their ego gets involved
*  and then they don't ask for any more.
*  What they don't realize is it's actually less painful
*  if you get more feedback.
*  Because when eight different people critique your work,
*  you start to realize that a few of the comments
*  that sort of bruise you a little bit
*  were just idiosyncratic
*  and no one else cared about those issues.
*  But then five people had the same problem.
*  That is not taste, that is a quality issue
*  and I've got to focus on that.
*  And so it really helps to filter
*  what are the revisions I need to make?
*  What are the problems and complaints
*  I need to pay attention to?
*  Versus what can I ignore?
*  Because maybe this product was not for that person.
*  I'm recalling when I was a postdoc,
*  I had a manuscript fully prepared
*  and I worked in a laboratory where I didn't work
*  on the same thing as my postdoc advisor.
*  He was very gracious in letting me be the outlier.
*  And he said, well, I don't know anything about this topic
*  so before you submit it to this very prestigious journal,
*  I'll be honest, you should probably go down the hall
*  and hand it to so and so.
*  I don't want to mention who it was
*  because I'm still in the same department.
*  And I gave it to him, this individual,
*  and he looked at it and he said,
*  yeah, it looks interesting
*  but I don't think there's going to be
*  a whole lot of interest in this.
*  It's just like not.
*  I was like, no way, I think this is really cool.
*  But I was pretty dismayed.
*  So I was like, oh gosh, so what do I do?
*  So I went back to my advisor
*  and thankfully he's a bit of an iconoclast
*  and he said, that's the best feedback you could have gotten.
*  Definitely submit it to that particular journal.
*  And I must say that paper got accepted faster
*  than any other paper.
*  I've never had an experience like that.
*  I mean, it required some revisions.
*  I remember thinking like, wow, what an unusual response
*  to after having instructed me to go ask
*  a more senior colleague, right?
*  He was at that time assistant professor.
*  And then to get the essentially negative response
*  and then to take that as like,
*  you should definitely send it out.
*  Really taught me a lesson that sometimes one needs
*  to invert their action according
*  to the negative feedback they get.
*  Not always, but that was an N of one.
*  Okay, so it's not, shouldn't be extrapolated
*  to too many circumstances.
*  But basically led me to not seek out feedback
*  prior to submission of things terribly often.
*  I mean, I check information obviously prior to podcasts.
*  I check the validity of the information
*  in podcasts and papers.
*  But it made me realize that people's opinions
*  can be like highly idiosyncratic
*  and in some cases outright wrong.
*  And really the opinion of the journal
*  is what mattered most in terms of getting it accepted or not.
*  So how do you, you said give it to the greatest number
*  of people, but if it's anything like comments
*  on social media, there's a salience to negative comments.
*  So how should we filter positive versus negative feedback?
*  Well, there's a meta analysis here.
*  This is Kluger and Denisi looking at 100 years
*  of feedback research.
*  And they found that what drives the utility of feedback
*  is not whether it's positive or negative.
*  It's whether it focuses on the task or on the self.
*  So if I tell you that your work is terrible,
*  you're gonna get defensive.
*  If I tell you that your work is great,
*  you're gonna get complacent.
*  If I tell you here's the specific thing
*  that I liked about your work,
*  you're gonna try to learn to repeat that.
*  And if I tell you here's the thing I didn't like,
*  you're gonna try to see if you can fix it.
*  So I actually think we should worry less
*  about whether the feedback is encouraging or discouraging
*  and more about how do I make sure that I get input
*  that's gonna allow me to learn from my strengths
*  and also overcome my weaknesses.
*  And actually one of the things I've learned recently
*  is there's some, I would say a growing body of evidence
*  at this point that asking for feedback
*  is not the best way to get people to help you.
*  Because when you ask for feedback,
*  you end up getting two groups of people.
*  You get cheerleaders and you get critics.
*  And cheerleaders are basically applauding your best self.
*  Critics are attacking your worst self.
*  What you want is a coach,
*  which is somebody who helps you become
*  a better version of yourself.
*  And the way you get people to coach you
*  is not to say give me feedback
*  because they will then look at the past
*  and tell you what you screwed up or what you did right.
*  What you want is to say,
*  can you give me advice for next time?
*  And then they look at the future
*  and they'll give you either a note on something to repeat
*  or something to correct.
*  And this is such a subtle shift
*  but it can make a big difference.
*  Andrew, one of the things I've,
*  I guess I found myself applying this to a lot is
*  after giving speeches.
*  I used to get off stage and say, I would love some feedback.
*  And you get back a bunch of,
*  oh, you know, I really enjoyed that.
*  Thanks, what do I do with that information?
*  I'm trying to learn how to get better.
*  And when I shift the question to say,
*  what's the one thing I could do better next time?
*  It's like, oh, don't open with a joke.
*  The audience couldn't tell you were joking.
*  Frequently it's, give me a little bit more of a through line.
*  You focused a lot on a bunch of interesting points
*  but I lost the connective tissue.
*  And those actionable suggestions are much more likely to come
*  when you just ask for a tip as opposed to an evaluation.
*  Oh, that's so good.
*  I'm going to just pause for a second.
*  I've never taken a pause.
*  I've taken occasional pause to be honest
*  but they're very rare as the audience knows.
*  Oh, that's just gazillion dollar advice
*  because I think that everyone has an ego.
*  We all want to perform well.
*  We'd like to perform better over time
*  and negative feedback hurts.
*  And it can hurt a little or a lot
*  depending on how defensive we are
*  but a tool like you just described
*  to remove some of that defensive armor that we all have
*  and actually let the information in
*  in a way that's constructive is really great.
*  What you described I think is a way
*  to create constructive criticism
*  but the constructive part is really coming from within
*  as opposed to saying I'd like some constructive criticism
*  and then hoping that the criticism is actually constructive.
*  So you're taking control over the process
*  in a healthy way, in a benevolent way.
*  That's the goal.
*  The big question that comes up for a lot of people
*  at this point is okay, so I get somebody to give me advice
*  but it might still sting.
*  How do I get better at taking it constructively?
*  And I think probably my favorite technique on this
*  I learned from Sheila Heen, she calls it the second score.
*  And the idea is that when somebody gives you
*  a piece of criticism, that's your first score.
*  So let's say in my world they gave me a three and a half
*  and I want to know how I can do better next time.
*  How do I get myself to focus on that?
*  What I do is say I want to get a 10
*  for how well I took the three and a half.
*  And that's the second score.
*  I want to evaluate myself on how well I took the first score.
*  I think about this almost every day.
*  There was, actually can I tell you a quick story?
*  So when I was right out of my doctorate
*  I got asked to teach a motivation class
*  for Air Force generals and colonels.
*  I was 25, I think, 25, 26.
*  You know, they're all twice my age.
*  They've got thousands of flying hours.
*  They've got billion dollar budgets.
*  They've got, well, you know this community well.
*  Their nicknames are Stryker and Sand Dune.
*  And I was extremely intimidated.
*  So I walked in there and I thought I had to impress them.
*  And I started talking about my credentials
*  and all my research experience.
*  And the feedback at the end of the four hour session
*  was brutal.
*  I remember reading the feedback forums
*  and one person had written,
*  more knowledge in the audience than on the podium.
*  I was like, true.
*  I can't argue with that.
*  And then another wrote, I gained nothing from this session
*  but I trust the instructor gained useful insight.
*  And that was devastating.
*  I was like, can I, I would really like to transform
*  into an actual bear and hibernate for the next four months.
*  And then maybe I'll come out of a hole ready to hear this.
*  I didn't have that option.
*  I had committed to teach a second session a week later.
*  So all I could do was figure out
*  how am I gonna hear this feedback
*  and really take it seriously.
*  And I guess I applied a version of the second score
*  and I said, all right, there's some generals
*  that are gonna come back and see me again.
*  And I've got to prove to them that I was open to feedback.
*  And one of the things I heard loud and clear was that
*  they valued humility.
*  And I had led with too much confidence
*  which was just insecurity masked.
*  And so I thought, okay, how do I change the equation?
*  And walked in, looked at the room and I said,
*  I know what you're all thinking right now.
*  What could I possibly learn from a professor
*  who's 12 years old?
*  Dead silence.
*  Oh no, this is gonna go horribly wrong.
*  And then one of the guys in the audience jumps in
*  and he's like, oh, that's ridiculous.
*  You gotta be at least 13.
*  Everybody started laughing.
*  It broke the ice.
*  And I think what I was trying to do
*  was to take myself off the pedestal
*  and say, look, I heard your feedback.
*  You told me that you didn't think I had anything
*  to teach you and I've got to acknowledge that right up front
*  and be open to the fact that that's true.
*  And so I wanna come in here and learn from you
*  and I wanna see if I can curate a conversation
*  where we all end up learning.
*  And the feedback was night and day different.
*  Afterward, one person wrote, although junior in experience,
*  the professor dealt with the evidence in an interesting way.
*  All right, I'll take it.
*  And there's something really powerful about saying,
*  look, I can't change the fact that they hated my session.
*  What I can do is convince them that I was motivated
*  to learn from their criticism.
*  I love this concept of the second score
*  and thank you for sharing that story.
*  I think very often we hear about people like you
*  who if people didn't catch the math in there,
*  you were a PhD by age 25.
*  And as far as I know,
*  the youngest tenured professor at Penn at 28.
*  So these are outrageously impressive
*  metrics of accomplishment.
*  But for you to share a story
*  about less than optimal performance
*  and how you adjusted to it
*  and the incorporation of the second score
*  that you're referring to,
*  I think is really appreciated
*  because I think that as much as we hear,
*  Jordan took many more free throws
*  and everyone just thinks about all the ones he made.
*  People think about all the ones he made.
*  That's the way the game works.
*  That's the way the mind works, I should say.
*  So I appreciate that you've fleshed it out
*  with a personal example.
*  I too would want to turn into a bear and disappear.
*  But I think that it's really impressive what you did.
*  And it makes me think that the second score
*  of getting a ten at bringing the three and a half up,
*  right, as it were,
*  is really about turning a score into a verb process.
*  Over and over again, as I do this podcast
*  and as I've taught in the classroom,
*  what I keep coming back to is this idea
*  that we should be focusing more on verbs and less on nouns.
*  We love to name things and categorize them.
*  But when we start living life
*  through a lot of verb processes,
*  so instead of being fit,
*  or running as a thing,
*  we really think about just running.
*  It becomes less daunting and we accomplish far more.
*  But the idea that,
*  there are mathematical models of this, I'm sure,
*  but where you're basically talking about an integral,
*  as opposed to just some value.
*  Where you're talking about the slope of the line.
*  So you're a three and a half.
*  How are you gonna get to a ten?
*  Gosh, that's a huge gap.
*  And you're dealing with being back on your heels
*  psychologically from getting all this battering feedback
*  from these highly accomplished individuals,
*  all these accoutrements,
*  literally wearing them, presumably, on their body,
*  so you can see.
*  And it's really about creating,
*  it's about taking control of the slope of that line
*  from the three onward.
*  And it's really a forward-looking perspective.
*  So I don't think we're being
*  unduly psychological here, or analytic.
*  I mean, I think it's really about taking a moment state
*  and a noun and turning it into a verb.
*  Yeah, I think that's right.
*  I'm reminded of the great philosopher Homer Simpson,
*  who said that verbing weirds language.
*  So it's harder to talk about this stuff in verbs.
*  I swear I didn't steal it from the Simpsons,
*  but if it came from Homer Simpson, I'm all for it.
*  You have to, I mean, that's-
*  Small brain, small brain,
*  but given the size of his brain,
*  and people have seen the image,
*  fairly robust knowledge.
*  No, I think you're onto something.
*  I think verbs are active, and we're drawn to them.
*  I think, yeah, a lot of times,
*  people review their past work,
*  and they just end up shaming an earlier version
*  of themselves, and they wallow in rumination.
*  And what we wanna try to do in that situation,
*  which is easier said than done, is to say,
*  all right, the purpose of getting feedback or advice
*  is not to shame my past self, it's to educate my future self.
*  Which I think is very connected to a lot of the work
*  on growth mindset that you've been talking about.
*  And there's been a firestorm of controversy
*  around can we teach growth mindset in schools lately?
*  And I think what that has underscored for me is,
*  look, you can't expect someone to listen
*  to one podcast episode, or go through one workshop,
*  and magically believe that they're capable
*  of learning anything at any moment.
*  This is something we have to actively work on
*  on a daily basis, and part of doing that,
*  exactly as you said, is thinking about this loop,
*  and saying, all right, the person that I'm competing with
*  is my past self, and I wanna get a little bit better today
*  than I was yesterday.
*  Yeah, I think along the lines of growth mindset,
*  obviously we both know Carol Dweck,
*  and I respect her tremendously,
*  and I realize there is some controversy now
*  around how readily one can teach growth mindset
*  or incorporate growth mindset.
*  My understanding, and I'd love to know your thoughts
*  on this, is that when the Dweck work is combined
*  with some of the Ali Crum work, that is,
*  growth mindset is combined with a knowledge,
*  just a basic and true understanding that stress
*  and the feelings of anxiety and tension,
*  that can actually be performance enhancing.
*  When those two things are combined,
*  I think this is the work of David Yeager
*  and colleagues at UT Austin, that indeed growth mindset
*  becomes more visible in our mindsets and performance.
*  And are there other aspects to growth mindset
*  and other mindsets that are now being woven
*  into that framework that can be helpful?
*  Because I know, gosh, if ever there was a great name
*  for a area of psychology growth mindset,
*  it tells you everything you want,
*  everything you need, and everything you need to know
*  in just the name, but we all find it difficult to implement.
*  Just telling myself I'm not as good as something
*  as I could be yet, it sounds great,
*  but in moments of receiving feedback that's harsh,
*  sometimes it's hard to access.
*  Yeah, it is.
*  I think the latest, there's a McNamara et al meta-analysis,
*  and then I think that camp versus the Carol and David camp
*  have very different views on how big the effects are,
*  but I think one thing they seem to agree on
*  is growth mindset is more important in circumstances
*  where people are more likely to need it.
*  So if you think about, for example,
*  kids who are impoverished or marginalized communities,
*  the message that you are capable of,
*  of evolving your skills to the point
*  that something you're bad at today,
*  you could be good at next year,
*  is really important when you've never heard that before,
*  and when you don't have a single person believing in you.
*  I think where we're often missing the boat is we think,
*  all right, I'm just gonna instill this idea
*  in a person's head, and my work is done.
*  And we know that the context around you really matters.
*  So actually, Carol's done some research showing
*  that growth mindset is more likely to have an impact
*  when your classroom culture also, and your teacher,
*  has the belief that kids are capable
*  of learning and growing,
*  that your starting ability is not fixed in any subject.
*  And I think probably for all of us as individuals,
*  what that means is we need to think about
*  the micro environment that we put ourselves in.
*  I guess one of the things I've been thinking a lot about
*  lately is scaffolding, and the idea that
*  when you're trying to improve at something,
*  you don't need a permanent teacher necessarily.
*  You don't need one mentor guiding you for nine years.
*  What you need is somebody who can give you
*  the temporary support that allows you to scale
*  to a new height, just like a scaffold would on a building.
*  And in learning theory, basically the idea behind
*  scaffolding is we're gonna initially give you
*  the support you need to solve a problem,
*  and then we're gonna slowly remove the support
*  so that you learn to do it on your own.
*  And I think that those kinds of scaffolds
*  are often missing, so we instill the growth mindset,
*  I've got this belief in my head,
*  but I don't know what I need to do
*  to put that belief into action.
*  And that's where, I guess that to me is,
*  we have to go beyond mindset.
*  We have to think about how do we put people in a context
*  that allows them to put their beliefs into practice?
*  You were asking me, what else do we need
*  to support growth mindset and make it effective, right?
*  Yeah, I mean, we know people learn what growth mindset is.
*  It's the idea that you're not as good at something yet.
*  Okay, terrific, but it's very hard to implement
*  in real time.
*  There are, I have to presume, additional tools
*  that one can bolster the growth mindset with,
*  make it more accessible and benefit from it.
*  Yes, so Justin Berg and Amy Resnetsky
*  and I studied this actually.
*  We were looking at growth mindset at work.
*  And Justin's, well, he's at Stanford.
*  I don't know if you've met him yet.
*  I have not, but big place.
*  Yes, I figured as much.
*  He'll be on the list soon if I, yep.
*  Brilliant creativity researcher,
*  and Amy just joined us at Wharton
*  and has fundamentally changed the way
*  that I think about ideas in the way that she studied
*  how we can shape our context
*  and just done pathbreaking work there.
*  And we were interested in growth mindset
*  and we designed an intervention
*  where people could learn growth mindset at work.
*  So we taught them to think about
*  how their skills were malleable,
*  how they could stretch their knowledge into new areas.
*  And we found that teaching them that was not enough
*  to boost their happiness or their performance.
*  What we needed to also do was give them a growth mindset,
*  not just about themselves, but also about their jobs.
*  In other words, to teach them that your job
*  is a set of flexible building blocks,
*  that you've got a whole bunch of tasks that make up your job.
*  Some of those are things to do.
*  Others might be interactions that you need to have.
*  And if you break down your job into all these tasks,
*  you might have some tasks that you want to accentuate
*  and make a bigger part of your job.
*  Others that you want to try to subtract.
*  Others that you might swap with a colleague.
*  And a lot of people, it turns out,
*  think their jobs are fixed by their job descriptions,
*  but in fact, you have a ton of opportunity to say,
*  wait a minute, there's a strength I have,
*  but I'm not using it right now.
*  Is there a way we can bring that into my work?
*  And so in these couple of experiments we did,
*  when we randomly assigned people to learn
*  both that their jobs were malleable
*  and that their skills were malleable,
*  they got a sustainable boost to their happiness
*  that lasted at least six months.
*  There was no cost to their performance,
*  meaning you could redesign your own job
*  to be more enjoyable without a drop
*  in the effectiveness of your contributions to your workplace.
*  And I think what I came away from that research realizing
*  is it's not enough to just say,
*  well, I can get better, I can improve,
*  because very often you feel like your environment is limited.
*  I'm like, great, yeah, I can grow,
*  but I'm stuck in a dead end job.
*  And so what we need to do there is open up the opportunity
*  for people to innovate on their own job description,
*  and then the growth mindset can begin to have an impact.
*  I love it.
*  It sounds a bit like adding a S to growth mindset.
*  So it's not growth mindset, it's growth mindsets.
*  Because earlier you mentioned that
*  in the classroom environment,
*  if the teacher adopts a growth mindset,
*  as well as the students,
*  well, then you have a culture of growth mindset.
*  So it's the interconnectedness of this
*  and the context in which the individual's
*  growth mindset exists.
*  Do I have that right?
*  Well put, yeah, we ended up calling it dual mindset,
*  but I think making it a plural is good,
*  because I have this image of,
*  you put a person in a cage
*  and then tell them they're capable of growing.
*  Still stuck in a cage.
*  And so we need to give them a chance
*  to bust through those walls.
*  Super important.
*  I hate to take us back to an earlier topic,
*  but there's something that I meant to ask you
*  that I didn't, and I'm absolutely needing to ask you.
*  Which is your recent work or recent-ish work,
*  it was a few years back now,
*  and you're so prolific that I have to call it
*  a few years back.
*  The relationship between intrinsic motivation
*  and performance on other tasks.
*  Yeah, and the reason I asked this is several fold.
*  I did two episodes of the podcast on ADHD.
*  And one of the things that I learned
*  in talking to experts on ADHD,
*  people with ADHD, as well as looking at some of the
*  novel treatments, everything from behavioral
*  to prescription drug to even nutrition-based,
*  was that kids and adults with clinically diagnosed ADHD
*  are actually terrific at paying attention
*  to things that they really enjoy,
*  or that they're super interested in.
*  So clearly they have the capacity.
*  It's just that they have deficits, if you will,
*  in attending to things that are less exciting to them,
*  less intriguing to them.
*  So if I recall correctly, you have a publication
*  that explored the relationship between intrinsic motivation
*  and performance in other stuff.
*  And one of the major conclusions was that having
*  a deep, deep interest in one thing
*  might not be the best condition for performing well
*  at other, less interesting tasks.
*  Could you tell us about that study?
*  What motivated you to carry out that study
*  and what some of the major takeaways were?
*  Yeah, definitely.
*  You summarized it really well.
*  I think the original impetus,
*  so this was another project with Jihei Shen,
*  and Jihei came to me wanting to study intrinsic motivation.
*  And we were talking about,
*  what do we know about intrinsic motivation
*  and what are the gaps in our knowledge?
*  And one thing that has always bothered me
*  is when psychologists study something that sounds positive
*  and they only study the benefits of it.
*  I'm like, there's no such thing as an unmitigated good.
*  All sort of enjoyable experiences have costs.
*  All unpleasant experiences can have benefits.
*  We need to fill out this two by two of good thing, bad thing,
*  good outcome, bad outcome.
*  And so my challenge to her was,
*  can you show me the dark side of intrinsic motivation?
*  And she came back and she said,
*  what if there's a cost of loving a task,
*  leading you to hate a task that you don't like
*  even more than you did before?
*  I was like, oh, that's an interesting idea.
*  Tracks with the basic psychology of contrast effects,
*  where if you eat something delicious,
*  then your least favorite food
*  tastes a little bit worse afterward.
*  And so I said, let's study this.
*  So she ended up getting data from people at work.
*  And then we also designed an experiment and sure enough,
*  the more passionate you are on task one,
*  the more your performance suffers
*  if task two is really boring.
*  And I guess what this did for me
*  is it made me think differently about task sequencing.
*  I used to wake up in the morning
*  and do my most interesting task first.
*  And then the grading was hell.
*  And what I do now is I start
*  with a moderately interesting task.
*  It's a little bit of a warmup for me.
*  And then I have an exciting one to look forward to.
*  And if I do have a task that's boring but important,
*  I think the performance is gonna suffer less.
*  Interesting.
*  I normally don't ask about morning routines
*  and how one structures their day
*  because it's highly individual.
*  Completely agree.
*  Yeah, and it depends on whether or not people have kids
*  and they're pets and you know, what other,
*  but I'll just share with you a brief anecdote.
*  I have a friend who's a very accomplished musician.
*  It has been for several decades now.
*  And he told me that he has a practice of
*  after he gets off stage and he's like stadium,
*  stadium sellout level musician.
*  Has been for a long time and shows no signs of stopping.
*  Just incredible, but a very down to earth person.
*  And he said, one of the first things he does
*  when he gets off stage is to go do some menial task.
*  I thought there's no way that's true,
*  but I've known his wife since college
*  and she verified that statement.
*  I was like, what sorts of menial tasks are you talking about?
*  He's like, oh, like cleaning up some of the cans
*  and things that are there.
*  Maybe even cleaning a toilet at a venue.
*  And I thought, no chance, but it turns out to be true.
*  And I said, what's this about?
*  Is this about humility?
*  He said, well, maybe a little bit,
*  but he said it actually makes it a lot easier
*  for him to return home and deal with the kind of little
*  things that just are out of scale
*  with the experiences that he just had.
*  He's tapering, okay.
*  I think.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  First of all, I was so struck by the fact
*  that he had created this process for himself so long ago.
*  And he's also somebody who's maintained,
*  he's been in the same marriage for an extremely long time.
*  He's extremely happy in that as family.
*  I mean, one of these people that seems to thrive
*  in all domains of life,
*  and I'm certain that he struggles in some domain of life
*  because everybody does,
*  but it sounds to me like a very unusual practice,
*  but it seems to kind of relate to this,
*  that he has this thing that he loves doing,
*  playing music and performing in particular.
*  And he's just 0.01% at doing that.
*  But then just like bring himself back down to earth
*  because so much of life and especially family life
*  is like dealing with the schmutz
*  and the inconvenience of everyday life.
*  Yeah, it actually sounds like what he's doing
*  is he's resetting his frame of reference to say,
*  if I go right home, then the contrast
*  between this high octane experience I'm having
*  and sort of muddling through everyday life
*  is gonna be extreme.
*  If I do something really small,
*  then family time is gonna seem a lot bigger.
*  Yeah, so I realize that I'm taking a bit of a leap
*  from your study on intrinsic motivation
*  and low performance in other domains.
*  But to me, cleaning a toilet is,
*  it's boring for all the wrong reasons, right?
*  As you say.
*  You do not want that to be an exciting task.
*  No, and listen, I mean, if I had to do it for a living,
*  I would, right?
*  And I would try and do it as well as possible.
*  But right, so well, I found that study
*  to be particularly interesting
*  because I think that these days,
*  we glorify high performance,
*  even quote unquote peak performance,
*  something we can talk about.
*  And we forget that, yes, oftentimes people
*  who are ultra high performers can afford
*  to pay other people to do all the other stuff.
*  But I have to say in knowing some ultra high performers
*  and in knowing some people in the billionaire bracket,
*  you know, there's a high incidence of mental health issues,
*  frankly, and lack of satisfaction with life
*  that maybe even comes from not having to do anything
*  besides the things that you find
*  most intrinsically rewarding.
*  We all think that, oh, if I could,
*  I would spend all day doing the things
*  that I find most intrinsically rewarding.
*  But maybe there's something about this push-pull.
*  We know the brain works in push-pull with almost everything
*  that having some experiences each day
*  that are kind of like, oh, this thing again.
*  Do you think that heightens our level of satisfaction
*  for the things we really enjoy?
*  I would be surprised if it didn't.
*  I think contrast effects are very powerful.
*  And we know, I mean, there's half a century
*  of research on happiness suggesting
*  that the comparisons we make are what matter.
*  I think Tim Urban probably put it best
*  when he said happiness is reality minus expectations.
*  And if you only have enjoyable experiences,
*  your expectations are rising into perpetuity.
*  So it doesn't matter how good your reality is,
*  you wanted it to be better and better.
*  I think one of the things
*  that mundane experiences manage to do for us,
*  or maybe a better way to say it is,
*  I think one of the benefits of mundane experiences
*  they keep our expectations on the ground
*  and allow us to be pleasantly surprised
*  by a task that was more interesting than we expected,
*  even though we didn't love it.
*  What are your thoughts on what I call momentum,
*  which is when I have an experience
*  that I particularly like, like if we record a podcast
*  and I'm really excited to get it out into the world,
*  or if I have some experience that I'm left
*  very excited by at the end, that oftentimes the energy,
*  again, I'm obsessed with this concept of neural energy,
*  the energy that I gleaned from that experience
*  seems to have carryover into other things.
*  You know, I'm gonna be much more excited
*  to just go across the street and get a cup of coffee.
*  Feels like a bigger thing than it normally would.
*  And I would think that one could kind of ride the wake
*  of a prior accomplishment,
*  even a small accomplishment each day,
*  and make the tidying up or doing things
*  that one would normally find more boring, less boring.
*  Is that true?
*  The way you're describing contrast effects
*  makes it seem like it's more of a cliff.
*  Like that thing was great and now this thing.
*  But I also can kind of ride high on something
*  that happened two, three days ago,
*  maybe even two, three months ago.
*  So feeling good equates to feeling good,
*  or feeling good accentuates the bad stuff.
*  This is the tension between contrast and spillover.
*  And you can see both under different conditions.
*  I think this is a brand new sort of,
*  I don't think anybody's reconciled
*  those two perspectives yet,
*  but my hunch from having worked on the contrast part of it
*  is we found that it was only extreme intrinsic motivation
*  that had the performance cost on other tasks.
*  So if you're enjoying something, if you like it,
*  that will give you a lift for other tasks.
*  It's where this is the best thing you've ever done,
*  and now other things suck by comparison.
*  That's where we start to see you run into a problem.
*  I also wonder if there's a domain switching effect here.
*  I think you're alluding to this.
*  I read some research that just came out this year
*  showing that one of the benefits,
*  one of the surprising benefits of morning workouts
*  is you actually have more confidence in your job,
*  because you get that small win.
*  Like, I accomplished something this morning,
*  and that gives you a sense of efficacy
*  that you can carry over into the start of your workday.
*  Not to suggest that everyone should work out in the morning,
*  because I'm with you.
*  I think everybody should both work and work out
*  at a time that works for them.
*  But I think there's something to be said for,
*  something went really well in one realm of my life,
*  and that boosts my belief and my capability
*  to tackle challenges in a different realm.
*  What about in the opposite direction?
*  You were a competitive diver.
*  I have to presume that there were days
*  when you had lousy dives.
*  It must have been that one day.
*  Felt like every day.
*  And then you leave, you shower up, dry off,
*  head into the rest of your day.
*  And how do we segment away from the negative thought spirals
*  of like, something went really poorly,
*  and now you're off into the domain of life
*  where you know how to do the things
*  that you're required to do,
*  but maybe there's some challenge
*  and some learning involved.
*  How do we cut moats between negative experiences?
*  I think, I mean, the Ted Lasso strategy is ideal.
*  Become a goldfish, 10-second memory,
*  and then you don't even recall
*  the practice you had earlier today.
*  I think that I don't know anybody
*  who can do that consistently.
*  And I think the more disappointing the experience is,
*  the more you tend to dwell on it.
*  I think when you talk about segmenting negative experiences,
*  I think probably the research that I've liked best on this,
*  and I just wanna make sure I capture this clearly.
*  I basically, so research on emotion regulation says
*  there are two strategies that tend to be effective.
*  One is distraction, the other is reframing.
*  So distraction is, find something else
*  that will consume your attention
*  that's unrelated to the thing that you just bombed at.
*  And the hope is that that fades into the background.
*  Reframing is a lot of what you were talking about
*  a few minutes ago, which is, okay, let me focus
*  not on the level of my performance, but the slope.
*  My diving coach, Eric Best,
*  has a really great set of questions that he asks.
*  And I remember I finished practice,
*  I'm like, this is a terrible day.
*  I just feel like I'm worthless as a diver,
*  and now diving was a big part of my identity.
*  I'm gonna let my team down, now I'm a bad teammate too.
*  My coach is wasting his time,
*  and now he could have been training somebody much better.
*  Why am I doing this?
*  And Eric would ask, did you make yourself better today?
*  And even if it was a bad practice,
*  there is something that improved.
*  Yes, okay.
*  And sometimes the answer feels like no,
*  and then he would ask,
*  did you make someone else better today?
*  Like, yeah, I gave a little tip to a teammate.
*  You know, I made a joke that made everybody laugh,
*  and he was like, great, then it wasn't a bad day.
*  And I think this is an example
*  of what good reframing looks like,
*  to say, okay, the goal wasn't to be great,
*  it was to be better.
*  The goal wasn't necessarily just to make myself better,
*  it was also to make other people better.
*  And I think those are the kinds of questions
*  that seem to segment pretty well.
*  I love that feedback,
*  because I think we all get stuck in those thought spirals.
*  And again, not to demonize smartphones,
*  because they are wonderful tools,
*  but I have to remember the time I'm 48 years old,
*  as of tomorrow, and I have to remember a time
*  in which negative stuff was probably happening
*  in the background, but I didn't hear about it,
*  because no one was texting it to me.
*  So I'd find out at the end of the day,
*  when I still had time to do other things in the meantime.
*  That said, I would also get negative experiences
*  early in the day, and then carry them
*  throughout the entire day,
*  when nowadays you can get a positive text message
*  that says, okay, it wasn't so bad,
*  or something like that.
*  But I do think, as is probably becoming apparent
*  about these channels of communication
*  are either boons or disruptions to our positive psychology.
*  It's clear that we're just being bombarded all the time.
*  So just as a practical question,
*  what is your relationship to your phone?
*  Do you set boundaries around your phone use?
*  Were the types of communications and activities
*  that you engage with on your phone?
*  I do.
*  So I think everyone I know has a to-do list.
*  I also have a to-don't list.
*  And on my to-don't list includes,
*  I don't scroll on social media,
*  and I don't pick up my phone past nine p.m.
*  And those two habits are enormously helpful,
*  particularly the not scrolling.
*  I pick up my phone when I have something to post,
*  or when I wanna see what the comments are,
*  and then see if there's something interesting to learn,
*  or somebody that I wanna respond to.
*  And that becomes a really healthy boundary,
*  because I don't get stuck in one of these rabbit holes,
*  where all of a sudden two hours have gone by,
*  and I feel like I wasted my time.
*  But where do you post or keep your to-do
*  and your to-don't list?
*  Do you keep them on your phone?
*  No, it's a Word document on my computer.
*  Okay, so you're still at the computer screen
*  quite a bit each day.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  I feel like that's where most of my good thinking
*  and writing happens.
*  Yeah, I carry a small notebook around with me now,
*  and write things down.
*  I was just curious.
*  Like one of these?
*  Yeah, well like one of those, yeah.
*  Yeah, I try not to take notes on my phone ever.
*  Right.
*  Yeah, it can be problematic for me,
*  especially with voice recognition now,
*  because it's hard to go back to that
*  in a systematic way for me,
*  but I'm a big believer in these things.
*  But for those listening and not watching,
*  I'm holding up a pen.
*  So pencils work too.
*  You've probably read some of the research also showing
*  that you have a better memory for information
*  when you take notes by hand than by keyboard.
*  I didn't know that,
*  but I'm very, very gratified to hear that.
*  And I suppose if you don't have a pen
*  and you don't have a pencil handy,
*  then blood always works.
*  Just kidding, I'm just kidding.
*  Don't make yourself or anyone else bleed
*  just to get an idea down.
*  But it is amazing how sometimes we will have ideas
*  while running, walking, showering out and about,
*  and then later try and recall those ideas.
*  And if we don't write them down, they're gone.
*  The great Joe Strummer from The Clash
*  talked about the critical importance
*  of carrying around a small notebook such as you did,
*  because he said that the ideas fall down like rain,
*  and if you catch them, they're there,
*  but if you miss them, they truly won't be there later.
*  And there's something kind of eerie about that.
*  Like why wouldn't we be able to remember
*  these potential gems of ideas?
*  All right, the geysering up of the mind.
*  We had a guest on this podcast for a series,
*  Dr. Paul Conti, psychiatrist,
*  and he talked extensively about the unconscious mind.
*  I mentioned this a little earlier,
*  but one of the things that really stuck with me is he said,
*  everyone thinks that the prefrontal cortex
*  and the frontal cortex is the supercomputer
*  of the human brain.
*  Sets context, planning strategy, switching, et cetera,
*  et cetera.
*  Certainly it's valuable real estate to our intellect
*  and all our abilities, but he said,
*  the real supercomputer is the unconscious mind.
*  However, that unconscious mind that lives
*  below the surface of our awareness
*  is also what drives a lot of our unconscious defenses.
*  So our so-called blind spots,
*  so projection, projective identification.
*  These can be both good or bad.
*  They can serve us well or poorly and so on and so forth.
*  But implied in this notion of the unconscious
*  and blind spots is that we can't become aware of things
*  unless we either do dedicated work to become aware of them,
*  or even better would be dedicated work
*  where we are asking other people to say,
*  hey, listen, you have a blind spot
*  and it is blank, blank, and blank.
*  So tell us about the role of blind spots,
*  maybe even some positive aspects of having blind spots,
*  but more importantly, what we can do
*  to fill in those blind spots
*  and perhaps also explain how they can limit us.
*  And if you have any examples from the research
*  where people overcoming their blind spots
*  has benefited them, that would be amazing.
*  Yeah, wow, there's a lot there.
*  Well, let me start by saying,
*  I think a lot of people think about blind spots
*  in terms of heuristics and biases.
*  So you think about confirmation bias.
*  You think about the classic Kahneman-Tversky work
*  that ended up winning Daniel Nobel Prize
*  on the way in which our intuitive judgments
*  often get anchored in the way we've done things before,
*  or we focus on the information that's salient
*  and available to us and overlook less obvious information.
*  I've come to think that the mother of all biases
*  is what I think of as the I'm not biased bias.
*  It's technically called the bias blind spot
*  in Emily Pronen and colleagues' research,
*  but the idea is that I think I'm more objective
*  than other people.
*  And you may have flaws in your thinking, Andrew,
*  but me, I see things clearly and rationally.
*  And I think that it's a really dangerous meta-bias
*  because the moment you believe you're not biased,
*  you are incapable of seeing any of your biases.
*  So in some of the research on the bias blind spot,
*  you see that people who score high in cognitive ability
*  tests, so high IQ, are actually more likely to fall victim
*  to the I'm not biased bias
*  because they've been reinforced for a lifetime
*  that they're really smart and they're good at thinking.
*  Oh, goodness, this explains some,
*  we don't talk about current events on this podcast much,
*  but this explains some current events,
*  people that were told their entire careers
*  that they are perfect or near perfect.
*  And circumstances eventually came to slam them hard
*  into the concrete on that one.
*  Or in some cases, it hasn't happened yet,
*  but we watch them hurtling toward Earth.
*  So I worry a lot about that.
*  So I think the beginning of seeing any blind spot
*  is recognizing that we all have blind spots,
*  it's part of being human.
*  I think that the brighter side of that
*  is that we're not just blind to weaknesses,
*  we're also blind to our strengths.
*  So Jane Dutton and Laura Morgan Roberts and colleagues
*  did some research on the reflected best self portrait.
*  This is one of my favorite exercises to do in the classroom,
*  but also to do in workplaces,
*  sometimes even people end up doing it
*  with their kids at home.
*  The idea is that you do have strengths
*  that you're not that aware of.
*  They may be things that come naturally to you
*  that you don't even realize are hard for other people.
*  They may be things that are struggles for you.
*  And so you think it's hard to do,
*  and therefore I'm bad at it,
*  but other people watch you do it
*  and realize you're actually quite good at it.
*  So you need other people to hold up a mirror
*  to see what these invisible strengths are.
*  So the way the reflective best self exercise works
*  is you're asked to contact 10 to 20 people
*  who know you well in different walks of life.
*  Might be a family member, a couple friends, colleagues,
*  and then you ask them to tell a story
*  about a time when you were at your best.
*  And you collect these stories,
*  it's the most exciting week of email you will ever get.
*  20 notes, let me tell you how great you are.
*  But what's key, this goes back to our discussion
*  of feedback earlier, is they're really specific
*  about a moment when you were at your best.
*  And then your job is to collect all the stories
*  and do the pattern recognition exercise
*  and ask what are the common themes
*  that I've seen through these stories?
*  And it's a really powerful and vivid way
*  of getting a sense of what are those strengths.
*  And it's not surprising that in some of the research
*  when people go through this process,
*  they end up with much more clarity,
*  not only about what they're good at
*  and where their potential lies,
*  but also what do those situations have in common
*  where I was able to use my strengths
*  and how do I get myself in those situations more often?
*  How do I create those situations more often?
*  I'll give you a personal example on this.
*  So I got a bunch of feedback
*  that I was good at helping other people see their strengths.
*  And I thought, okay, I don't feel like
*  I have enough opportunities to use that strength
*  in my daily life, so what am I gonna do about this?
*  And I ended up flipping the exercise upside down.
*  And I picked 100 people who really mattered to me,
*  and I wrote a story to each of them
*  about a time when they were at their best.
*  And there's no reason I can't make this part of my day.
*  It was probably one of the best weeks of my life.
*  It was better than getting the stories, was giving them.
*  And I got these notes back from people saying,
*  I didn't realize, I don't even remember
*  that thing that happened.
*  But I think for me it was an example of saying,
*  okay, I've always enjoyed trying to bring out
*  the best in others.
*  I don't feel like, at the time I was a first year
*  doctoral student, I didn't feel like I had anything
*  to contribute to others.
*  I'm trying to learn how to understand this field
*  and do a worthwhile study and write a paper.
*  I'm not teaching yet, I have no value to add.
*  And getting this feedback, like, oh, you're somebody
*  who helps other people see their potential.
*  I'm like, all right, let me take some people
*  that I already recognize really amazing things in
*  and let me just tell them that.
*  And it took me about a week to write the 100 emails
*  and I can't think of a week I've spent better.
*  Wow.
*  It's so interesting that you flipped the process
*  on its head a bit, or a lot,
*  and that ended up being the reward.
*  Do you think you learned anything about,
*  given that it was early in your academic career,
*  do you think you learned anything about your particular
*  talent or desire to do what you do now?
*  I mean, so much of what you described seems to map well
*  to what you do now.
*  I mean, you could be, if you were to choose,
*  or have chosen just, not just, but a laboratory scientist
*  doing experiments.
*  You're clearly still doing that with tremendous productivity,
*  but you've also decided to tell the world about
*  the information that you're gathering
*  and the work of a lot of other people as well.
*  I guess I feel a kinship here because we both do this.
*  It's much more interesting to cite other people's work
*  than talk about what you already know.
*  It is indeed.
*  And it's fun to be able to weave one's understanding
*  of the process into, you know,
*  like what are other people doing and know how hard it is
*  to do really good experiments
*  and be able to spot really good experiments.
*  But did you learn in that early stage of your career
*  that like, I think I want to do this later
*  because what you do now is, it maps pretty well
*  onto what you just described.
*  I don't think it was, it wasn't crystallized at the time,
*  but it was definitely one of those seeds that was planted
*  that must have grown because I remember,
*  right after I got tenure,
*  a wonderful colleague of mine asked
*  if I would write a book with him.
*  I was so flattered and I went in to talk
*  to my undergrad research lab later that day.
*  And I, you know, I mentioned offhand, I was like,
*  hey, and I got this invite, I'm gonna write this book.
*  And they freaked out.
*  Like, no, you cannot write somebody else's book.
*  You have to write about your ideas first.
*  Like if you're gonna write a book, write your own book.
*  And I was very resistant because I love other people's ideas.
*  No, I feel like what I do best,
*  I think it was Boyer who wrote about
*  the scholarship of discovery
*  versus the scholarship of integration.
*  And I never felt like I was a Eureka, you know,
*  blindingly original insight person.
*  I felt like what I was good at was synthesizing ideas
*  and kind of taking a bunch of pieces of cloth
*  and sewing them into a quilt and allowing people
*  to see the big picture in a way they hadn't before.
*  And I felt like I could do that with a colleague
*  who was already a successful author.
*  And my students basically held me hostage.
*  And they said, you've been doing this research
*  for over a decade now, and you have a responsibility
*  to share that outside your classroom.
*  And it reminded me of that experience of saying,
*  okay, there's something I see in other people,
*  I wanna share it with them.
*  And maybe I could do that on a broader scale.
*  So yeah, I think there were definitely dots
*  that connected there.
*  When I was a master's student at Berkeley,
*  there was a guy who's now moved to Michigan State,
*  Mark Breedlove, who I hope to host on the podcast actually,
*  is this really interesting, does really interesting work
*  on the biology of sexual differentiation.
*  And-
*  Mark, I think that's an invite if you're listening.
*  Right.
*  And he, it is indeed.
*  And he said to me, he said, you know, review articles,
*  provided they are written by people who are credentialed
*  in a given field are cited at, you know, 100X,
*  any one particular paper.
*  Now at the time I wasn't interested in impact factors.
*  In fact, I've never paid any attention to impact factors.
*  They've, their importance varies in different countries.
*  And in the US they play some role, more so in Europe,
*  but I could care less about impact factor, frankly,
*  because those metrics are what's going to carry you
*  through the difficulty of designing
*  and carrying out a hard experiment.
*  You have to be intrinsically curious about the answer,
*  right, you know this and I know this.
*  But he basically said what,
*  something that's really supports your point,
*  which is that ultimately the ability
*  to synthesize information can feel really good.
*  And he started talking about the feeling
*  that he got from doing that.
*  He's also a tremendous bench scientist as well.
*  In any event, I'm so glad that you flipped
*  that exercise on its head because now the world gets
*  to benefit from you doing that for us all the time,
*  because I realize now that much of what you do is
*  to help people identify and erase their blind spots by,
*  and I love your social media channels,
*  and I noted on Instagram and I do scroll,
*  but I scroll through and to your channel too.
*  You know, you'll put up in short form content
*  that really highlights the key importance
*  of people embarking on strategies
*  that they wouldn't reflexively take.
*  I see that over and over again.
*  It's like, we think that the best leaders do blank,
*  but actually the research says they do exactly the opposite
*  and you have a vast kit of those.
*  So along those lines, you know,
*  what are some of the most common blind spots
*  that you observe and that people could benefit
*  from understanding and doing contrary action around
*  as it relates to, let's say interpersonal relations
*  in the workplace or at home?
*  And maybe we could seed this with a finding
*  that you've also written about, which is that, you know,
*  people who have and exert a lot of proficiency
*  and even control in their professional life
*  will sometimes bring that to their relationship life
*  and that doesn't work, right?
*  The idea that like being in charge and being confident
*  is a great set of attributes,
*  but it can really fail us in other domains.
*  Can we weave that in with blind spots?
*  Yeah, we can.
*  So I think that, so one of the things I found
*  over the past few years is that,
*  and this is inspired by a Phil Tetlock framework,
*  a lot of us spend a lot of our time thinking like preachers,
*  prosecutors, or politicians.
*  Preachers, prosecutors, politicians.
*  Yeah, so you can think about these as three mental modes
*  that even if you've never worked in any of these careers,
*  you will watch your thinking colored by at least one
*  of them more often than you would like.
*  So in preacher mode,
*  you're basically proselytizing your own views.
*  And I mean, Andrew, you're a,
*  in some situations I think of you
*  as a highly effective professional debunker
*  of preachers of certain kinds of snake oil
*  when it comes to health and biology.
*  Sometimes you take that too far
*  and people might accuse you of being a prosecutor
*  where you're attacking other people's views.
*  And then the third mode, politician mode,
*  is basically you don't even bother to listen to people
*  unless they already agree with your views.
*  What I think is interesting is these modes of thinking
*  are adaptive in certain roles.
*  So preachers make great salespeople.
*  They're often visionary leaders.
*  Prosecutors are often highly effective scientists.
*  We excel at criticizing other people's work
*  and finding what's wrong with it.
*  Politicians are great at carrying favor.
*  They do a lot of lobbying, they win approval.
*  The problem is that all of these modes stop you
*  from questioning your own assumptions and beliefs.
*  So I'll tell you, my biggest vice is prosecutor mode.
*  I've been called a logic bully.
*  My wife had to explain to me that was not a compliment.
*  Oh my goodness.
*  I know you've experienced this too.
*  If I feel confident that there's strong evidence
*  that somebody is wrong,
*  I believe it's my moral responsibility to correct them.
*  And that never goes well.
*  Amazing.
*  I won't reflect on my own experience.
*  I'll just say yes and yes.
*  Right, the logic word ninja mode is one that,
*  I think we're trained in as academics.
*  We are.
*  And if you're a lawyer or many other professions as well.
*  And I think it holds value and it can be very effective
*  in certain domains, but less effective in other domains.
*  Yes, and I think part of the problem is,
*  actually whether you're preaching, prosecuting,
*  or politicking, excuse me, or politicking,
*  you look like you're not open.
*  Because you've already, in all cases,
*  you think you're right and other people are wrong.
*  And so that makes it really hard for other people
*  to reason with you, to disagree thoughtfully with you.
*  So my favorite alternative,
*  and this is at the heart of what you do for a living,
*  and for fun, is thinking like a scientist.
*  And when I say thinking like a scientist,
*  I do not mean that you need to buy a microscope
*  or invest in a telescope.
*  What I mean is, as you model so effectively,
*  a good scientist has the humility
*  to know what they don't know,
*  and the curiosity to constantly seek out new knowledge.
*  There have been multiple experiments showing that
*  when people are taught to think like scientists,
*  their judgment improves, and so do their decisions.
*  And I think a lot of that stems from,
*  when you go into scientist mode,
*  you realize that all of your opinions
*  are just hypotheses waiting to be tested.
*  All of your decisions are experiments.
*  And so, you're like, well,
*  I'm not trying to prove that I'm right,
*  I'm trying to find out if I might be wrong.
*  And then if I find out I am wrong,
*  it's easier to pivot,
*  and instead of being really invested in being right,
*  I can try to get it right.
*  And I think in some ways, that's the meta message
*  that I'm trying to communicate to people with my work,
*  is assumptions are meant to be pressure tested.
*  They're meant to be questioned and challenged.
*  And if you're not open to rethinking your views,
*  then you basically turn thinking into a religion.
*  And I don't know about you,
*  but I prefer to base my views on good data
*  as opposed to blind faith.
*  And I think that's been a huge part of your contribution
*  in the last three or so years to public discourses.
*  You've helped people think more scientifically
*  and talk more scientifically
*  about their daily habits and behaviors.
*  And I guess my big question is,
*  how do we help people do that more often,
*  even in domains where they don't have access
*  to scientific knowledge and they don't read journals?
*  First of all, thanks for the kind words of feedback.
*  I think my goal is always to identify
*  who's coming to the podcast for health tools and protocols
*  and hopefully teach them some science
*  and scientific thinking.
*  And for those that are coming to the podcast
*  for science and scientific thinking,
*  hopefully they get some health tools and protocols also.
*  But because I fell in love with science
*  for the exact reason that you're describing,
*  which is that I lived,
*  I grew up in a family that was very divided politically,
*  along religious lines,
*  along essentially every line of like what foods to eat,
*  what was healthy, what wasn't.
*  And the only way I could reconcile
*  these very frankly polarized views
*  was to embark on the scientific method,
*  pose a hypothesis and then try and disprove one's hypothesis
*  and some things get through the filter
*  and it's a constant learning.
*  So I should just ask when you teach people
*  how to be a scientist in order to try and overcome
*  some of their blind spots and be better thinkers,
*  better meaning it serves themselves
*  and the people around them better,
*  is that teaching them what a hypothesis is,
*  that a hypothesis is not a question,
*  it's sort of a, you wager on an idea
*  with the understanding that you very well could be wrong
*  and then you try and disprove that idea.
*  Is that sort of the crux of what in these experiments
*  is you're describing as teaching people
*  how to be scientists?
*  Like if they just do that, then they're going to benefit.
*  I think that's at the very heart of the lens,
*  is I wanna just double click on the idea
*  of disproving your hypothesis.
*  Most people live in a land of confirmation bias
*  where they're basically just looking for support
*  for their pre-existing beliefs.
*  That's right, they're click foraging.
*  We all do this, by the way, I'm not criticizing here.
*  We all will have an idea and then we will click forage
*  online to support the idea that we disagree with them,
*  they disagree with us, ah, here's somebody I agree with
*  and that agrees with me.
*  I think, and do you think this has roots in our,
*  in the neural circuit underpinnings of just wanting
*  to have affiliation?
*  That affiliation feels good.
*  Having people that are like us,
*  knowing that we're kind of protected in that.
*  Yeah, I think that's a big part of it.
*  I think one of the reasons that we encase ourselves
*  in echo chambers and hide and filter bubbles
*  is there's a strong evolutionary pressure
*  to avoid social exclusion.
*  And so, it's not just being drawn to affiliation,
*  it's also, I really want, I'm afraid of being
*  excommunicated from my group.
*  And if I challenge the orthodoxy of the community
*  that I belong to, I might be an outcast.
*  And I don't think everyday people think through that logic,
*  but I think there's a deep-seated, visceral tendency
*  to avoid that and I think the, when we think about
*  teaching people to see their blind spots more clearly,
*  a lot of that is recognizing it's hard to do that
*  on your own because by definition, your blind spots
*  are invisible to you and so this is why other people's
*  input is so important and I think, you know,
*  I know this makes a lot of people uncomfortable,
*  but I think everybody on social media should follow people
*  that they disagree with.
*  But not just for the sake of it.
*  You want people who reach different conclusions from you,
*  but where you respect the integrity of their thought process.
*  Those are the people who really stretch your thinking
*  and I think that's what we were trained to do.
*  It's what I was trained to do as a social scientist
*  is to listen to the ideas that made me think hard,
*  not just the ones that made me feel good,
*  and to surround myself with people who challenge
*  my thought process, not just the ones who validated
*  my conclusions and I think, you know, a lot of people
*  hear that message and they're like, no, but I don't want
*  to let that awful perspective into my world.
*  I'm like, no, you want to be more nuanced in saying,
*  who are the people where before I knew what their answer was,
*  I would be impressed with the depth and the thoroughness
*  of their reflection and their analysis.
*  I should be following those people and learning from them
*  regardless of the hypotheses that they generate
*  and the results that they share.
*  I'm so glad that you mentioned the importance
*  of following people that you disagree with.
*  I think one thing that we have to highlight
*  and I'm hoping will maybe even emerge
*  from this conversation is that follows are not endorsements
*  and this is actually a real problem.
*  I mean, there are academics who have lost their jobs,
*  not necessarily for following certain accounts,
*  but for commenting on certain common threads,
*  maybe even a like is a slightly different category
*  because it's, as the name suggests, it's a like,
*  it sounds like and it's thought of as a vote of approval
*  of what's there.
*  But when one's options are just, you know, a heart,
*  a follow or no heart, no follow, you know,
*  I was a big fan of the thumbs up, thumbs down.
*  I kind of like the thumbs up, thumbs down
*  because at least you have an option to dissent
*  without getting into online comment battles
*  and things of that sort.
*  But listen, I've had people ask me,
*  why do you follow so and so?
*  Because follows are also seen as a sign of support
*  because you're adding followers and presumably
*  in the algorithm raising prominence to a channel.
*  But I'm right there with you.
*  I follow lots of accounts of people
*  who I fundamentally disagree with, but I'm trying to learn.
*  And I'm also trying to understand
*  what their capture points are,
*  like why people find them so intriguing.
*  Yes.
*  Anyway, I'm a learner, I'm a forager like you.
*  So I-
*  I'm in the same boat and every once in a while,
*  I think it's stunning to me.
*  I don't know if you've ever looked
*  at your Instagram statistics,
*  but somebody, a colleague of mine actually showed me,
*  I didn't realize you could look at the effect of each post
*  on follows and unfollows.
*  I didn't realize that.
*  And you know, I think my typical ratio
*  might be two or three to one for a post.
*  So I'm gaining two or three followers
*  to every one that I lose.
*  The idea that I could post anything
*  that would cause someone to unfollow me.
*  Like if I said something interesting enough
*  that you thought I was worth following,
*  how could one post change your mind about that?
*  I think you're too focused on what I think
*  and maybe not paying attention to how I think
*  was my first reaction to that.
*  And then my second thought was,
*  well, maybe what's happening here is people show up
*  and they don't realize the foundation of evidence
*  behind the total body of work.
*  And so one post strikes them wrong
*  and they think this person is not credible
*  or they think that this person has lost sight
*  of what rigorous science is.
*  I wonder if you've had that experience too of,
*  I think I make the mistake of taking for granted
*  that anybody who followed me knows
*  that if I post something I think it's worth thinking about
*  and it's been carefully studied.
*  And I didn't have a dog in the fight.
*  I read this research and said,
*  this cleared the bar not only of an academic journal,
*  but I read the methods and I found them sound enough
*  that we ought to be discussing this idea.
*  Have you had that experience too?
*  I certainly have.
*  And I should say that I was weaned in an academic culture,
*  three separate mentors, very different styles.
*  All of whom were excellent mentors,
*  but all of whom taught me that there are phenomenal papers
*  where every bit of information in the paper
*  and indeed how it's written from start to finish
*  is just watertight and incredible.
*  And there are other papers that are less watertight,
*  but occasionally there will be papers
*  where one data point in a figure is intriguing enough
*  to consider following that scent trail in your own work.
*  Even if the rest of the paper is kind of eh,
*  I mean one data point.
*  Now that doesn't mean taking one data point
*  and casting it out to millions of people on social media
*  as an actionable item is valid.
*  That's certainly not what I'm saying.
*  But what I do realize and I'm realizing again now
*  after what you just said is that indeed people
*  don't know the context,
*  like what filters are we working with
*  before we bring things forward?
*  And I think that my belief is that if it's grounded firmly
*  in the scientific method, that that's the best starting place.
*  We were talking about that earlier.
*  And I also understand that scientists differ tremendously
*  in how they look at even the same data in the same paper.
*  So there is no governing body that says,
*  okay, this paper means blank.
*  The authors have their interpretation.
*  The students have their interpretation.
*  In fact, the course I used to teach to undergraduates,
*  which grew into a very large course,
*  we learned to ask four questions.
*  What's the question that the authors were asking?
*  Sometimes a sub question.
*  What methods did they use?
*  What did they find?
*  And then what did they conclude?
*  And does it relate back to the original question?
*  And that simple breaking out of four questions of studies
*  is essentially what I do for all studies.
*  But I have my way of doing it.
*  And it's going to differ from the way
*  that other people do it.
*  Social media, I think what's interesting is that
*  I think there's always going to be a core following
*  of a given person, like your followers,
*  that they're going to trust,
*  not necessarily across the board,
*  but there's a general acceptance of ideas coming through.
*  I think that on social media,
*  it's hard to strike a balance
*  between setting the whole context
*  and the actual takeaways.
*  I get criticized a lot for not being concise enough.
*  And I agree, but I also get criticized
*  for putting things, taking things out of context.
*  Yes, such a tightrope walk.
*  It's a tightrope walk.
*  And it's always going to be a tightrope walk.
*  And so I'm going to just keep going.
*  And I know you will too.
*  And listen, there's some kids out there,
*  surely not going to be one,
*  that are going to take our jobs eventually.
*  And we'll find a way to do it much better.
*  Who knows, through AI or something like that.
*  Might be robots, yeah.
*  Might be robots.
*  I feel like this is an appropriate place
*  to ask about something else,
*  since we're talking about sort of perception of others
*  and gleaning information, overcoming blind spots.
*  It's something that you've written about
*  some years ago now.
*  I guess it would be almost eight years ago now,
*  about authenticity.
*  The word authenticity is such a-
*  Mind field.
*  Such a mind field.
*  I was going to say,
*  has such a positive gravitational pull.
*  Oh, they're really authentic as opposed to,
*  what's the opposite of authentic?
*  Fake. Fake.
*  But I think we could all learn to draw some lines
*  between authenticity and oversharing.
*  How do we gauge authenticity?
*  And we can refer people to that article
*  you wrote some years ago.
*  I think you may have written it differently
*  to be written today.
*  You talked in that article about somebody
*  who essentially decided to tell everyone
*  that he worked with all the things
*  that he was interested in doing with them,
*  relating to them, and it did not serve him well.
*  So that's authenticity. Or them.
*  Right.
*  And so then there's this notion of benevolent deception
*  in order to preserve relationship.
*  And importantly, it brought about a word
*  that we don't hear about very often,
*  but that I rather like, which is etiquette.
*  So for social media, by the way,
*  I apply classroom rules.
*  I'll tolerate any comment in the comment section,
*  but not the sort of comment
*  that I wouldn't tolerate in a classroom.
*  If you start insulting other people, you can insult me.
*  But if you want to insult other people,
*  I'm not going to tolerate that.
*  So that's where I draw the line.
*  Classroom rules. There's an etiquette.
*  And I think that etiquette is important.
*  So how do we balance authenticity with etiquette
*  and also with preserving one's public life or private life?
*  Authenticity at home seems important.
*  You could be your complete self at home,
*  except when you want to physically hit your sister
*  or brother because they ate your ice cream.
*  That's not the right kind of authenticity.
*  No, no, it isn't.
*  I think it's such a rich and complicated topic.
*  First thing is, I don't want people to be disingenuous ever,
*  but I have a real problem with people saying,
*  as an excuse for disrespectful behavior,
*  well, I was just being myself.
*  I think David Sedera said, yes, but yourself is an asshole.
*  So good, so good.
*  And I think what people forget is that
*  we all have multiple selves.
*  You've known this your whole career.
*  We all have multiple identities.
*  We also could think about yourself as your thoughts,
*  your emotions, your values, your personality.
*  So which facet of yourself are you trying to be true to?
*  I would argue that authenticity without boundaries
*  is careless.
*  Authenticity without empathy is selfish.
*  And part of being authentic
*  is caring about other people's values.
*  That should be one of your values.
*  So what that means concretely is,
*  I don't think we should worry about being authentic
*  to what we're thinking and feeling in any given moment.
*  I think what we wanna ask is,
*  what I'm about to do or say consistent with my principles.
*  And sometimes that means you will be false to your personality
*  in order to be true to your values.
*  Sometimes that means you will feel like
*  you're not honoring your thought or your emotion
*  in the moment, but you're doing that
*  with a broader view toward who is the person
*  that I want to be.
*  There was a cultural critic, Lionel Trilling,
*  who wrote about the idea of sincerity
*  as opposed to authenticity.
*  And I really liked this distinction.
*  He said, when you try to think about being authentic,
*  you're trying to bring the inside out.
*  And to your point, Andrew,
*  that's not always appropriate or effective.
*  He said, sincerity is a little bit more
*  about bringing the outside in.
*  So pay attention to the person you claim to be
*  and then try to become that person.
*  And that was a little bit of an aha moment for me.
*  I realized, there are all these people who say,
*  well, you should walk your talk.
*  And I think that's good advice.
*  I might even go a step further and say,
*  maybe you should only talk it
*  if you're already walking it.
*  Maybe, maybe that would help us avoid hypocrisy.
*  But I think the fundamental message here is that
*  we all could be authentic to one part of ourselves
*  and inauthentic to another part.
*  And I think the most important part is to ask,
*  what do I stand for?
*  And if what I'm about to communicate
*  is not consistent with that,
*  then maybe, maybe I could self-censor.
*  Such great advice.
*  And I suppose one has to wonder
*  about the role of emotional states.
*  I think there are career ending mistakes
*  that people make in a moment,
*  especially online nowadays.
*  And by the way, this is not just for people
*  who are already established in their career.
*  I've heard stories
*  and there seem to be more and more of these in the news
*  of, for instance, videos of things that people said
*  some years earlier, getting them ejected from college.
*  A guest on Lex Friedman's podcast
*  who works in the securities world
*  said that one of the lessons that he teaches his kids
*  is to not film themselves doing bad things,
*  and of course, also not to do bad things.
*  But in general, to just not film themselves doing anything
*  because of his understanding of the risk of doing that.
*  And we don't wanna create a paranoia,
*  but gosh, I mean, who you are when you're 14
*  is a very different person than who you are when you're 27
*  and when you're 50.
*  So I hope so.
*  So, you know, and so, yeah, I think, you know,
*  balancing authenticity across the lifespan
*  and we're expecting young minds to do this.
*  And clearly older minds can't do it either.
*  I mean, this is a pretty well-known case
*  of a chair of a major, the major psychiatry department.
*  We won't name the university,
*  but basically lost his job for a single tweet.
*  He just was not being thoughtful.
*  In fact, he was being really like numb to other people
*  and lost his job.
*  And I think he, I don't know him,
*  and it was obvious why he lost it.
*  I don't think it was debatable,
*  but gosh, you think about somebody
*  who's a chair of psychiatry,
*  which means they're a psychiatrist,
*  which means they're trained to think about thinking,
*  and there you go.
*  It's amazing how common this is.
*  And I think one of the things that's fascinating to me
*  is, I guess this goes back to something
*  we were talking about a moment ago,
*  but I think that when we communicate,
*  we have access to the sum total of all of our thoughts
*  and everything we've ever said that we can remember.
*  And we forget that other people only have a snapshot.
*  And so one of the questions I like to ask is
*  if this was the only post that somebody saw of mine,
*  would I be proud of it?
*  Would it communicate who I am and who I aspire to be?
*  That's so good.
*  If the answer is no, maybe I should pause
*  before I put that out there.
*  That is excellent advice.
*  If it were the only post,
*  like your one and only representing you,
*  oh, fantastic.
*  Now that could be paralyzing.
*  If you're a perfectionist, you'll never post.
*  But I think for somebody who's posting regularly,
*  it's a good filter to just ask,
*  am I being thoughtful enough?
*  So good.
*  I won't add anything to that.
*  I'll just say so good.
*  Let's talk about potential.
*  I was in junior high school
*  and I remember having a social studies teacher
*  who she just would go on and on about potential.
*  She had a special program after school.
*  You could get involved, potential, potential, potential.
*  And we hear about this.
*  We have untapped potential.
*  You hear we're only operating at 40% of our abilities.
*  People will say that.
*  The implication is that we have reservoirs of potential
*  that we're just not accessing
*  because we're not doing the right things,
*  thinking the right things.
*  I know you've now researched this topic extensively.
*  You have a new book on this topic.
*  Tell us about potential.
*  Do we all have huge reservoirs of potential
*  that we are not accessing?
*  And of course, I and everyone else wants to know
*  how can we access those?
*  But maybe you could also tell us
*  some of the myths around potential.
*  Yeah, tell us about potential.
*  Such a sticky topic for all the right reasons.
*  Thank you.
*  It's one of those things where,
*  you've had this experience, I'm sure, many times
*  where you start thinking and talking about a topic
*  and you realize it's been your whole life,
*  but you didn't see it until then.
*  And I feel that way about potential.
*  I think that I've been passionate about helping people
*  achieve their potential as long as I can remember.
*  I think every goal I've ever set
*  has been about stretching my potential
*  in one way or another, or at least realizing it.
*  And what I've become so struck by
*  as I've studied this topic is we all have hidden potential,
*  but we don't know how to unlock it.
*  So why do we often underestimate our own potential?
*  We judge ourselves by our starting abilities.
*  And this is more common for people with fixed mindsets,
*  but even people with growth mindsets.
*  You try a new skill, it doesn't go well,
*  and you think this is not for me.
*  I'm not cut out for this.
*  And then it gets worse when other people also,
*  you're not just underestimating yourself,
*  you're also being underestimated by others.
*  Other people watch you and say,
*  yeah, you're not a prodigy, you're not a natural,
*  you don't have the talent that it takes.
*  And I think the big myth there is that raw talent
*  is the most important driver of how high people climb.
*  It's not, motivation and opportunity
*  matter more than raw ability for growth.
*  Motivation and opportunity.
*  Yeah, obviously, everybody starts at a different point.
*  But how close you come to your potential
*  is much more about the character skills you cultivate
*  to improve at improving over time.
*  And then whether you're in a situation
*  where you have access to the knowledge that you need
*  and the tools you need to keep growing.
*  And so, a concrete example of this for me is,
*  when I started diving, I was way too late.
*  I picked it up as a teenager.
*  A lot of the elite divers in the world start by five.
*  Goodness.
*  And actually, in China, they're hand-picked for body type
*  and sent to a version of diving boarding school
*  where they don't even teach kids how to swim.
*  They tie a rope around them
*  so that they can just pull them back
*  after they hit the water in the deep end.
*  What part of their body they tie a rope around?
*  I think it's their waist.
*  So they're diving with a rope
*  so that when they get in the water,
*  they're not wasting any energy.
*  Exactly.
*  So it's just being dragged through the water and out.
*  That's my understanding of it.
*  Wow.
*  But, they have to walk, they have to climb.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay, so there are a bunch of other things they have to do.
*  Yeah, but the swimming apparently is very secondary.
*  Anyway, so I started really late
*  and I lacked most of the things
*  that you would want as a diver.
*  I couldn't touch my toes without bending my knees.
*  My teammates called me Frankenstein
*  because I was so stiff when I walked.
*  So, lacking the flexibility.
*  I have no rhythm.
*  My coach brought a metronome to practice one day
*  and I couldn't even keep the beat.
*  So, you think about diving as a sport of grace, nope.
*  And then I also couldn't jump
*  and I couldn't twist either.
*  And it's like you're missing the explosive power,
*  you don't have the athleticism.
*  And I think if I had just looked at those abilities,
*  I had no business being a diver.
*  And in fact, no business being an athlete.
*  I'd already been cut from the middle school
*  basketball team three times.
*  I didn't make the high school soccer team.
*  Those were the two sports I had poured a decade into.
*  This was going nowhere.
*  Eric, just the most incredible coach I could ever imagine.
*  He said to me on the first day of practice,
*  he said, yes, you're missing all these things.
*  But I believe if you pour yourself into this sport,
*  that you could be a state finalist
*  by the time you finish high school.
*  And he saw more potential in me than I saw in myself
*  and that just lit a fire under me.
*  And what that translated into is a lot of the behaviors
*  that you and I both studied.
*  Setting specific difficult goals
*  for I wanna learn these dives that seem out of reach.
*  For I wanna increase my score
*  over the next three meets by 10 points.
*  For I wanna learn how to,
*  all my limitations notwithstanding,
*  one thing that I can master that I have total control over
*  is how clean I go into the water.
*  I can get a rip entry so that there's no splash
*  and that's the most important part of a dive.
*  And one of the greatest compliments I forgot as a diver
*  was I came out of a meet in,
*  it was a couple of years in,
*  I think I was maybe a junior in high school.
*  And one of the judges turned to Eric and said,
*  all he can do is rip.
*  And Eric said, so?
*  Yes!
*  It's awesome.
*  It's almost like saying all he can do is win.
*  You know?
*  Yeah, it was a great backhanded compliment,
*  but Eric was like, listen, he made the dive.
*  It has a degree of difficulty.
*  Maybe he didn't jump as high as he wanted.
*  Maybe his tuck wasn't as tight as he wanted.
*  But at the end of the day,
*  that dive disappeared straight up and down into the water.
*  You can't not give that a seven.
*  And that ended up serving me really well.
*  And so I think the broader lesson here for me was,
*  Eric said to me, actually last year,
*  I never thought about this.
*  He said, I never got close to even qualifying
*  for Olympic trials.
*  I did not have the talent to be that good,
*  but I got way better than I ever expected.
*  Eric said to me, he said, looking back,
*  he said, you got further with less talent
*  than any diver I've ever coached.
*  And that was so meaningful to me.
*  And what it reminded me was,
*  my proudest accomplishments were not in the areas
*  where I started out with the most talent.
*  They were in the areas where I had overcome
*  the most obstacles.
*  And I think that to me is really what drives people
*  around potential, is to say,
*  it's not performance that's motivating.
*  It's a sense of progress.
*  I love that story.
*  And I couldn't agree more.
*  I mean, I think, or knows my favorite topic in science
*  is the course I performed,
*  at least after my freshman year, which was abysmal,
*  least well in the phase when I was doing well.
*  And what class was it?
*  Neural development.
*  I now teach neural development.
*  I'm sorry, what?
*  Neural development.
*  How bad were you at it at first?
*  Okay, well, I have to put it in context.
*  My high school and freshman year of college were abysmal.
*  Basically no place being there.
*  I can only thank my high school girlfriend
*  for being so wonderful that I followed her off to college
*  and ended up there.
*  Left after my freshman year came back.
*  And then at that point, it was like a step function.
*  I worked out of fear and excitement
*  and love of the material.
*  I was a straight A student thereafter,
*  but in my senior year, excuse me,
*  I took a course in neural development,
*  which was extremely challenging.
*  And I got a B plus and that B plus still gets me,
*  but it's a topic that I love the most.
*  It's what I did my graduate thesis on.
*  It's what I teach at Stanford among other topics.
*  And I like to think now I have, I guess,
*  humility side considerable mastery over the material,
*  but it's because I didn't do as well as I would have liked.
*  And I applied myself so much.
*  And I think that it just didn't come naturally to me.
*  And then eventually over time, you kind of get it
*  or you get it.
*  But it's still my favorite topic
*  because it was that friction point, right?
*  It's the ratcheting through.
*  And there's something, I don't know,
*  that's just so intrinsically satisfying to me.
*  I used to watch my bulldog, Mastiff Costello,
*  like chewing on a bone or when he was on a brick,
*  because he had a kind of a Homer Simpson brain
*  about his object choice to chew on.
*  And he just looked like he was in just total bliss.
*  It was like this effort combined
*  with some intrinsic pleasure of the process.
*  And so I think that when one is ratcheting
*  through something that's hard, it feels so good
*  that it's almost better than the outcome.
*  Like it is better than the outcome.
*  I think it is.
*  And it's fascinating because this is why
*  I'm always bothered by people saying play to your strengths.
*  Because if you do that, you will gravitate
*  toward the things that come naturally to you.
*  And you're gonna miss out on the, very often,
*  the skill that was hard for you to learn, to your point,
*  is one that you end up with greater mastery over
*  because you had to put in the extra effort.
*  And you end up deriving more satisfaction
*  out of the fact that this was really tough
*  and I figured it out.
*  Implicit in your story, and maybe partially explicit
*  in some parts, when I was looking at the character skills
*  that help people realize their potential
*  and really fuel unexpected growth,
*  I ended up finding three that I think are under discussed
*  and well supported by science.
*  I think that basically if you wanna reach your potential
*  or achieve more than you think you're capable of,
*  we're looking at becoming a creature of discomfort
*  and embracing things that are unpleasant or awkward for you.
*  That'll be the first thing.
*  The second is being a sponge and soaking up new information
*  and also filtering out what might not be useful.
*  And then the third is being an imperfectionist,
*  which is knowing when to aim for excellence
*  and when to settle for good.
*  And I hear all of those themes in your story.
*  That was obviously uncomfortable.
*  You gotta be plus.
*  You don't wanna do anymore in neural development.
*  Not at all.
*  It was so frustrating and so exciting to me
*  at the same time.
*  And then I went, everything I did in the five or seven years
*  that followed was all about learning more about this topic
*  because it wasn't about performing well
*  or proving myself.
*  I love the material so much more
*  because of how challenging it was.
*  And I'm grateful to you, Ben Reese,
*  the professor at UC Santa Barbara,
*  incredible neuroanatomist and teacher of neural development
*  and laboratory scientists.
*  Because I think had I gotten an A,
*  I don't know that I would have fallen in love with it
*  in the same way.
*  Isn't that weird?
*  You wouldn't have had to work at it to discover
*  what was fun about it, I imagine.
*  No, absolutely.
*  And it's still one of my favorite topics to teach
*  and learn about.
*  So you mentioned discomfort, being a sponge slash filter,
*  if I got that right.
*  And an imperfectionist.
*  Yeah, tell me more about the imperfectionist piece
*  because I feel like I've had students in my lab
*  and I've known people in other domains of life
*  that they're absolutely paranoid about shipping something out
*  for the world to see it.
*  And of course, no one wants to put stuff out into the world
*  that isn't right and God forbid could be wrong,
*  or that's going to embarrass us.
*  So you can understand why people are perfectionists,
*  but I never really understood the extreme perfectionists.
*  How do they ever do anything?
*  And are they happy people?
*  Because I can't imagine that they are.
*  No, I mean, this is, so Thomas Curran,
*  I think is the world's leading psychologist
*  studying perfectionism.
*  And if you look at his meta-analyses,
*  perfectionism is a recipe for burnout
*  and depression and anxiety
*  because you're constantly comparing yourself
*  to an ideal that's unachievable.
*  Perfectionists are not,
*  they do get better grades in school slightly,
*  but they don't do any better at work than their peers
*  because I think in school, you have a predictable outcome.
*  You have a general sense of what's gonna be on a test
*  and if you study hard enough,
*  you can come closer to the A plus.
*  Whereas at work, performance is much more nebulous.
*  And so what happens to perfectionists a lot of times
*  is they end up optimizing the things
*  that are predictable and controllable,
*  and then sort of missing the forest and the trees.
*  And I think the antidotes, as far as I know,
*  really have to do with calibration.
*  So I talked earlier about how I like to ask for a zero to 10
*  to find out am I in the ballpark or not?
*  Well, one of my biggest liabilities as a diver was
*  I was never satisfied with my score.
*  And one day Eric said to me,
*  you hear Olympic judges talk about,
*  or commentators talk about the perfect 10?
*  That's a misnomer.
*  If you look at the diving rule book,
*  a 10 is for excellence, not for perfection.
*  There's no such thing as a flawless dive.
*  I can look at dives that have gotten straight 10s
*  and point out 19 things that were wrong with them,
*  but they were excellent.
*  And so then we had to define the standards of excellence.
*  So what I have as a recovering perfectionist,
*  somebody who just beat myself up constantly,
*  in fact, I got, we did paper plate awards on my swim team.
*  And one year I was given the if only award,
*  and there's a little cartoon of me and it says,
*  if only I had pointed my left pinky toe,
*  I would have gotten an eight and a half instead of an eight.
*  And that was like the story of my diving career.
*  And I did not wanna be that person anymore.
*  And so one of the things I've learned to do is to,
*  when I start anything, if I sit down to write a book,
*  I'm aiming for a nine.
*  And the reason for that is I'm gonna pour a couple of years
*  of my work life into this topic.
*  Hopefully a lot of people are gonna read it,
*  and I wanna make sure it's truly the best work
*  I can produce.
*  Social media posts, I'm okay with a seven.
*  If I'm only shooting for a nine,
*  I'm not gonna post very often,
*  because your ceiling for nine,
*  or your threshold for nine is so exceedingly high.
*  And I wanted to keep getting higher over time.
*  So my idea of a nine today is much more challenging
*  than it was 10 years ago.
*  And I think this is what people probably don't do enough,
*  especially if you're an extreme perfectionist,
*  is they don't realize, okay,
*  let me figure out how important this task is.
*  And then for this task, a six is sufficient,
*  so that then I can pour my energy into pulling
*  the seven and a half toward a nine where it really matters.
*  And inevitably, if you don't do that,
*  what you will do is you will get a bunch of nines
*  on things that are completely trivial.
*  I went to a high school where we had a couple of kids
*  get perfect on the SAT.
*  They would have the big centerfold list
*  of all the early admissions
*  to all the fancy Ivy League schools.
*  Definitely was not on that list.
*  I don't even know if I,
*  yeah, I don't even know if I was anywhere near that list.
*  Probably not.
*  And some of them have gone on to have terrific lives
*  and seem pretty happy.
*  And I know a number of them and I'm in contact with them.
*  And I think for some of them that performed exceedingly well
*  on standardized tests early on,
*  I hear a bit more dismay in their current life.
*  Not all, but is there,
*  I have to imagine there are data
*  on sort of early high performance
*  being a seed for challenges later on.
*  Obviously you don't want the opposite.
*  This sort of what I guess they refer to now
*  as a complete failure to launch.
*  People not meeting the milestones
*  towards being self-sufficient adults.
*  But yeah, what are some of the dangers of success
*  when thinking about realizing one's larger potential?
*  Oh, that's such an interesting question.
*  I think, yeah, I think the data on this go both ways.
*  So some early success is, it's a motivator.
*  It builds the kind of momentum
*  you were talking about earlier.
*  There's a goal setting researchers like Locke and Latham
*  have talked about the high performance cycle
*  where you hit a goal and then that builds your confidence.
*  And then you set a more ambitious goal and then you reach it
*  and there's this upward spiral over time.
*  But there's also a mountain of evidence
*  that achieving your goals can make you complacent.
*  And there's a, sometimes it's called the fat cat syndrome
*  where you end up resting on your laurels.
*  And then there are also competency traps
*  where you get good at something
*  and then you keep doing it the way you've always done it
*  and you don't realize the world has changed around you.
*  Like I'm allergic to the idea of best practices.
*  The moment you call a practice best,
*  you've created an illusion that you're done.
*  And the moment, like think about pre-COVID,
*  a lot of companies had really,
*  what they thought were effective models for collaboration.
*  And all of a sudden their best practices are not feasible
*  because everybody's working remotely.
*  And they've got to throw that out the window
*  and look for better practices for an evolved world.
*  So I think those are the things I worry about most
*  with early success.
*  I think that one of the things I would love to see
*  more people do when it comes to reaching potential
*  is to figure out what does my failure budget look like?
*  So I'll tell you my experience on this.
*  You know, I wrote a first book, gave a TED Talk,
*  and pretty soon felt like I was spending 80% of my time
*  saying things I already knew.
*  And I was getting typecast.
*  I'm like, I'm not learning and growing,
*  but I'm also not, I don't feel like I'm contributing
*  new knowledge to the world.
*  What am I gonna do about that?
*  And 2018 rolls around and I'm like, you know what?
*  I'm gonna start a podcast
*  and that will be my learning mechanism.
*  And I didn't know if it was gonna work.
*  I didn't know how the medium would work for me.
*  I didn't know if people were gonna wanna listen to my voice.
*  I certainly don't.
*  Maybe Morgan Freeman likes the sound of his own voice.
*  I like listening to your podcast.
*  I also enjoy listening to yours,
*  but I think everybody hates the sound of their voice.
*  I just wasn't sure for a lot of reasons
*  whether it was gonna work.
*  And then I thought about it and I realized,
*  well, all of the pivotal moments in my career
*  have come from taking a risk.
*  And I thought that I needed to build the confidence
*  in order to do it.
*  And I was reflecting on goal setting research as one does
*  and realized, you know,
*  the confidence is gonna come through doing it.
*  And so let me try it.
*  And I guess what I took away was if I never fail,
*  it means I'm not challenging myself.
*  I'm not embracing discomfort.
*  I'm not being enough of an imperfectionist.
*  So I actually set a goal that I would start
*  at least one project every year that didn't succeed.
*  And let's be clear, I'm not aiming for failure.
*  What I'm doing is creating an acceptable zone of failure
*  to know that that's gonna motivate some risk-taking
*  and some experimentation and hopefully some growth.
*  And I know it's hard for a lot of people
*  to do this in their lives,
*  especially if you have a super demanding boss.
*  But I think we're all better off
*  from a growth and potential standpoint.
*  If we've got, you know,
*  if you succeed on 90% of your projects,
*  that should be a hugely successful year.
*  If you succeed on 100%, I think you're aiming too low.
*  What are some of the projects
*  that you are currently spinning in the back of your mind
*  that would be fun, but if you're willing to share
*  that for you still strike a little bit of an anxiety chord,
*  like, oh no, like, are you, I don't know,
*  are you a musician?
*  Do you know music?
*  Not at all.
*  Can't carry a tune.
*  Can't keep a beat.
*  Are you thinking about becoming a musician
*  or exploring playing music?
*  I mean, the reason I ask it that way is
*  how far into your discomfort zone do you reach
*  in order to challenge yourself?
*  Because I think that everyone needs to have thresholds.
*  There are a lot of things that, yeah,
*  I wish I could play a musical instrument, frankly,
*  but I'm not that motivated to do it.
*  Mostly because I enjoy hearing other people play music
*  so much that I'm perfectly happy.
*  I'm sated.
*  Yeah, there's also enough good music out there.
*  You don't have to create it.
*  Yeah, there's definitely a lot of great music, yeah.
*  So I think there's a micro and a macro version of this.
*  So on the micro side, in the past year,
*  I did this Work Life podcast for five years
*  where I was taking the core of my organizational
*  psychology work and trying to take on a topic
*  and make it interesting and useful to people.
*  And then realizing I was feeling constrained
*  just to focus on work, and as a psychologist,
*  there are lots of other things I wanna take on.
*  And so we expanded into this second show, Rethinking.
*  And I have some experiments I'm tempted to try,
*  but I've been really hesitant to do them.
*  Did you watch wrestling growing up ever?
*  Professional wrestling?
*  Yeah.
*  I did watch a little bit of it.
*  And then for whatever reason, in the last year,
*  my good friend Rick Rubin, he's not obsessed,
*  but he is a real devotee.
*  He's a fan of professional wrestling.
*  He had me watch some WWE, but even AEW.
*  He was explaining that it's basically physical drama.
*  He's explaining why it's so intriguing to him
*  and so informative to him.
*  And then I'm a big fan of certain genre of music.
*  And Lars Fredriksen from Rancid is a huge wrestling fan.
*  So now I've got multiple people
*  that I've come into contact with
*  who are telling me all this stuff about wrestling.
*  So wrestling seems to be cropping up more and more.
*  All right, so I don't know the first thing about wrestling.
*  I think I caught it a few times as a kid.
*  Likewise, it was Hulk Hogan
*  and a few others passed across the screen.
*  Macho Man, yeah.
*  But the thing that I remember
*  was loving the tag team matches
*  where somebody would get overpowered
*  and then they pull in somebody to help.
*  I think it would be so interesting if there was a podcast
*  where you take issues
*  that people fundamentally disagree on
*  and you start a debate and then somebody can tag in
*  if they wanna challenge an argument.
*  And so instead of concentrating on the particular guests,
*  you basically have a problem you're trying
*  to get to the roots of
*  and you're gonna have all these people jump in
*  and hopefully build toward
*  a more insightful perspective on it.
*  I have no idea if this is gonna work.
*  I'd really love to try it.
*  And this is the first time I've spoken out loud about it
*  because I don't know that I wanna see that crash and burn.
*  And yet, why not?
*  What's the risk?
*  I think it's so cool.
*  It'll be fun, right?
*  Yeah, what topics are you thinking about covering?
*  Because I can think of some pretty controversial topics,
*  but I wanna know what the ones you're thinking about.
*  Well, I mean, I literally just,
*  I mean, I'm thinking out loud here,
*  but one that I think on the controversial front
*  that could be really rich is
*  to think about policies for trans athletes in sports.
*  That's a controversial topic.
*  It's hugely controversial,
*  but also I've talked to some experts on this.
*  I've talked to some trans athletes
*  and the people who are deep in this
*  do not know what they think the policy should be.
*  And so I think actually hearing them talk
*  and understanding the complexity of those issues
*  and then maybe hammering out
*  what's a policy you would propose for schools?
*  What would you want for Olympic events?
*  I just think that would be fascinating.
*  I'd love to moderate that discussion.
*  Oh my goodness.
*  Maybe I wouldn't.
*  I wouldn't.
*  I don't wanna wait into that one.
*  I'm glad you would.
*  I wouldn't.
*  That seems like one of the most barbed wire topics
*  one could ever embark on,
*  which is exactly why I'm gonna put in my vote.
*  You absolutely should do this podcast.
*  I think it's an amazing idea.
*  Actually folks, put in the comment section on YouTube
*  whether or not Adam should do this podcast
*  and that topic in particular.
*  I think it would be amazing
*  because one thing that I keep coming back to
*  in my own mind is that a lot of the controversies
*  out there stem from the fact that we very often
*  have individuals pitted against individuals.
*  And there's so much lost in that.
*  And I think about science
*  and going back to the scientific method
*  where we have subfields pitted against subfields
*  when you talk about a field.
*  Like there was huge controversy over the structure of DNA
*  and it wasn't one individual against another.
*  What you had are small groups, different camps.
*  And there was some partial overlap.
*  If you read the double helix,
*  there was also a lot of complicated behavior.
*  People entering romantic relationships
*  just to glean information from the other side.
*  Human beings not at their finest.
*  But in any event, small panels arguing, competing,
*  teams competing I think is far more interesting
*  and informative than individuals butting heads.
*  I think so too.
*  And I think another one that I think
*  would be really interesting.
*  People always say great minds think alike.
*  No, great minds challenge each other to think differently.
*  And we just don't do enough of that.
*  So I've been thinking a lot politically.
*  What if we brought together a bunch of people
*  who are not ideologues but are really interested
*  in pragmatic policy solutions to rewrite the constitution
*  if we were gonna build one today?
*  You'd like to tackle big stuff.
*  I just.
*  No, I love it.
*  I love it.
*  It's a compliment.
*  Like I said earlier, no weak sauce.
*  No weak sauce.
*  Like you just, you go right for it.
*  I mean, listen, these are the issues
*  that people are really activated by
*  because these are really core issues.
*  They get down to the autonomic nervous system.
*  They're in the hypothalamus as we say.
*  But I don't think they should be.
*  Like I look at these topics and think,
*  I just wanna get it right.
*  Like I don't have a vested interest
*  in what the model should be.
*  I just know that even the wisest people of 250 years ago
*  were not prepared to anticipate the world we live in today.
*  And we ought to be constantly, I don't know.
*  I don't think you should live in a world
*  where you affirm your beliefs.
*  I think the only way you learn
*  is by continually evolving your beliefs.
*  And so I guess I'm trying to figure out more ways
*  to catalyze that around issues people care about.
*  But I don't care about the issues.
*  I care about the stretching of thinking
*  and the improving the way that the world works.
*  Well, I'll tell you, if you decide to do this podcast
*  with the tag team format,
*  I love that you gleaned it from watching wrestling
*  a couple of times around these very controversial issues.
*  I promise you that will be one of the most popular
*  and important podcasts on the planet Earth.
*  It might be podcasts on other planets.
*  I hear that their galaxy is far, far away with a,
*  they may have podcasts too.
*  May have had them for much longer than we have.
*  But that's a winner.
*  Well, maybe I'll try it as a little experiment
*  on the rethinking feed
*  and see if it's an unmitigated disaster.
*  Well, you know where my vote lies.
*  I appreciate that.
*  So, okay, so to go back to your question for a second,
*  on the macro side, I've always thought it would be fun
*  to try to write a sci-fi novel.
*  And the question I'm wrestling with right now
*  is, is that a good use of my time?
*  Like there are great sci-fi writers out there.
*  There aren't that many social scientists communicating
*  about the topics that I do.
*  And it feels like it might be, I don't know,
*  like this is, it might be too much of a diversion.
*  Then again, according to your words,
*  you had no talent in diving,
*  but you exceeded all performance metrics
*  by considerable amount through motivation and opportunity.
*  I get that right.
*  I vote yes.
*  I haven't read much sci-fi.
*  Maybe I need to read more sci-fi.
*  Are you a fan of sci-fi?
*  I love sci-fi.
*  It's one of my favorite ways to imagine a better world
*  and also prevent a worse one from emerging.
*  But I don't know, there's a part of me that thinks,
*  all right, there's a, there's a,
*  Root Bernstein and colleagues did this,
*  do you know this research on Nobel Prize winning scientists
*  and what differentiates them from their peers?
*  No, but being the son of a physicist
*  and having been surrounded by, just by circumstance,
*  a number of Nobel Prize winners when I was a kid,
*  young kid, I'm very curious to know what this research says.
*  I mean, there are many themes you could glean from it,
*  but the thing that really jumped out at me is
*  the Nobel Prize winners were more likely
*  to have artistic hobbies.
*  Feynman certainly did.
*  Yep.
*  I mean, there's a long list of them,
*  but if you break it down in the data,
*  it was they're twice as likely as their peers
*  to play a musical instrument.
*  They're seven times as likely to draw or paint.
*  They're 12 times as likely to do poetry
*  or fiction, creative writing.
*  And get this, 22 times as likely as their peers,
*  22 to dance, act, or yes, perform as magicians.
*  As a former magician, I was very excited by this.
*  Yeah, well, I wasn't going to ask about magic,
*  but let's talk about it.
*  I was on vacation with,
*  every year I take my sister to New York
*  for her birthday and my birthday,
*  because our birthdays are close together.
*  And we went and saw a magician mentalist
*  by the name of Ossie Wind.
*  Ossie, I think is the correct pronunciation.
*  Who just like the last time I saw him,
*  absolutely blew my mind.
*  There's no way, it's not magic.
*  Of course I know it's not magic,
*  but my understanding is that there's some things
*  that he and other great mentalist and magicians do
*  where they're not absolutely certain of the outcome.
*  They're playing, it's probabilistic.
*  And so there's a risk and a thrill for them too.
*  And that they're also creating memories
*  and erasing memories.
*  And that's something that we,
*  I may host Ossie on the podcast because
*  that would be fun.
*  He's very effective at creating memories
*  and erasing memories.
*  That's a lot of what he does.
*  And he has tactics to do that.
*  In any event, I wasn't going to ask about magic,
*  but I know that you were a professional magician
*  at one point in your life,
*  and that you did this presumably
*  because you enjoy doing it.
*  But getting beyond the sort of pull the rabbit out of the hat
*  or pick it or identify the card that the person picked out
*  or the shuffled stack.
*  What is it and what was it about magic that intrigues you?
*  Does it inform anything about the work that you do now?
*  It does, yeah.
*  I think when I started, I was 12 and it was just fun.
*  And I was looking for a way to entertain other people
*  and entertain myself in the process.
*  And then, you know, it became a challenge.
*  Can I learn this new skill?
*  And can I master this trick?
*  I think nerdiest thing I did in college
*  was I started a magic club with David Kwong,
*  who is a stellar magician and a cruciverbalist,
*  as he calls it.
*  Cruciverbalist.
*  He does magic crossword puzzles, essentially,
*  that I can't do it justice.
*  You have to see it.
*  It's unreal.
*  And I watched him for our first performance together
*  and realized one of us is gonna make it as a magician
*  and it's not me.
*  He's outstanding.
*  Anyway, the way it figures in my work now is,
*  I think so much of good science communication is misdirection.
*  And it's the same skill I used as a magician.
*  If I told you that the card you picked
*  was about to disappear from the deck
*  and appear on the window,
*  you would not be nearly as intrigued
*  as if it happened by surprise.
*  And I think the same is true when we communicate knowledge.
*  I think it's actually why so many of my posts,
*  you flagged this earlier, so many of my posts start with,
*  you know, this thing is not what you think.
*  It's actually this other thing.
*  I think that, you know, challenging conventional wisdom,
*  questioning assumptions is what surprises people
*  and then leads them to think,
*  either I have something to learn or,
*  oh no, I gotta put up a shield
*  because my beliefs are being challenged or attacked.
*  And I think the art form of magic
*  was always about creating a surprise
*  that would delight people,
*  as opposed to leading people to feel like they were tricked
*  or duped or manipulated.
*  And so I think the challenge for me is to say,
*  okay, I wanna figure out what do we know
*  from behavioral science,
*  you know, mostly focusing on psychology
*  because that's my core expertise.
*  What do we know that's actually different
*  from most intuition?
*  And then how do I explain that in a way
*  that surprises people but leads them to say,
*  oh, that's so interesting,
*  as opposed to that's wrong and then wanna fight about it.
*  It's almost as if you give them the experience
*  of what you're trying to teach them so that the,
*  oh, that's wrong can't be the available response.
*  Yes.
*  Because in magic, you know, it's,
*  everyone knows it's magic,
*  just like with professional wrestling folks, by the way,
*  there's some prior understanding of what's gonna happen.
*  Maybe they go off script,
*  but I think that's actually, I think,
*  part of the interest in professional wrestling
*  for those that are extreme fans of professional wrestling
*  is that they almost want to wonder about
*  whether or not some of it is not in the plan.
*  Like it's a suspension of reality
*  that they seem to enjoy, right?
*  Because if you know something's fake or,
*  well, we should be,
*  I should be more careful about my language.
*  With magic, like when I went to see Asi,
*  I mean, I don't think it's actual magic,
*  but he's able to give the illusion of magic.
*  The real illusion is that it's magic, right?
*  It's not the illusion of making the card hop
*  to somewhere else in the room.
*  And he is phenomenal and I highly recommend people
*  go see his show if they get the opportunity.
*  I think they're doing a documentary about him now,
*  actually, there'll be some Netflix stuff as well.
*  But it's the illusion that magic exists that's so exciting.
*  So with science communication,
*  I always aim for four things.
*  I don't always achieve them,
*  and I think you do as well, if I may,
*  that a topic be interesting, clear,
*  ideally actionable, but not always.
*  And the the quad effect is when it's also surprising.
*  So interesting, clear, actionable,
*  and surprising sort of is the ultimate,
*  if there's sort of a, like, oh, I didn't realize that.
*  But it's hard to find data points
*  that satisfy all four criteria.
*  And the surprising is the least important by far.
*  I assume table stakes is, it's rigorous.
*  Oh, well, okay, sitting underneath all four
*  of those points are that it's actual science, right?
*  Someone didn't just say it, right?
*  It's not conjecture or theory.
*  So that means that there's data to support it
*  and that the data were collected
*  with the appropriate amount of rigor, right?
*  So there's a reservoir of stuff
*  that sits underneath as a foundation.
*  Yes, so given the baseline of rigor,
*  how do I find what's interesting, clear, actionable,
*  and hopefully surprising?
*  Although, okay, I would make a case.
*  There's a classic article that Murray Davis wrote,
*  one of my all-time favorites.
*  He was a sociologist who wrote a paper
*  called That's Interesting.
*  And he opened the paper by saying,
*  ideas live not because they're true,
*  but because they're interesting,
*  which decimated one of my core beliefs.
*  I thought it was accuracy that drove people's beliefs.
*  And he said, no, ideas live because they're interesting.
*  And then he goes to build an index of the interesting
*  to explain when people are intrigued.
*  And his case is that most of interest is surprise.
*  And he breaks down all the ways
*  that you can turn conventional wisdom upside down.
*  You can say that something you thought was bad
*  was actually good, or vice versa.
*  You can argue that something you thought was homogeneous
*  is actually heterogeneous.
*  You could argue that something you thought was individual
*  was actually a collective phenomenon, or vice versa.
*  And he's got this wonderful breakdown
*  of all the ways of being interesting.
*  And he's the one who made the distinction between ideas
*  that challenge weakly held assumptions intriguing you,
*  and strongly held assumptions sort of offending you.
*  But I think from Davis's view, and I think he's right,
*  a huge amount of interest is surprise.
*  And so, but I don't think it's the only driver of interest.
*  I might take your criteria and say,
*  okay, we start with rigor.
*  We wanna go to interest, clarity, and actionability.
*  How do we get to interest?
*  Let's build a sub-model of the factors that drive interest.
*  And surprise might have the biggest beta weight
*  in the regression equation.
*  But what else drives interest?
*  I have a couple of hypotheses.
*  I wanna hear yours.
*  You've been doing this actively and highly effectively.
*  Beyond surprise, what else interests people in your content?
*  Anything that draws on self-reflection for them.
*  I think we all have an innate desire
*  to better understand ourselves, why we work the way we do,
*  why we don't work as well as we would like to
*  in certain domains.
*  And cast understanding on our experiences of others too.
*  Like, oh, now it makes sense.
*  Like, I'm going back to the Conti episodes,
*  but we did several of them, so I think it's appropriate
*  to learn from him that narcissism is envy,
*  it represents a extreme deficiency in the pleasure.
*  Narcissists can have an extreme pleasure drive,
*  but they always feel like they have far less
*  than they would like to have
*  and that others have far more of it
*  because they don't have that same yearning for it.
*  And so that narcissism at its core is deep envy.
*  That to me was like, wow.
*  And to realize that and to now understand
*  that all this discussion that you hear out there
*  about narcissists, everyone calling other people narcissists,
*  that there are genuine narcissists out there
*  and what they really suffer from is an extreme deficit
*  in pleasure and they're constantly envious of others.
*  It reframed everything I thought about narcissists,
*  about them being overbearing, which they can be
*  and often are, et cetera, et cetera.
*  So I think it's also anything that leads to like,
*  oh, I can navigate narcissists better with that.
*  Well, that, I mean, that checks all your boxes.
*  It's very surprising because it's not the way
*  we normally understand narcissism.
*  But I think you hit on for me what's the,
*  maybe even it's at least as important as surprise,
*  maybe more so is self-relevance.
*  And it doesn't have to be actionable, right?
*  It has to, in a lot of cases, just help you understand
*  or make sense of something that's been puzzling
*  or that's sort of, I think I'm almost always surprised
*  when I say something from, here's a synthesis of research,
*  here's a meta-analysis.
*  And I think it's kind of obvious.
*  And people get excited about it because it gave them
*  language to describe something they had felt,
*  but they didn't know how to articulate or talk about.
*  And I think that, I mean, I think this is why
*  most of the most popular TED Talks are about human behavior
*  because people are interested in people.
*  And if you learn something about you or about others,
*  you don't have to immediately do anything with that
*  to find it intriguing and even useful
*  because it enriches your worldview.
*  A recent guest on this podcast, we haven't aired it yet,
*  but maybe it'll be out by time this airs,
*  was with Lisa Feldman Barrett.
*  She's a psychologist.
*  Her neuroscientist.
*  Right, studies emotion.
*  Emotion, of course.
*  Yeah, and she described how in certain cultures
*  there is a language for subcategories of emotion.
*  Emotional granularity.
*  Right, so she described a word in Japanese,
*  I don't recall what the word was,
*  that describes the feeling of sadness that one has
*  after getting a particularly bad haircut,
*  something that I don't think you or I are familiar with,
*  but I'm familiar with from my experience
*  of romantic partners being like really unhappy
*  about their haircut and you're like, you're sad,
*  but by having a specific word for a specific experience,
*  people feel less alone
*  and the feeling passes more quickly in time.
*  And then she gave some other examples from German
*  and from Scandinavian languages and so forth.
*  And I find this so interesting.
*  It's like the moment people hear
*  that they are not alone in an experience,
*  there's nothing actionable about it,
*  but it creates a cognitive shift thereafter
*  in which they suffer less
*  or may feel more connected to others.
*  I mean, I think it's really a beautiful example
*  of exactly what you're referring to.
*  Like when we learn about something
*  and we identify with it, it's powerful.
*  It's very powerful.
*  And I think psychologists often say name it to tame it.
*  Affect labeling is one of the most effective
*  emotion regulation strategies.
*  When we talked about distraction and reframing earlier,
*  I should have said there's a third strategy,
*  which is literally just to describe what you're feeling.
*  It seems to allow people then to reason with
*  and process whatever they're feeling
*  as opposed to allowing the feeling to control them.
*  And I probably got the clearest sense of this.
*  In 2021, I read a New York Times article on languishing,
*  the feeling of meh or blah.
*  And I have never had anything,
*  any article I wrote resonate like this.
*  And it just, all the posts that tagged me
*  were just like, it me, it me, it us.
*  And it was like one and two word reactions.
*  And I don't think it was the content that mattered to people.
*  It was just having the term.
*  All of a sudden people realize,
*  this was originally Corey Keys' research
*  that I was referencing.
*  It had been a light bulb for me to say,
*  if you think about the spectrum of wellbeing,
*  this is related to your mental illness
*  versus mental health distinction.
*  Those are two extremes of the continuum.
*  And at one end we have depression and burnout.
*  On another end we have wellbeing and flourishing.
*  Languishing lives right in the middle.
*  As Corey describes it, it's the absence of wellbeing.
*  So you're not depressed, you still have hope.
*  You're not burned out, you still have energy.
*  But you're not at peak functioning.
*  You're missing a sense of purpose.
*  You feel like you're stagnating and you're empty.
*  There was something about just saying the word languishing
*  that led people to realize, yeah, that's a thing.
*  And of course we're languishing,
*  we're standing still in the middle of a global experiment
*  that no one opted into,
*  which violates all rules of consent by science
*  the last time I checked.
*  But I think that that's something that probably
*  is underrepresented when we're trained
*  to communicate as scientists.
*  To say one of the most valuable things we do
*  is we give people language to talk about things.
*  And I think that's a massive part of your impact is,
*  this is one of the big things I've learned from you, Andrews.
*  I used to be a little bit dismissive
*  of cognitive neuroscience in particular.
*  I thought understanding the brain
*  has not taught me that much about the mind.
*  Being able to trace, let's take a simple example.
*  When I read Joe Ledoux's research,
*  being able to trace certain amygdala responses
*  as the root of how people deal with fight or flight
*  and threat, I'm like, I don't know that that
*  helped me that much.
*  Like if I could just describe fight or flight,
*  do I need the amygdala?
*  And you've convinced me I was wrong about that.
*  Because when people have, when they understand
*  the neurological substrates of their thoughts,
*  feelings and actions, they believe them more.
*  They're like, oh, there is a mechanism for this.
*  It's being produced inside my head.
*  And even though I can't see it, it's there
*  and it can be studied with the tools of science.
*  I think that's a really big deal.
*  And I really regret the fact that I didn't spend more time
*  on cognitive neuroscience because I think
*  I'd be a better psychologist today.
*  Oh, well, again, thanks for the kind words.
*  I think that a fortunate evolution in our fields,
*  or even field, if I may, over the last 10 years
*  is that whereas neuroscience itself even needs
*  to be subdivided into neuroanatomy and neurophysiology,
*  it's lumped into all neuroscience.
*  But it now includes psychology, computational neuroscience,
*  cognitive neuroscience, it's all, I think,
*  I consider us, we have different perspectives
*  and different training, obviously,
*  but doing a lot of the same things,
*  just using different dissection tools
*  and different language-based tools.
*  And listen, what you've done, I wouldn't even say masterfully,
*  I mean, just with like extreme virtuosity
*  is to wrap your hands around such an enormous literature
*  related to psychology, I mean, the human mind and behavior
*  and thought processes and emotions and potential
*  and so many topics and to extract the most valuable gems
*  from that literature and communicate them
*  in a way that anyone can understand.
*  And it's an extreme gift to be able to do that.
*  And it's clear it's working because, like you mentioned
*  this article on languishing, which we will provide
*  a reference or a link to in our captions
*  because I wanna go read that now.
*  I mean, I'm always struck by this feeling of like,
*  I'm not tired, but I've got tons to do,
*  but why do I just wanna sit here?
*  Maybe I need to sit here, but then you get into all the,
*  well, okay, but I need it, there's a lot to do,
*  there's a lot to get up and go, I don't wanna waste my life
*  and yeah, rest is good too.
*  But I think languishing is something that,
*  I definitely can resonate with that.
*  So when I had a bulldog, it felt a lot easier to do
*  because he was always languishing.
*  But do you ever just languish or are you busy enough
*  that you just feel like you're always a forward center of mass?
*  I think everybody languishes.
*  I think it's part of the human condition.
*  And I think it might even be evolutionarily adaptive
*  because I remember another sort of mind-altering idea.
*  I remember reading Randy Nessie's argument
*  that mild depression could be evolutionarily functional.
*  That obviously clinical depression
*  is debilitating in a lot of ways,
*  but low-grade sadness, Lincoln's melancholy,
*  we know one of the things it can do
*  is broaden your field of vision.
*  And for many people, sadness is a signal
*  that something is not working
*  and it can motivate problem solving.
*  It can, in some cases, open access to new perspectives.
*  Unfortunately, those potential benefits of sadness
*  are often overridden by the motivational cost
*  and also the fact that you now spend all this time
*  regulating your sadness and wondering why you're sad.
*  And so it's hard to harness.
*  But I had a similar thought about languishing
*  from this perspective to say that maybe moments of languishing
*  open us up to change.
*  When we get stuck, sometimes we realize
*  you have to move backward in order to make progress.
*  Sometimes you have to unlearn things
*  that you thought you knew in order to keep growing.
*  And I don't, a friend of mine said,
*  he read my languishing piece,
*  and he's like, you're not the languishing type.
*  I'm like, okay, maybe everybody's baseline is different.
*  I think one of the things I'm really lucky to have
*  is high reserves of energy.
*  But for me, languishing is,
*  I felt like I did nothing today.
*  And in a typical day, if I'm writing a book,
*  I should be able to write a thousand words I'm proud of.
*  And I don't like a single word that I produced.
*  Or I sat at my blinking cursor,
*  like staring at the computer screen,
*  and for that umpteenth time, wondered,
*  did they call it a cursor
*  because of all the writers who've cursed it?
*  And then I end up Googling,
*  what are the Latin roots of the word cursor?
*  Where did this come from?
*  And that is not a good use of time.
*  That's not forward mass.
*  That's like, I'm spinning.
*  So, yeah, I think everybody languishes.
*  And I aspire to do it less often, but not never.
*  Love it.
*  What does cursor, what is the root of cursor?
*  People look it up.
*  Hey folks, put it in the comments on YouTube.
*  I did look it up.
*  Oh good, okay, you'll tell us now.
*  No, I feel like there's a footnote in Hidden Potential
*  and I'm trying to remember.
*  It comes from Creret, I think.
*  And the cursor originally came,
*  nope, I don't wanna do it.
*  I'm gonna skip it, I don't remember.
*  This is, your hippocampus is smart enough
*  to have discarded that information.
*  And you have more important things to do.
*  Forgive me for asking the question.
*  Folks, put it in the comments on YouTube.
*  So good.
*  I have one more question about potential.
*  You have children, correct?
*  Three.
*  And a lot of our listeners either are children
*  or have children.
*  And even for those that don't have children,
*  I'm curious with the vast array of knowledge
*  that you now have about potential
*  and the fact that kids are these incredible sponges.
*  Right, I mean, they certainly experience discomfort.
*  We know that.
*  They are sponges.
*  We absolutely know that.
*  Sometimes they're filters.
*  We try and teach them to be filters
*  and hopefully they are imperfectionists.
*  Maybe there are kids that are just perfectionist by default,
*  but I have to imagine that they are
*  because standards come about when we become aware
*  of other people's performance, right?
*  What sorts of messages do you recommend parents
*  give their kids and what sorts of messages
*  are you actually implementing
*  that perhaps are different than you
*  were prior to researching and writing your book on potential?
*  Oh, interesting.
*  Well, the first thing I should say is
*  Becky Kennedy, Dr. Becky,
*  is my favorite source of insight on parenting.
*  And she's changed the way I think of,
*  the way I think about a lot of what I do with our kids.
*  But my wife, Allison,
*  her instincts about effective parenting are so sophisticated.
*  I feel like every day I learn something
*  from watching her communicate with our kids.
*  And so I came in thinking,
*  all right, I'm gonna write this book about potential.
*  I'm not gonna do a parenting chapter
*  because I want everything to be relevant to parents.
*  And sure enough, there's a chapter
*  that had nothing to do with parenting where I was like,
*  oh, actually, I'm reading this research
*  and there was a moment where I did something well
*  and I didn't even mean to do it.
*  And this is something that I think everyone
*  probably underutilizes.
*  I don't wanna actually, that's an overstatement.
*  I think a lot of people don't appreciate the importance
*  of this approach to parenting.
*  And I am trying to do it more often.
*  So quick story and then I'll back up into the principle.
*  So I was getting ready to give my first TED talk
*  a number of years ago, extremely nervous.
*  I'm a shy introvert.
*  I was for a long time afraid of public speaking.
*  I remember in college literally shaking
*  to raise my hand being that nervous.
*  And now I'm supposed to get in the red circle,
*  not my idea of comfort zone.
*  And I happened to mention to our oldest daughter
*  that I was nervous and I asked her for advice
*  on what I should do.
*  And she said, I think at the time,
*  let's see, she must have been,
*  she was seven maybe?
*  I think seven, maybe six.
*  Anyway, she said, look for a smiling face in the audience.
*  So it was one of those moments where I'm like,
*  oh, that's such a good idea.
*  Why didn't I think of that?
*  Yes, I can do that.
*  I know people who are gonna be in the audience.
*  So I asked a couple of friends to sit in the front rows
*  and I locked eyes with a couple of them
*  and my nerves went down a little bit.
*  So a couple of weeks later,
*  Joanna's getting ready to be in a school play
*  and she's also shy and introverted.
*  And she's nervous and she asks us for advice.
*  And instead of telling her what to do,
*  I said, well, what did you suggest to me a few weeks ago?
*  And she remembered and she said, look for a smiling face.
*  And it was one of the most moving moments of my life.
*  Like, Alison and I got to the play
*  and she looked at us and she beamed.
*  And I think what I learned from that experience was
*  kids need to feel that they matter.
*  And most of us think about mattering as,
*  showing kids that they're unconditionally loved
*  and giving them the support they need.
*  But we forget that part of feeling that you matter
*  is feeling that you make a difference.
*  So as a kid, feeling like you have something to contribute.
*  As a parent asking my daughter for advice,
*  that boosted her confidence.
*  And I think that this is,
*  I've come to call this the coach effect.
*  It's one of my favorite recent findings in psychology
*  that when you're struggling with something,
*  your instinct is to go to somebody else for advice
*  and say, I need guidance.
*  The problem is that keeps you in a passive frame of mind.
*  It makes you feel like you're dependent on others.
*  What you're better off doing is finding somebody else
*  with a similar challenge and giving them advice.
*  And what that does is it shows you
*  that you have something to give.
*  It boosts your efficacy.
*  The research on this by Lauren Eskris Winkler and colleagues
*  is fascinating.
*  So people who give advice instead of receiving it,
*  randomly assigned, end up more motivated and more confident.
*  And I think this is something every parent could do.
*  Whatever challenge you think your kid is gonna face,
*  find a version of it that you're grappling with
*  and seek their guidance on it.
*  And when they run into that same challenge,
*  they will have confidence
*  that they can begin to figure it out on their own.
*  And you can be a coach in that process
*  as opposed to just telling them what to do,
*  which they may feel like is not relevant
*  or they may resist because they don't wanna be told
*  what to do by a parent.
*  So that is my favorite parenting lesson
*  from Hidden Potential.
*  I love that.
*  And I love your statement that kids like adults
*  want to matter.
*  We hear make them feel important,
*  but so often that's tied to performance metrics.
*  And those performance metrics are the very things
*  that are making them nervous or that are creating anxiety.
*  I love it.
*  Are you taking additional kids for adoption?
*  Because I'm raising my hand.
*  I think there'd be a lot more developmental psychologists
*  in the world if we chose our careers later.
*  Super interesting topic.
*  And by the way, I'm very much looking forward
*  to reading your book, Hidden Potential.
*  Clearly I have a lot to resolve around that issue
*  because I still hear Ms. Rolfe in middle school
*  just telling me how much potential we have
*  and that I wasn't accessing mine.
*  Oh no, I'd say like a voice in the back of my head
*  all the time.
*  And even though I feel very happy
*  with many aspects of my life,
*  there are a lot of things that I want to do
*  that I haven't done.
*  And I think it's through,
*  what do they call it?
*  Limiting self beliefs or things of that sort.
*  Self limiting beliefs.
*  Self limiting beliefs.
*  There you go.
*  I can't even say the phrase.
*  Yeah, I do think all your fans are like,
*  yeah, that Andrew Huberman really hasn't,
*  he hasn't really tapped his potential at all.
*  He's squandering it all.
*  Well, keep in mind,
*  I've lived in a fairly narrow trench of pursuit.
*  At 19, I got into this and I've been doing this,
*  like researching and teaching and doing research.
*  Like it's pretty much all I've done
*  for like almost heading to 30 years.
*  So, and you too, you've been in this game for a long time.
*  And it's where we like to play.
*  But what I've learned from you today,
*  in addition to many other things,
*  is that realizing our potential has so much to do
*  with reaching outside.
*  We hear about our comfort zone,
*  but it's also reaching into our like deeper wishes
*  and thoughts.
*  And I keep coming back to this idea of the tag team podcast
*  and the origins of that in your mind.
*  It's like, I never would have expected that,
*  but it also reveals something
*  that sounds kind of like intrinsic to you.
*  Like maybe you like to see things play out
*  the way you think they should be played out,
*  as opposed to what's clearly a intractable battle
*  of loggerheads these days.
*  Yes, that's a core value.
*  Like I think that I can't imagine an unsolvable problem.
*  I love that.
*  Man, I want your brain.
*  Listen, Adam, I wanna thank you, first of all,
*  for taking the time today to come talk to us,
*  certainly not just about your book,
*  but we covered an enormous range of topics.
*  I mean, you talked to us about procrastination,
*  which is sort of the third rail of life for so many people,
*  creativity, intrinsic, extrinsic motivation,
*  blind spots, authenticity, and so much more.
*  But also I wanna thank you for being such an active teacher
*  on social media in the classroom.
*  You still run a research program.
*  You're doing TED Talks.
*  You're writing multiple books.
*  You're an absolute phenom in terms of the amount
*  of information that you're putting out into the world.
*  And I must say, I always, always, always learn
*  from your posts, your podcasts, your books.
*  Like there are certain people in the world
*  that are exceedingly rare, but you're one of them,
*  that when they open their mouth, people learn
*  and they learn valuable knowledge.
*  And it's an incredible thing to be on the receiving end.
*  And so I just wanna say on behalf of myself
*  and everyone else, thank you ever so much for what you do
*  and please keep going.
*  Well, thank you.
*  That means a lot to me considering the source
*  because the sentiments are mutual.
*  I think every time, whether it's reading one of your posts
*  or seeing one of your reels, my overwhelming thought is
*  that as a master teacher, and if I had been lucky enough
*  to take one of your classes, I might've gone more
*  of the neuroscience direction and then failed.
*  But it would've been interesting to learn more
*  about at minimum.
*  And I just have tremendous admiration for your commitment
*  to making science interesting, clear, and useful to people.
*  Thank you.
*  Well, I consider us on the same team in that regard.
*  And I probably will tap you about a potential collaboration.
*  It'd be so much fun to work together.
*  Meanwhile, again, thank you for everything you're doing.
*  And like I said, just keep going and please come back again.
*  I feel like there are a thousand other topics
*  we could talk about and that we should.
*  Honored.
*  We'll try not to make you regret that.
*  Thank you.
