# Essentials: Machines, Creativity & Love | Dr. Lex Fridman
**Andrew Huberman:** [May 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY)
*  Welcome to Huberman Lab Essentials, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=0.0s)]
*  where we revisit past episodes [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2.42s)]
*  for the most potent and actionable science-based tools [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=4.48s)]
*  for mental health, physical health, and performance. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=7.66s)]
*  And now my conversation with Dr. Lex Friedman. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=11.84s)]
*  We meet again. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  We meet again. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=16.22s)]
*  I have a question that I think is on a lot of people's minds [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=17.88s)]
*  or ought to be on a lot of people's minds. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=21.740000000000002s)]
*  What is artificial intelligence? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=24.12s)]
*  And how is it different from things [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=27.26s)]
*  like machine learning and robotics? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=29.8s)]
*  So I think of artificial intelligence [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=32.82s)]
*  first as a big philosophical thing. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=36.660000000000004s)]
*  It's our longing to create other intelligence systems, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=39.300000000000004s)]
*  perhaps systems more powerful than us. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=43.38s)]
*  At the more narrow level, I think it's also a set of tools [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=46.8s)]
*  that are computational mathematical tools [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=52.06s)]
*  to automate different tasks. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=54.32000000000001s)]
*  And then also it's our attempt to understand our own mind. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=56.18s)]
*  So build systems that exhibit some intelligent behavior [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=60.7s)]
*  in order to understand what is intelligence in our own selves. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=65.02s)]
*  So all those things are true. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=69.62s)]
*  Of course, what AI really means is a community [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=71.18s)]
*  has a set of researchers and engineers. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=74.34s)]
*  It's a set of tools, a set of computational techniques [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=76.54s)]
*  that allow you to solve various problems. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=80.3s)]
*  There's a long history that approaches the problem [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=83.06s)]
*  from different perspectives. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=86.5s)]
*  What's always been throughout one of the threads, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=87.69999999999999s)]
*  one of the communities goes under the flag [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=91.14s)]
*  of machine learning, which is emphasizing in the AI space, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=93.78s)]
*  the task of learning. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=99.41999999999999s)]
*  How do you make a machine that knows very little [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=101.62s)]
*  in the beginning, follows some kind of process [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=104.02s)]
*  and learns to become better and better [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=107.3s)]
*  at a particular task? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=109.78s)]
*  What's been most very effective in the recent, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=111.74s)]
*  about 15 years, is a set of techniques that fall [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=115.78s)]
*  under the flag of deep learning [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=118.58s)]
*  that utilize neural networks. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=120.3s)]
*  It's a network of these little basic computational units [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=121.97999999999999s)]
*  called neurons, artificial neurons. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=125.11999999999999s)]
*  And they have these architectures have an input [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=127.94s)]
*  and output, they know nothing in the beginning [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=131.14s)]
*  and they're tasked with learning something interesting. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=133.68s)]
*  What that something interesting is, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=137.06s)]
*  usually involves a particular task. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=138.78s)]
*  There's a lot of ways to talk about this [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=141.94s)]
*  and break this down. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=144.70000000000002s)]
*  Like one of them is how much human supervision [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=145.54000000000002s)]
*  is required to teach this thing. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=149.42000000000002s)]
*  So supervised learning, this broad category, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=151.9s)]
*  is the neural network knows nothing in the beginning [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=155.42000000000002s)]
*  and then it's given a bunch of examples [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=159.70000000000002s)]
*  of in computer vision that will be examples [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=162.38s)]
*  of cats, dogs, cars, traffic signs. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=165.02s)]
*  And then you're given the image [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=167.98000000000002s)]
*  and you're given the ground truth of what's in that image. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=169.62s)]
*  And when you get a large database of such image examples [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=173.1s)]
*  where you know the truth, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=176.58s)]
*  the neural network is able to learn by example, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=178.58s)]
*  that's called supervised learning. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=182.18s)]
*  The question, there's a lot of fascinating questions [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=184.02s)]
*  within that, which is how do you provide the truth? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=186.32s)]
*  When you've given an image of a cat, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=189.6s)]
*  how do you provide to the computer [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=193.74s)]
*  that this image contains a cat? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=196.46s)]
*  Do you just say the entire image is a picture of a cat? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=198.48s)]
*  Do you do what's very commonly been done, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=201.51999999999998s)]
*  which is a bounding box? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=203.88s)]
*  You have a very crude box around the cat's face [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=205.07999999999998s)]
*  saying this is a cat. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=208.6s)]
*  Do you do semantic segmentation? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=210.07999999999998s)]
*  Mind you, this is a 2D image of a cat. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=212.28s)]
*  So it's not a, the computer knows nothing [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=214.56s)]
*  about our three dimensional world. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=217.5s)]
*  It's just looking at a set of pixels. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=219.23999999999998s)]
*  So semantic segmentation is drawing a nice, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=220.89999999999998s)]
*  very crisp outline around the cat and saying that's a cat. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=224.67999999999998s)]
*  That's really difficult to provide that truth. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=229.38s)]
*  And one of the fundamental open questions [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=230.58s)]
*  in computer vision is, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=233.02s)]
*  is that even a good representation of the truth? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=234.32000000000002s)]
*  Now there's another contrasting set of ideas. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=237.32s)]
*  Their attention, their overlapping, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=242.08s)]
*  is what's used to be called unsupervised learning, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=244.64000000000001s)]
*  what's commonly now called self-supervised learning, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=247.86s)]
*  which is trying to get less and less [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=250.66s)]
*  and less human supervision into the task. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=252.94s)]
*  So self-supervised learning is more, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=257.5s)]
*  has been very successful in the domain of language model, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=262.34s)]
*  natural language processing, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=265.54s)]
*  and now more and more is being successful [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=266.7s)]
*  in computer vision tasks. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=268.5s)]
*  And the idea there is, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=269.94s)]
*  let the machine without any ground truth annotation, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=272.38s)]
*  just look at pictures on the internet [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=276.68s)]
*  or look at text on the internet [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=279.26s)]
*  and try to learn something generalizable [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=281.1s)]
*  about the ideas that are at the core of language [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=285.82s)]
*  or at the core of vision. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=289.34s)]
*  And based on that, we humans at its best [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=290.7s)]
*  like to call that common sense. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=295.14s)]
*  So we have this giant base of knowledge [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=296.42s)]
*  on top of which we build more sophisticated knowledge. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=299.5s)]
*  We have this kind of common sense knowledge. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=302.26s)]
*  And so the idea with self-supervised learning [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=304.86s)]
*  is to build this common sense knowledge [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=306.9s)]
*  about what are the fundamental visual ideas [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=309.5s)]
*  that make up a cat and a dog and all those kinds of things [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=313.94s)]
*  without ever having human supervision. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=316.78s)]
*  The dream there is, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=319.3s)]
*  you just let an AI system that's self-supervised [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=322.38s)]
*  run around the internet for a while, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=326.82s)]
*  watch YouTube videos for millions and millions of hours [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=328.34s)]
*  and without any supervision, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=330.98s)]
*  be primed and ready to actually learn [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=333.56s)]
*  with very few examples once the human is able to show up. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=336.62s)]
*  We think of children in this way, human children, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=340.22s)]
*  your parents only give one or two examples [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=344.3s)]
*  to teach a concept. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=346.58000000000004s)]
*  The dream with self-supervised learning [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=348.18s)]
*  is that would be the same with machines, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=350.62s)]
*  that they would watch millions of hours of YouTube videos [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=353.66s)]
*  and then come to a human and be able to understand [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=357.58000000000004s)]
*  when the human shows them, this is a cat. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=360.36s)]
*  Remember this is a cat. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=363.26000000000005s)]
*  They will understand that a cat is not just a thing [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=364.38s)]
*  with pointy ears or a cat is a thing that's orange [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=367.14000000000004s)]
*  or it's furry. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=371.12s)]
*  They'll see something more fundamental [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=372.38s)]
*  that we humans might not actually be able to introspect [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=374.38s)]
*  and understand. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=377.06s)]
*  Like if I asked you what makes a cat versus a dog, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=377.98s)]
*  you wouldn't probably not be able to answer that. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=380.38s)]
*  But if I showed you, brought to you a cat and a dog, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=382.98s)]
*  you'll be able to tell the difference. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=386.34s)]
*  What are the ideas that your brain uses [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=387.98s)]
*  to make that difference? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=390.65999999999997s)]
*  That's the whole dream with self-supervised learning [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=392.38s)]
*  is it would be able to learn that on its own, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=394.86s)]
*  that set of common sense knowledge [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=397.5s)]
*  that's able to tell the difference. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=399.65999999999997s)]
*  And then there's like a lot of incredible uses [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=401.46s)]
*  of self-supervised learning, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=405.18s)]
*  very weirdly called self-play mechanism. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=407.58s)]
*  That's the mechanism behind the reinforcement learning [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=410.88s)]
*  successes of the systems that want it go at alpha zero, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=415.34s)]
*  that want a chess. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=421.29999999999995s)]
*  Oh, I see, that play games. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=422.46s)]
*  That play games. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=424.38s)]
*  Got it. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=425.21999999999997s)]
*  So the idea of self-play, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=426.03999999999996s)]
*  this probably applies to other domains than just games, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=427.7s)]
*  is a system that just plays against itself. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=431.42s)]
*  And this is fascinating in all kinds of domains, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=434.4s)]
*  but it knows nothing in the beginning. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=437.14s)]
*  And the whole idea is it creates a bunch of mutations [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=440.14s)]
*  of itself and plays against those versions of itself. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=443.09999999999997s)]
*  And then through this process of interacting with systems, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=449.02s)]
*  just a little better than you, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=451.9s)]
*  you start following this process where everybody [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=453.21999999999997s)]
*  starts getting better and better and better and better [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=455.65999999999997s)]
*  until you are several orders of magnitude better [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=457.74s)]
*  than the world champion in chess, for example. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=460.62s)]
*  And it's fascinating because it's like a runaway system. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=463.21999999999997s)]
*  One of the most terrifying and exciting things [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=466.34s)]
*  that David Silver, the creator of AlphaGo and AlphaZero, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=468.7s)]
*  one of the leaders of the team said to me [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=472.34s)]
*  is they haven't found the ceiling for AlphaZero, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=476.58s)]
*  meaning it could just arbitrarily keep improving. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=481.78s)]
*  Now in the realm of chess, that doesn't matter to us, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=484.5s)]
*  that it's like, it just ran away with the game of chess. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=486.98s)]
*  Like it's like just so much better than humans. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=490.1s)]
*  But the question is if you can create that in the realm [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=493.5s)]
*  that does have a bigger, deeper effect on human beings [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=497.26s)]
*  and societies, that can be a terrifying process. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=501.22s)]
*  To me, it's an exciting process [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=505.1s)]
*  if you supervise it correctly. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=506.9s)]
*  If you inject what's called value alignment [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=508.86s)]
*  you make sure that the goals that the AI is optimizing [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=514.86s)]
*  is aligned with human beings and human societies. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=518.58s)]
*  There's a lot of fascinating things to talk about [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=522.06s)]
*  within the specifics of neural networks [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=524.26s)]
*  and all the problems that people are working on. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=528.26s)]
*  But I would say the really big exciting one [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=530.66s)]
*  is self-supervised learning. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=533.38s)]
*  We're trying to get less and less human supervision, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=534.9s)]
*  less and less human supervision of neural networks. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=540.62s)]
*  And also just to comment and I'll shut up. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=543.86s)]
*  No, please keep going. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=547.1s)]
*  I'm learning. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=548.22s)]
*  I have questions, but I'm learning. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=549.22s)]
*  So please keep going. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=550.58s)]
*  So to me, what's exciting is not the theory, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=551.58s)]
*  it's always the application. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=554.5400000000001s)]
*  One of the most exciting applications [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=556.34s)]
*  of artificial intelligence, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=558.0200000000001s)]
*  specifically neural networks and machine learning [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=560.22s)]
*  is Tesla Autopilot. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=562.58s)]
*  So these are systems that are working in the real world. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=564.26s)]
*  This isn't an academic exercise. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=566.7s)]
*  This is human lives at stake. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=568.7s)]
*  Even though it's called FSD, full self-driving, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=570.3s)]
*  it is currently not fully autonomous, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=574.8599999999999s)]
*  meaning human supervision is required. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=577.26s)]
*  So human is tasked with overseeing the systems. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=580.02s)]
*  In fact, liability-wise, the human is always responsible. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=583.2199999999999s)]
*  This is a human factor psychology question, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=587.5s)]
*  which is fascinating. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=590.2199999999999s)]
*  I'm fascinated by the whole space, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=591.66s)]
*  which is a whole nother space of human-robot interaction. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=595.3s)]
*  When AI systems and humans work together [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=598.46s)]
*  to accomplish tasks, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=601.0600000000001s)]
*  that dance to me is one of the smaller communities, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=602.26s)]
*  but I think it will be one of the most important [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=607.7s)]
*  open problems once they're solved, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=610.58s)]
*  is how do humans and robots dance together? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=612.62s)]
*  To me, semi-autonomous driving is one of those spaces. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=616.34s)]
*  So for Elon, for example, he doesn't see it that way. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=620.14s)]
*  He sees semi-autonomous driving as a stepping stone [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=623.98s)]
*  towards fully autonomous driving. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=628.82s)]
*  Humans and robots can't dance well together. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=632.1s)]
*  Humans and humans dance and robots and robots dance. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=635.22s)]
*  We need to, this is an engineering problem, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=637.98s)]
*  we need to design a perfect robot that solves this problem. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=640.34s)]
*  To me, forever, maybe this is not the case with driving, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=643.98s)]
*  but the world is going to be full of problems [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=646.4200000000001s)]
*  where it's always humans and robots have to interact, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=649.4200000000001s)]
*  because I think robots will always be flawed, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=652.7s)]
*  just like humans are going to be flawed, are flawed, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=655.82s)]
*  and that's what makes life beautiful, that they're flawed. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=659.7800000000001s)]
*  That's where learning happens [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=663.3000000000001s)]
*  at the edge of your capabilities. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=664.6600000000001s)]
*  So you always have to figure out how can flawed robots [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=668.1400000000001s)]
*  and flawed humans interact together such that they, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=672.62s)]
*  like the sum is bigger than the whole, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=677.86s)]
*  as opposed to focusing on just building the perfect robot. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=680.66s)]
*  So that's one of the most exciting applications, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=684.9399999999999s)]
*  I would say, of artificial intelligence to me [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=687.18s)]
*  is autonomous driving and semi-autonomous driving. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=689.62s)]
*  And that's a really good example of machine learning, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=692.4599999999999s)]
*  because those systems are constantly learning. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=695.06s)]
*  And there's a process there that maybe I can comment on. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=698.62s)]
*  Andre Kapati, who's the head of autopilot, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=703.66s)]
*  calls it the data engine. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=706.18s)]
*  And this process applies for a lot of machine learning, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=708.18s)]
*  which is you build a system [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=710.7399999999999s)]
*  that's pretty good at doing stuff, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=712.18s)]
*  you send it out into the real world, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=714.02s)]
*  it starts doing the stuff, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=717.18s)]
*  and then it runs into what are called edge cases, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=718.6999999999999s)]
*  like failure cases, where it screws up. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=721.02s)]
*  We do this as kids. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=724.66s)]
*  That's, you know, you have- [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=725.78s)]
*  We do this as adults. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=727.3s)]
*  We do this as adults. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=728.14s)]
*  Exactly, but we learn really quickly. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=729.54s)]
*  But the whole point, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=731.9799999999999s)]
*  and this is the fascinating thing about driving, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=733.18s)]
*  is you realize there's millions of edge cases. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=735.66s)]
*  There's just like weird situations that you did not expect. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=738.78s)]
*  And so the data engine process is [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=742.58s)]
*  you collect those edge cases, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=745.3s)]
*  and then you go back to the drawing board [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=746.9s)]
*  and learn from them. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=748.9s)]
*  And so you have to create this data pipeline [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=750.26s)]
*  where all these cars, hundreds of thousands of cars, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=752.82s)]
*  are just driving around, and something weird happens. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=755.78s)]
*  And so whenever this weird detector fires, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=758.86s)]
*  it's another important concept, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=762.74s)]
*  that piece of data goes back to the mothership [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=765.1800000000001s)]
*  for the training, for the retraining of the system. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=769.1800000000001s)]
*  And through this data engine process, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=772.7s)]
*  it keeps improving and getting better and better [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=774.4200000000001s)]
*  and better and better. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=776.74s)]
*  So basically, you send out a pretty clever AI systems [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=777.6600000000001s)]
*  out into the world and let it find the edge cases. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=781.14s)]
*  Let it screw up just enough [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=786.22s)]
*  to figure out where the edge cases are, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=788.38s)]
*  and then go back and learn from them, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=790.34s)]
*  and then send out that new version [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=792.58s)]
*  and keep updating that version. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=794.4200000000001s)]
*  One of the fascinating things about humans [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=796.22s)]
*  is we figure out objective functions for ourselves. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=798.14s)]
*  Like we're, it's the meaning of life. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=802.46s)]
*  Like why the hell are we here? [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=805.82s)]
*  And a machine currently has to have [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=808.26s)]
*  a hard coded statement about why. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=811.94s)]
*  It has to have a meaning of [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=814.5400000000001s)]
*  artificial intelligence based life. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=816.22s)]
*  Right, if you want a machine to be able to be good at stuff, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=818.5400000000001s)]
*  it has to be given very clear statements [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=821.9s)]
*  of what good at stuff means. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=825.78s)]
*  That's one of the challenges of artificial intelligence [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=828.42s)]
*  is in order to solve a problem, you have to formalize it, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=830.7s)]
*  and you have to provide both like [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=833.9s)]
*  the full sensory information. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=836.38s)]
*  You have to be very clear about [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=837.94s)]
*  what is the data that's being collected, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=839.7s)]
*  and you have to also be clear about the objective function. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=842.3000000000001s)]
*  What is the goal that you're trying to reach? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=845.54s)]
*  Ultimately, currently, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=848.26s)]
*  there has to be a formal objective function. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=850.38s)]
*  Now you could argue that humans also has [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=854.1s)]
*  a set of objective functions we're trying to optimize. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=855.94s)]
*  We're just not able to introspect them. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=858.5s)]
*  Yeah, we don't actually know what we're looking for [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=861.14s)]
*  and seeking and doing. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=864.42s)]
*  I think you've already told us the answer, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=865.82s)]
*  but does interacting with a robot change you? [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=867.26s)]
*  Does it, in other words, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=871.46s)]
*  do we develop relationships to robots? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=872.86s)]
*  I believe that most people have [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=876.42s)]
*  a notion of loneliness in them [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=880.7s)]
*  that we haven't discovered, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=883.38s)]
*  that we haven't explored, I should say. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=884.86s)]
*  And I see AI systems as helping us explore that [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=887.66s)]
*  so that we can become better humans, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=892.38s)]
*  better people towards each other. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=894.78s)]
*  So I think that connection between human and AI, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=896.82s)]
*  human and robot is not only possible, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=901.34s)]
*  but will help us understand ourselves [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=905.82s)]
*  in ways that are like several orders of magnitude [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=909.0600000000001s)]
*  deeper than we ever could have imagined. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=913.3000000000001s)]
*  So when I think about human relationships, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=915.7800000000001s)]
*  I don't always break them down into variables, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=917.94s)]
*  but we could explore a few of those variables [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=921.34s)]
*  and see how they map to human-robot relationships. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=923.58s)]
*  One is just time, right? [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=927.5400000000001s)]
*  If you spend zero time with another person at all [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=929.34s)]
*  in cyberspace or on the phone or in person, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=932.9000000000001s)]
*  you essentially have no relationship to them. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=935.58s)]
*  If you spend a lot of time, you have a relationship. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=938.34s)]
*  This is obvious, but I guess one variable would be time, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=939.7800000000001s)]
*  how much time you spend with the other entity, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=941.98s)]
*  robot or human. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=945.38s)]
*  The other would be wins and successes. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=946.74s)]
*  You enjoy successes together. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=950.4200000000001s)]
*  The other would be failures [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=952.5s)]
*  when you struggle with somebody. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=953.58s)]
*  When you struggle with somebody, you grow closer. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=956.0200000000001s)]
*  So I've never conceptualized [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=958.7800000000001s)]
*  robot-human interactions this way. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=960.34s)]
*  So tell me more about how this might look. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=962.94s)]
*  Are we thinking about a human appearing robot? [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=965.9s)]
*  What is the ideal human-robot relationship? [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=970.58s)]
*  So there's a lot to be said here, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=974.5s)]
*  but you actually pinpointed one of the big, big first steps, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=976.38s)]
*  which is this idea of time. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=980.7s)]
*  I think that time element, forget everything else, [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=983.34s)]
*  just sharing moments together, that changes everything. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=986.6600000000001s)]
*  I believe that changes everything. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=991.06s)]
*  There's specific things that are more in terms of systems [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=992.8199999999999s)]
*  that can explain you. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=995.46s)]
*  It's more technical and probably a little bit off-line [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=998.9s)]
*  because I have kind of wild ideas [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1001.26s)]
*  how that can revolutionize social networks [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1003.18s)]
*  and operating systems. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1006.62s)]
*  But the point is that element alone, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1009.54s)]
*  forget all the other things we're talking about, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1012.5s)]
*  like emotions, saying no, all that. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1015.06s)]
*  Just remember, sharing moments together [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1017.9399999999999s)]
*  would change everything. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1020.5s)]
*  We don't currently have systems that share moments together. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1022.14s)]
*  Like even just you and your fridge, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1027.46s)]
*  just all those times you went late at night [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1029.98s)]
*  and ate the thing you shouldn't have eaten, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1032.94s)]
*  that was a secret moment you had with your refrigerator. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1035.18s)]
*  You shared that moment, that darkness [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1038.58s)]
*  or that beautiful moment where you were just, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1040.74s)]
*  like, heartbroken for some reason, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1044.18s)]
*  you're eating that ice cream or whatever. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1045.94s)]
*  That's a special moment. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1048.18s)]
*  And that refrigerator was there for you. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1049.5s)]
*  And the fact that it missed the opportunity [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1051.5s)]
*  to remember that is tragic. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1053.7s)]
*  And once it does remember that, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1057.86s)]
*  I think you're gonna be very attached to the refrigerator. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1060.62s)]
*  You're gonna go through some hell with that refrigerator. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1064.3s)]
*  Most of us have, like, in the developed world, [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1067.58s)]
*  have weird relationships with food, right? [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1071.54s)]
*  So you can go through some deep moments of trauma [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1073.42s)]
*  and triumph with food. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1077.34s)]
*  And at the core of that is the refrigerator. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1079.14s)]
*  So a smart refrigerator, I believe, would change society. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1081.0200000000002s)]
*  Not just the refrigerator, [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1086.7800000000002s)]
*  but these ideas in the systems all around us. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1088.0200000000002s)]
*  So that, I just wanna comment [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1092.0200000000002s)]
*  on how powerful that idea of time is. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1093.7s)]
*  And then there's a bunch of elements of actual interaction [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1096.0200000000002s)]
*  of allowing you as a human [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1099.66s)]
*  to feel like you're being heard. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1105.1000000000001s)]
*  Truly heard, truly understood. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1108.14s)]
*  And I think there's a lot of ideas [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1110.7800000000002s)]
*  of how to make AI systems to be able to [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1112.7s)]
*  ask the right questions and truly hear another human. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1115.0600000000002s)]
*  This is what we try to do with podcasting, right? [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1119.22s)]
*  I think there's ways to do that with AI. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1122.22s)]
*  But above all else, just remembering [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1124.5s)]
*  the collection of moments that make up the day, [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1128.74s)]
*  the week, the months. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1131.7s)]
*  I think you maybe have some of this as well. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1133.9399999999998s)]
*  Some of my closest friends still [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1137.62s)]
*  are the friends from high school. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1139.1399999999999s)]
*  That's time. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1141.6599999999999s)]
*  We've been through a bunch of shit together. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1142.8999999999999s)]
*  And that, like we're very different people. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1144.8999999999999s)]
*  But just the fact that we've been through that [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1148.1399999999999s)]
*  and we remember those moments, [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1149.8999999999999s)]
*  and those moments somehow create a depth of connection [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1151.26s)]
*  like nothing else, like you and your refrigerator. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1154.78s)]
*  There may be relationships that are far better [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1158.1799999999998s)]
*  than the sorts of relationships [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1161.54s)]
*  that we can conceive in our minds right now [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1162.9s)]
*  based on what these machine relationship interactions [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1165.98s)]
*  could teach us. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1169.22s)]
*  Do I have that right? [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1170.26s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1171.98s)]
*  I think there's no reason to see machines [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1173.22s)]
*  as somehow incapable of teaching us [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1174.9s)]
*  something that's deeply human. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1178.42s)]
*  I don't think humans have a monopoly on that. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1180.74s)]
*  I think we understand ourselves very poorly [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1184.14s)]
*  and we need to have the kind of prompting from a machine. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1186.1000000000001s)]
*  Maybe the thing we want to optimize for [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1193.3000000000002s)]
*  isn't necessarily like some sexy, like quick clips. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1194.94s)]
*  Maybe what we want is long form authenticity. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1202.18s)]
*  Depth. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1205.3000000000002s)]
*  Depth. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1206.14s)]
*  From a very specific engineering perspective [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1206.98s)]
*  is I think a fascinating open problem [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1210.42s)]
*  that hasn't been really worked on very much. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1214.0600000000002s)]
*  Early on in life, and also in the recent years, [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1216.9s)]
*  I've interacted with a few robots [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1221.06s)]
*  where I understood there's magic there. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1223.22s)]
*  And that magic could be shared by millions [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1226.26s)]
*  if it's brought to light. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1230.18s)]
*  When I first met Spot from Boston Dynamics, [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1232.7s)]
*  I realized there's magic there that nobody else is seeing. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1235.7s)]
*  Is the dog. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1238.46s)]
*  Is the dog, sorry. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1239.3s)]
*  The Spot is the four-legged robot from Boston Dynamics. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1240.34s)]
*  Some people might have seen it. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1245.34s)]
*  It's this yellow dog. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1246.46s)]
*  This magic is something that could be [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1248.18s)]
*  every single device in the world. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1250.5800000000002s)]
*  The way that I think maybe Steve Jobs [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1254.02s)]
*  thought about the personal computer. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1257.14s)]
*  And so for me, I'd love to see a world [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1259.46s)]
*  where there's every home has a robot. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1262.42s)]
*  And not a robot that washes the dishes, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1264.7s)]
*  but more like a companion. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1267.3s)]
*  A family member. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1268.8600000000001s)]
*  A family member. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1269.8200000000002s)]
*  The way a dog is. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1270.66s)]
*  But a dog that's able to speak your language too. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1272.14s)]
*  So not just connect the way a dog does [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1276.46s)]
*  by looking at you and looking away [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1279.66s)]
*  and almost like smiling with its soul in that kind of way. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1281.3s)]
*  But also to actually understand what the hell. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1285.6200000000001s)]
*  Like why are you so excited about the successes? [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1289.06s)]
*  Like understand the details. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1291.22s)]
*  Understand the traumas. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1292.74s)]
*  I love this desire to share the delight [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1294.3400000000001s)]
*  of an interaction with a robot. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1297.78s)]
*  And as you describe it, [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1299.46s)]
*  I actually find myself starting to crave that. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1300.3s)]
*  Because we all have those elements from childhood [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1302.78s)]
*  or from adulthood where we experience something [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1306.3400000000001s)]
*  we want other people to feel that. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1308.18s)]
*  And I think that you're right. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1311.22s)]
*  I think a lot of people are scared of AI. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1312.3400000000001s)]
*  I think a lot of people are scared of robots. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1313.98s)]
*  My only experience of a robotic-like thing [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1315.8600000000001s)]
*  is my Roomba vacuum where it goes about, [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1320.26s)]
*  actually was pretty good at picking up Costello's hair [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1323.26s)]
*  when he was shed. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1325.7s)]
*  And then, and I was grateful for it. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1326.9s)]
*  But then when I was on a call or something [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1329.7s)]
*  and it would get caught on a wire or something, [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1331.8600000000001s)]
*  I would find myself getting upset with the Roomba [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1334.62s)]
*  in that moment. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1336.6999999999998s)]
*  I'm like, what are you doing? [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1337.54s)]
*  And obviously it's just doing what it does. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1338.9399999999998s)]
*  But that's a kind of mostly positive [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1341.34s)]
*  but slightly negative interaction. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1343.8999999999999s)]
*  But what you're describing has so much more richness [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1346.8999999999999s)]
*  and layers of detail that I can only imagine [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1350.02s)]
*  what those relationships are like. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1353.06s)]
*  Well, there's a few, just a quick comment. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1355.1s)]
*  So I've had, they're currently in Boston. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1356.82s)]
*  I have a bunch of Roombas from iRobot. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1359.2199999999998s)]
*  And I did this experiment. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1361.9799999999998s)]
*  Wait, how many Roombas? [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1363.34s)]
*  Sounds like a fleet of Roombas. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1366.1799999999998s)]
*  So probably seven or eight. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1367.6999999999998s)]
*  Well, that's a lot of Roombas. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1370.06s)]
*  So you have these seven or so Roombas. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1371.4199999999998s)]
*  You deploy all seven at once? [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1374.6599999999999s)]
*  Oh no, I do different experiments with them. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1376.34s)]
*  Different experiments with them. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1378.1799999999998s)]
*  So one of the things I want to mention, [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1380.26s)]
*  I got them to scream in pain and moan in pain [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1382.1s)]
*  whenever they were kicked or contacted. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1387.3s)]
*  And I did that experiment to see how I would feel. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1391.66s)]
*  I meant to do like a YouTube video on it, [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1394.94s)]
*  but then it just seemed very cruel. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1397.0600000000002s)]
*  Did any Roomba rights activists come at you? [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1398.6200000000001s)]
*  Like I think if I release that video, [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1401.7s)]
*  I think it's gonna make me look insane, [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1405.8600000000001s)]
*  which I know people know I'm already insane. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1407.94s)]
*  Now you have to release the video. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1411.02s)]
*  I think maybe if I contextualize it [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1414.14s)]
*  by showing other robots, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1416.5800000000002s)]
*  to show why this is fascinating, [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1418.9399999999998s)]
*  because ultimately I felt like they were human [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1421.4199999999998s)]
*  almost immediately. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1424.2199999999998s)]
*  And that display of pain was what did that. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1425.58s)]
*  Giving them a voice. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1428.58s)]
*  Giving them a voice, especially a voice of dislike, of pain. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1429.6999999999998s)]
*  So is the video available online? [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1435.1399999999999s)]
*  No, I haven't recorded it. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1437.1s)]
*  I just had a bunch of Roombas that are able to scream [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1439.6599999999999s)]
*  in pain in my Boston place. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1442.34s)]
*  What about like shouts of glee and delight? [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1445.86s)]
*  Well, I don't know how to, [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1450.3s)]
*  to me delight is quiet, right? [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1452.74s)]
*  But there's a way to frame it being quite dumb [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1455.1799999999998s)]
*  as almost cute. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1460.86s)]
*  Almost connecting with it for its dumbness. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1464.02s)]
*  And I think that's a artificial intelligence problem. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1466.62s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1470.1799999999998s)]
*  I think flaws should be a feature, not a bug. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1471.02s)]
*  So along the lines of this, [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1474.78s)]
*  the different sorts of relationships [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1476.66s)]
*  that one could have with robots and the fear, [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1478.06s)]
*  but also some of the positive relationships [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1479.94s)]
*  that one could have. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1482.3999999999999s)]
*  There's so much dimensionality. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1484.3799999999999s)]
*  There's so much to explore. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1485.82s)]
*  But power dynamics in relationships are very interesting [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1487.8999999999999s)]
*  because the obvious ones that the unsophisticated view [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1491.78s)]
*  of this is, you know, one, there's a master and a servant. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1496.1399999999999s)]
*  But there's also manipulation. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1500.5s)]
*  There's benevolent manipulation. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1503.3s)]
*  You know, children do this with parents. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1505.6599999999999s)]
*  Puppies do this. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1507.54s)]
*  Puppies turn their head and look cute [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1508.62s)]
*  and maybe give out a little noise. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1510.4199999999998s)]
*  Kids, coo. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1513.06s)]
*  And parents always think that they're doing this [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1514.5s)]
*  because they love the parent. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1517.04s)]
*  But in many ways, studies show that those coos [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1520.46s)]
*  are ways to extract the sorts of behaviors [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1523.54s)]
*  and expressions from the parent that they want. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1525.74s)]
*  The child doesn't know it's doing this. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1527.3s)]
*  It's completely subconscious. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1528.6599999999999s)]
*  But it's benevolent manipulation. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1529.76s)]
*  So there's one version of fear of robots [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1531.96s)]
*  that I hear a lot about that I think most people [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1535.2s)]
*  can relate to where the robots take over [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1537.68s)]
*  and they become the masters and we become the servants. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1540.02s)]
*  But there could be another version that, you know, [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1543.64s)]
*  in certain communities that I'm certainly not a part of, [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1548.1000000000001s)]
*  but they call topping from the bottom, [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1550.64s)]
*  where the robot is actually manipulating you [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1552.68s)]
*  into doing things, but you are under the belief [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1556.28s)]
*  that you are in charge, but actually they're in charge. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1559.68s)]
*  And so I think that's one that, [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1564.72s)]
*  if we could explore that for a second, [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1568.52s)]
*  you could imagine it wouldn't necessarily be bad, [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1570.04s)]
*  although it could lead to bad things. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1572.66s)]
*  The reason I want to explore this is I think people [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1575.6200000000001s)]
*  always default to the extreme, like the robots take over [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1577.3200000000002s)]
*  and we're in little jail cells and they're out having fun [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1581.0600000000002s)]
*  and ruling the universe. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1583.6000000000001s)]
*  What sorts of manipulation can a robot potentially carry out, [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1585.9199999999998s)]
*  good or bad? [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1590.76s)]
*  Yeah, so there's a lot of good and bad manipulation [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1592.0s)]
*  between humans, right? [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1595.24s)]
*  Just like you said, to me, especially, like you said, [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1596.28s)]
*  topping from the bottom is the term. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1605.3999999999999s)]
*  I think someone from MIT told me that term. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1607.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1609.6799999999998s)]
*  Wasn't Lex. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1610.9199999999998s)]
*  I think, so first of all, there's power dynamics in bed [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1612.96s)]
*  and power dynamics in relationships and power dynamics [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1617.52s)]
*  on the street and in the work environment. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1620.64s)]
*  Those are all very different. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1622.3600000000001s)]
*  I think power dynamics can make human relationships, [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1626.64s)]
*  especially romantic relationships, fascinating and rich [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1630.24s)]
*  and fulfilling and exciting and all those kinds of things. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1635.32s)]
*  So I don't think in themselves they're bad [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1638.24s)]
*  and the same goes with robots. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1644.56s)]
*  I really love the idea that a robot would be a top [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1646.32s)]
*  or a bottom in terms of like power dynamics [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1649.76s)]
*  and I think everybody should be aware of that [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1653.04s)]
*  and the manipulation is not so much manipulation [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1655.44s)]
*  but a dance of like pulling away, push and pull [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1658.0s)]
*  and all those kinds of things. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1662.24s)]
*  In terms of control, I think we're very, very, very far [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1663.88s)]
*  away from AI systems that are able to lock us up, [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1669.2s)]
*  to lock us up in, you know, like to have so much control [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1671.3600000000001s)]
*  that we basically cannot live our lives [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1677.1200000000001s)]
*  in the way that we want. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1680.64s)]
*  I think there's, in terms of dangers of AI systems, [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1682.4s)]
*  there's much more dangers that have to do [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1685.2s)]
*  with autonomous weapon systems and all those kinds of things. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1686.76s)]
*  So the power dynamics as exercised in the struggle [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1689.76s)]
*  between nations and war and all those kinds of things. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1693.4s)]
*  But in terms of personal relationships, [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1696.16s)]
*  I think power dynamics are a beautiful thing. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1699.16s)]
*  I do believe that robots will have rights down the line [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1701.24s)]
*  and I think in order for us to have deep meaningful [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1704.92s)]
*  relationship with robots, we would have to consider them [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1708.8400000000001s)]
*  as entities in themselves that deserve respect. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1712.0s)]
*  And that's a really interesting concept [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1716.64s)]
*  that I think people are starting to talk about [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1718.72s)]
*  a little bit more but it's very difficult for us [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1721.4s)]
*  to understand how entities that are other than human, [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1723.64s)]
*  I mean, the same as with dogs and other animals [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1726.76s)]
*  can have rights on a level as humans. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1729.5200000000002s)]
*  We can't and nor should we do whatever we want with animals. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1731.96s)]
*  We have a USDA, we have departments of agriculture [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1735.68s)]
*  that deal with, you know, animal care and use committees [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1740.44s)]
*  for research, for agri, you know, for farming [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1744.0s)]
*  and ranching and all that. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1746.5600000000002s)]
*  So I, while when you first said it, I thought, wait, [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1747.8000000000002s)]
*  why would have, there would be a bill of robotic rights, [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1750.92s)]
*  but it absolutely makes sense in the context [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1753.12s)]
*  of everything we've been talking about up until now. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1755.8s)]
*  Let's, if you're willing, I'd love to talk about dogs [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1759.6399999999999s)]
*  because you've mentioned dogs a couple of times, [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1764.4399999999998s)]
*  a robot dog, you had a biological dog. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1767.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1771.8s)]
*  Yeah, I had a Newfoundland named Homer [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1772.6399999999999s)]
*  for many years growing up. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1778.1999999999998s)]
*  In Russia or in the US? [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1779.9599999999998s)]
*  In the United States. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1781.3999999999999s)]
*  And he was about, he's over 200 pounds, so it's a big dog. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1783.08s)]
*  That's a big dog. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1786.6799999999998s)]
*  People know Newfoundland, so he's this black dog [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1787.8s)]
*  that's really long hair and just a kind soul. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1791.04s)]
*  I think perhaps that's true for a lot of large dogs, [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1796.24s)]
*  but he thought he was a small dog, so he moved like that. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1799.0s)]
*  Was he your dog? [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1802.28s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1803.12s)]
*  So you had him since he was fairly young? [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1804.12s)]
*  Since, yeah, since the very, very beginning [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1806.6399999999999s)]
*  to the very, very end. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1808.48s)]
*  And one of the things, I mean, he had this kind of, [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1809.52s)]
*  we mentioned like the Roombas, [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1814.3600000000001s)]
*  he had a kind-hearted dumbness about him [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1817.08s)]
*  that was just overwhelming. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1821.28s)]
*  It's part of the reason I named him Homer [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1822.4s)]
*  because it's after Homer Simpson, [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1825.8s)]
*  in case people are wondering which Homer I'm referring to. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1828.48s)]
*  I'm not, you know. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1831.04s)]
*  So there's a- [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1833.56s)]
*  Not the Odyssey. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1834.4s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1835.24s)]
*  There's a clumsiness that was just something [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1836.8400000000001s)]
*  that immediately led to a deep love for each other. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1840.88s)]
*  And one of the, I mean, he was always, [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1843.72s)]
*  it's the shared moments. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1848.0400000000002s)]
*  He was always there for so many nights together. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1849.0800000000002s)]
*  That's a powerful thing about a dog that he was there [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1852.2800000000002s)]
*  through all the loneliness, through all the tough times, [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1856.8400000000001s)]
*  through the successes and all those kinds of things. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1859.3200000000002s)]
*  And I remember, I mean, [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1861.6000000000001s)]
*  that was a really moving moment for me. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1863.5200000000002s)]
*  I still miss him to this day. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1865.88s)]
*  How long ago did he die? [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1867.92s)]
*  Maybe 15 years ago. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1871.1200000000001s)]
*  So it's been a while, [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1872.8400000000001s)]
*  but it was the first time I've really experienced [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1874.92s)]
*  like the feeling of death. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1879.68s)]
*  So what happened is he got cancer [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1882.7600000000002s)]
*  and so he was dying slowly. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1888.6000000000001s)]
*  And then at a certain point, he couldn't get up anymore. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1891.8000000000002s)]
*  There's a lot of things I could say here [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1895.48s)]
*  that I struggle with that maybe he suffered much longer [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1897.56s)]
*  than he needed to. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1903.52s)]
*  That's something I really think about a lot. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1904.84s)]
*  But I remember I had to take him to the hospital [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1907.84s)]
*  and the nurses couldn't carry him. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1912.92s)]
*  So you talk about 200 pound dog. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1918.08s)]
*  I was really into power lifting at the time. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1920.2s)]
*  I remember they tried to figure out [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1922.48s)]
*  all these kinds of ways to, [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1925.1200000000001s)]
*  so in order to put him to sleep, [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1927.52s)]
*  they had to take him into a room. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1929.3600000000001s)]
*  And so I had to carry him everywhere. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1933.0s)]
*  And here's this dying friend of mine [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1935.28s)]
*  that I just had to, [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1939.32s)]
*  first of all, it's really difficult to carry somebody [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1941.0s)]
*  that heavy when they're not helping you out. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1943.16s)]
*  And yeah, so I remember it was the first time [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1945.88s)]
*  seeing a friend laying there [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1951.64s)]
*  and seeing life drain from his body. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1954.16s)]
*  And that realization that we're here for a short time [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1960.2s)]
*  was made so real that here's a friend that was there for me [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1964.0800000000002s)]
*  the week before, the day before, and now he's gone. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1968.48s)]
*  And that was, I don't know, [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1971.96s)]
*  that spoke to the fact that he could be deeply connected [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1975.4s)]
*  with the dog. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1978.1200000000001s)]
*  Also spoke to the fact that the shared moments together [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1979.96s)]
*  that led to that deep friendship [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1986.56s)]
*  will make life so amazing. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1990.96s)]
*  But it also spoke to the fact that death is a motherfucker. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1994.28s)]
*  So I know you've lost Costello recently. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=1999.2s)]
*  Yeah, and as you're saying this, [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2001.6000000000001s)]
*  I'm definitely fighting back the tears. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2003.3600000000001s)]
*  And I thank you for sharing that. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2005.92s)]
*  That I guess we're about to both cry over our dead dogs. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2009.0800000000002s)]
*  That it was bound to happen [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2014.4s)]
*  just given when this is happening. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2016.04s)]
*  Yeah, it's- [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2019.24s)]
*  How long did you know that Costello was not doing well? [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2020.8000000000002s)]
*  Well, let's see, a year ago during the start of, [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2025.4s)]
*  about six months into the pandemic, [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2030.04s)]
*  he started getting abscesses and he was not, [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2032.16s)]
*  his behavior changed and something really changed. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2034.96s)]
*  And then I put him on testosterone [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2037.28s)]
*  because which helped a lot of things. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2041.52s)]
*  It certainly didn't cure everything, [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2043.84s)]
*  but it helped a lot of things. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2045.04s)]
*  He was dealing with joint pain, sleep issues. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2046.32s)]
*  And then it just became a very slow decline [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2049.6s)]
*  to the point where two, three weeks ago, [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2054.6s)]
*  he had a closet full of medication. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2057.08s)]
*  I mean, this dog was, it was like a pharmacy. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2061.04s)]
*  It's amazing to me when I looked at it the other day, [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2063.08s)]
*  I still haven't cleaned up and removed all his things [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2065.6s)]
*  because I can't quite bring myself to do it. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2067.7999999999997s)]
*  But- [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2069.56s)]
*  Do you think he was suffering? [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2071.6s)]
*  Well, so what happened was about a week ago, [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2073.2s)]
*  it was really just about a week ago, it's amazing. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2076.04s)]
*  He was going up the stairs and I saw him slip. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2078.24s)]
*  And he was a big dog, he wasn't 200 pounds, [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2080.7599999999998s)]
*  but he was about 90 pounds. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2082.52s)]
*  He was a bulldog, that's pretty big. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2083.48s)]
*  And he was fit. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2084.84s)]
*  And then I noticed that he wasn't carrying a foot [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2086.92s)]
*  in the back like it was injured. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2089.68s)]
*  It had no feeling at all. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2090.88s)]
*  He never liked me to touch his hind paws. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2092.12s)]
*  And I could do that thing was just flopping there. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2093.96s)]
*  And then the vet found some spinal degeneration [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2096.2s)]
*  and I was told that the next one would go, did he suffer? [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2099.56s)]
*  Sure hope not, but something changed in his eyes. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2103.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2107.16s)]
*  It's the eyes again, I know you and I spent long hours [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2108.0s)]
*  on the phone and talking about like the eyes [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2110.3199999999997s)]
*  and what they convey and what they mean [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2112.12s)]
*  about internal states and forsaker robots [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2113.72s)]
*  and biology of other kinds. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2116.6s)]
*  But do you think something about him was gone in his eyes? [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2117.88s)]
*  I think he was real, here I am anthropomorphizing. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2123.6400000000003s)]
*  I think he was realizing that one of his great joys in life [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2128.6s)]
*  which was to walk and sniff and pee on things. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2132.56s)]
*  This dog loved to pee on things, it was amazing. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2138.88s)]
*  I wondered where he put it. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2143.0s)]
*  He was like a reservoir of urine, it was incredible. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2144.64s)]
*  I think, oh, that's it, he's just, [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2148.04s)]
*  he put like one drop on the 50 millionth plant. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2149.24s)]
*  And then we get to the 50 millionth in one plant [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2152.2799999999997s)]
*  and he just have, you know, leave a puddle. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2154.8799999999997s)]
*  And here I am talking about Costello peeing. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2156.96s)]
*  He was losing that ability to stand up and do that. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2160.24s)]
*  He was falling down while he was doing that. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2162.7599999999998s)]
*  And I do think he started to realize [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2164.6s)]
*  and the passage was easy and peaceful, but you know, [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2167.2799999999997s)]
*  I'll say this, I'm not ashamed to say it. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2172.84s)]
*  I mean, I wake up every morning since then, [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2174.88s)]
*  just I don't even make the conscious decision [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2176.52s)]
*  to allow myself to cry, I wake up crying. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2178.96s)]
*  And I'm fortunately able to make it through the day [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2181.8s)]
*  thanks to the great support of my friends [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2183.88s)]
*  and you and my family, but I miss him, man. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2185.7000000000003s)]
*  You miss him? [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2189.84s)]
*  Yeah, I miss him. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2190.6800000000003s)]
*  And I feel like he, you know, Homer, Costello, [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2191.5s)]
*  you know, the relationship to one's dog is so specific. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2194.92s)]
*  But- [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2198.2400000000002s)]
*  So that party is gone. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2199.96s)]
*  That's the hard thing. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2203.68s)]
*  You know, what I think is different is that [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2205.2s)]
*  I made the mistake, I think. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2214.1s)]
*  I hope it was a good decision, [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2216.36s)]
*  but sometimes I think I made the mistake [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2217.54s)]
*  of I brought Costello a little bit to the world [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2219.0s)]
*  through the podcast, through posting about him. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2222.22s)]
*  I gave, I anthropomorphized about him in public. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2224.16s)]
*  Let's be honest, I have no idea [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2227.2799999999997s)]
*  what his mental life was or his relationship to me. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2228.36s)]
*  And I'm just exploring all this for the first time [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2230.56s)]
*  because he was my first dog, [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2232.52s)]
*  but I raised him since he was seven weeks. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2233.48s)]
*  Yeah, you gotta hold it together. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2235.4s)]
*  I noticed the episode you released on Monday, [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2236.7200000000003s)]
*  you mentioned Costello, like you brought him back to life [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2240.6800000000003s)]
*  for me for that brief moment. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2244.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, but he's gone. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2246.08s)]
*  Well, that's the, he's gonna be gone [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2247.8s)]
*  for a lot of people too. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2251.32s)]
*  Well, this is what I'm struggling with. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2254.2400000000002s)]
*  I know how to take care of myself pretty well. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2255.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2257.48s)]
*  I know I'm doing perfectly, but pretty well. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2259.32s)]
*  And I have good support. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2260.1600000000003s)]
*  I do worry a little bit about how it's gonna land [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2261.0s)]
*  and how people will feel. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2263.76s)]
*  I'm concerned about their internalization. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2265.2000000000003s)]
*  So that's something I'm still iterating on. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2269.04s)]
*  And you have to, they have to watch you struggle [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2271.28s)]
*  which is fascinating. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2273.36s)]
*  Right, and I've mostly been shielding them from this, [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2274.36s)]
*  but what would make me happiest [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2276.6000000000004s)]
*  is if people would internalize some of Costello's best traits [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2278.96s)]
*  and his best traits were that he was incredibly, [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2283.2000000000003s)]
*  tough. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2288.32s)]
*  I mean, he was a 22 inch neck bulldog, the whole thing. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2289.1600000000003s)]
*  He was just born that way. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2292.6400000000003s)]
*  But what was so beautiful is that his toughness [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2293.92s)]
*  is never what he rolled forward. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2297.28s)]
*  It was just how sweet and kind he was. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2299.0s)]
*  And so if people can take that, [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2302.06s)]
*  then there's a win in there someplace. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2304.1200000000003s)]
*  So I think there's some ways in which you should probably [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2307.34s)]
*  live on in your podcast too. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2310.7000000000003s)]
*  You should, I mean, it's such a, [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2312.76s)]
*  one of the things I loved about his role in your podcast [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2316.48s)]
*  is that he brought so much joy to you. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2320.8s)]
*  I mentioned the robots, right? [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2323.7599999999998s)]
*  I think that's such a powerful thing to bring that joy [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2326.92s)]
*  into like allowing yourself to experience that joy, [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2330.96s)]
*  to bring that joy to others, to share it with others. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2334.38s)]
*  That's really powerful. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2337.52s)]
*  And I mean, not to, this is like the Russian thing is, [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2338.8s)]
*  it touched me when Louis CK had that moment [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2343.36s)]
*  that I keep thinking about in his show, Louis, [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2349.04s)]
*  where like an old man was criticizing Louis [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2352.94s)]
*  for whining about breaking up with his girlfriend. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2355.24s)]
*  And he was saying like the most beautiful thing [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2357.8s)]
*  about love, the song that's catchy now, [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2363.4s)]
*  that's now making me feel horrible saying it, [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2367.48s)]
*  but like is the loss. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2370.66s)]
*  The loss really also is making you realize [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2372.7s)]
*  how much that person, that dog meant to you. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2376.22s)]
*  And like allowing yourself to feel that loss [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2381.3399999999997s)]
*  and not run away from that loss is really powerful. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2383.7s)]
*  And in some ways that's also sweet. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2386.42s)]
*  Just like the love was, the loss is also sweet [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2390.06s)]
*  because you know that you felt a lot for that, [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2393.06s)]
*  for your friend. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2397.48s)]
*  So I, you know, and I continue bringing that joy. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2398.76s)]
*  I think it would be amazing to the podcast. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2402.1200000000003s)]
*  I hope to do the same with robots [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2405.28s)]
*  or whatever else is the source of joy, right? [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2408.6800000000003s)]
*  And maybe do you think about one day getting another dog? [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2412.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, in time, you're hitting on all the key buttons here. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2417.44s)]
*  I want that to, we're thinking about, you know, [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2423.5600000000004s)]
*  ways to kind of immortalize Costello in a way that's real, [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2427.7s)]
*  not just, you know, creating some little logo [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2430.58s)]
*  or something silly. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2433.72s)]
*  You know, Costello, much like David Goggins is a person, [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2434.7s)]
*  but Goggins also has grown into kind of a verb. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2438.7999999999997s)]
*  You're gonna Goggins this, and there's an adjective. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2442.1s)]
*  Like that's extremely like it. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2445.06s)]
*  I think that for me, Costello was all those things. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2447.3399999999997s)]
*  He was a being, he was his own being. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2449.3799999999997s)]
*  He was a noun, a verb and an adjective. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2451.7799999999997s)]
*  So, and he had this amazing superpower [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2455.2999999999997s)]
*  that I wish I could get, which was this ability [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2457.38s)]
*  to get everyone else to do things for you [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2459.1800000000003s)]
*  without doing a damn thing. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2460.98s)]
*  The Costello effect, as I call it. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2462.7400000000002s)]
*  So, it's an idea I hope he lives on. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2465.26s)]
*  There's a saying that I heard when I was a graduate student [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2468.06s)]
*  that's just been ringing in my mind [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2470.26s)]
*  throughout this conversation in such a, [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2472.84s)]
*  I think appropriate way, which is that, [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2475.38s)]
*  Lex, you are in a minority of one. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2478.9s)]
*  You are truly extraordinary in your ability [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2481.62s)]
*  to encapsulate so many aspects of science, engineering, [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2485.46s)]
*  public communication about so many topics, martial arts, [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2490.5s)]
*  and the emotional depth that you bring to it, [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2495.6s)]
*  and just the purposefulness. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2497.42s)]
*  And I think if it's not clear to people, [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2499.36s)]
*  it absolutely should be stated, [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2501.94s)]
*  but I think it's abundantly clear that just the amount [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2504.2s)]
*  of time and thinking that you put into things is, [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2507.42s)]
*  it is the ultimate mark of respect. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2511.7s)]
*  So, I'm just extraordinarily grateful for your friendship [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2515.1400000000003s)]
*  and for this conversation. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2518.34s)]
*  I'm proud to be your friend, [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2519.46s)]
*  and I just wish you showed me the same kind of respect [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2521.46s)]
*  by wearing a suit and make your father proud, [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2523.7400000000002s)]
*  maybe next time. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2526.1400000000003s)]
*  Next time, indeed. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2527.82s)]
*  Thanks so much, my friend. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2529.38s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2530.78s)]
*  Thank you, Andrew. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCzecagKBjY&t=2531.6200000000003s)]
