Video Description: In this Huberman Lab Essentials episode, I explore the sensations of pain and pleasure, explaining how they are sensed in the body and interpreted by the brain as well as methods to control their intensity.
I discuss both the hardwired mechanisms and subjective factors that shape an individualâ€™s perception of pain and pleasure. I also explain why pain thresholds vary from person to person and discuss various treatments for pain management such as acupuncture and supplements. Finally, I explain the role of key neurochemicals like dopamine and serotonin in mediating our experience of pain and pleasure.

# How to Control Your Sense of Pain & Pleasure | Huberman Lab Essentials
**Andrew Huberman:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g)
*  Welcome to Huberman Lab Essentials, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=0.0s)]
*  where we revisit past episodes [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=2.44s)]
*  for the most potent and actionable science-based tools [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=4.48s)]
*  for mental health, physical health, and performance. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=7.66s)]
*  I'm Andrew Huberman, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=11.96s)]
*  and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  at Stanford School of Medicine. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=15.56s)]
*  Today, we continue our discussion of the senses, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=17.7s)]
*  and the senses we are going to discuss [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=21.16s)]
*  are pain and pleasure. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=23.36s)]
*  Pain and pleasure reflect two opposite ends of a continuum, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=26.0s)]
*  a continuum that involves detection of things in our skin [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=29.86s)]
*  and the perception, the understanding [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=34.7s)]
*  of what those events are. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=37.24s)]
*  Our skin is our largest sensory organ [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=39.78s)]
*  and our largest organ indeed. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=42.96s)]
*  It is much larger than any of the other organs in our body, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=45.1s)]
*  and it's an odd organ if you think about it. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=48.66s)]
*  It has so many functions. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=50.82s)]
*  It acts as a barrier between our organs [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=52.66s)]
*  and the outside world. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=54.9s)]
*  It harbors neurons, nerve cells, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=56.7s)]
*  that allow us to detect things like light touch [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=59.1s)]
*  or temperature or pressure of various kinds. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=62.7s)]
*  And it's an organ that we hang ornaments on. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=66.34s)]
*  People put earrings in their ears. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=69.34s)]
*  People decorate their skin with tattoos [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=71.7s)]
*  and inks and other things. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=75.02s)]
*  And it's an organ that allows us to experience [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=77.22s)]
*  either great pain or great pleasure. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=80.38s)]
*  So it's a multifaceted organ, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=84.22s)]
*  and it's one that our brain needs to make sense of [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=86.3s)]
*  in a multifaceted way. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=89.06s)]
*  I think we all intuitively understand [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=90.9s)]
*  what pleasure and pain are. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=92.78s)]
*  Pleasure generally is a sensation in the body [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=94.94s)]
*  and in the mind that leads us to pursue more [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=97.62s)]
*  of whatever is bringing about that sensation. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=101.66s)]
*  And pain is also a sensation in the body and in the mind [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=104.9s)]
*  that in general leads us to want to withdraw [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=110.34s)]
*  or move away from some activity or interaction. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=113.58s)]
*  Scientists would call this appetitive behaviors, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=117.02s)]
*  meaning behaviors that lead us to create an appetite [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=120.22s)]
*  for more of those behaviors and aversive behaviors, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=123.66s)]
*  behaviors that make us want to move away from something. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=127.5s)]
*  The organ that we call the skin, as I mentioned earlier, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=130.46s)]
*  is the largest organ in our body. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=132.85999999999999s)]
*  And throughout that organ, we have neurons, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=135.14s)]
*  little nerve cells. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=138.42s)]
*  Now to be really technical about it, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=139.5s)]
*  and the way I'd like you to understand it [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=141.26s)]
*  is that the so-called cell body, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=143.26s)]
*  meaning the location of a cell in which the DNA [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=145.46s)]
*  and other goodies, the kind of central factory of the cell, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=148.54000000000002s)]
*  that actually sits right outside your spinal cord. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=151.74s)]
*  So all up and down your spinal cord on either side [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=154.58s)]
*  are these little blobs of neurons, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=158.38s)]
*  little collections of neurons. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=160.70000000000002s)]
*  They're called DRGs, dorsal root ganglia. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=162.06s)]
*  A ganglion is just a collection or clump of cells. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=165.94s)]
*  And those DRGs are really interesting [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=169.9s)]
*  because they send one branch that we call an axon, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=172.34s)]
*  a little wire out to our skin. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=176.12s)]
*  And they have another wire from that same cell body [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=178.78s)]
*  that goes in the opposite direction, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=181.74s)]
*  which is up to our brain and creates connections [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=183.02s)]
*  within our brain and the so-called brainstem. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=187.1s)]
*  Okay, these wires are positioned within the skin [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=189.66s)]
*  to respond to mechanical forces. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=192.92000000000002s)]
*  So maybe light touch. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=195.52s)]
*  Some will only send electrical activity up toward the brain [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=197.02s)]
*  in response to light touch. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=202.14000000000001s)]
*  Others respond to coarse pressure, to hard pressure, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=204.86s)]
*  but they won't respond to a light feather. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=208.34s)]
*  Others respond to temperature. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=211.12s)]
*  So they will respond to the presence of heat [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=213.18s)]
*  or the presence of cold. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=216.10000000000002s)]
*  And still others respond to other types of stimuli [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=217.94s)]
*  like certain chemicals on our skin. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=221.10000000000002s)]
*  So these neurons are amazing. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=223.78s)]
*  They're collecting information of particular kinds [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=225.10000000000002s)]
*  from the skin throughout the entire body [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=228.10000000000002s)]
*  and sending that information up toward the brain. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=230.66s)]
*  And what's really incredible, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=233.9s)]
*  I just want you to ponder this for a second. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=235.76s)]
*  What's really incredible is that the language [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=237.82s)]
*  that those neurons use is exactly the same. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=239.7s)]
*  The neuron that responds to light touch [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=242.62s)]
*  sends electrical signals up toward the brain. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=245.1s)]
*  The neurons that respond to cold or to heat [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=247.56s)]
*  or to habanero pepper, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=251.01999999999998s)]
*  they only respond to the particular thing [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=253.3s)]
*  that evokes the electrical response. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=256.88s)]
*  I should say that they only respond [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=260.64s)]
*  to the particular stimulus, the pepper, the cold, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=262.7s)]
*  the heat, et cetera, that will evoke an electrical signal. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=265.52s)]
*  But the electrical signals are a common language [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=269.24s)]
*  that all neurons use. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=271.84s)]
*  And yet if something cold is presented to your skin [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=273.14s)]
*  like an ice cube, you know that that sensation, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=276.88s)]
*  that thing is cold. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=280.42s)]
*  You don't misperceive it as heat or as a habanero pepper. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=281.68s)]
*  So that's amazing. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=286.16s)]
*  What that means is that there must be another element [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=287.1s)]
*  in the equation of what creates pleasure or pain. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=290.40000000000003s)]
*  And that element is your brain. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=293.64s)]
*  Your brain takes these electrical signals [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=296.44s)]
*  and interprets them partially based on experience, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=298.2s)]
*  but also there are some innate, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=301.5s)]
*  meaning some hardwired aspects of pain and pleasure sensing [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=303.40000000000003s)]
*  that require no experience whatsoever. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=307.32s)]
*  A child doesn't have to touch a flame but once, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=309.64s)]
*  and the very first time they will withdraw their hand [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=312.2s)]
*  from the flame. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=314.4s)]
*  The pain and pleasure system don't need prior experience. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=315.47999999999996s)]
*  What they need is a brain that can interpret [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=319.02s)]
*  these electrical signals and somehow create [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=321.09999999999997s)]
*  what we call pleasure and pain out of them. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=324.06s)]
*  So what parts of the brain? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=327.08s)]
*  Well, mainly it's the so-called somatosensory cortex, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=328.7s)]
*  the portion of our neocortex, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=332.28s)]
*  which is on the outside of our brain, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=334.67999999999995s)]
*  the kind of bumpy part. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=336.03999999999996s)]
*  And in your somatosensory cortex, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=337.65999999999997s)]
*  you have a map of your entire body surface. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=339.96s)]
*  That map is called a homunculus. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=342.36s)]
*  It's your representation of touch, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=345.08000000000004s)]
*  including pleasure and pain. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=346.96000000000004s)]
*  But it's not randomly organized. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=348.84000000000003s)]
*  It's highly organized in a very particular way, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=350.88s)]
*  which is that the areas of your skin [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=354.44s)]
*  that have the highest density of these sensory receptors [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=356.92s)]
*  are magnified in your brain. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=361.32s)]
*  What are the areas that are magnified? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=363.88s)]
*  Well, the lips, the face, the tips of the fingers, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=365.88s)]
*  the feet and the genitals. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=370.12s)]
*  And that's because the innervation, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=372.6s)]
*  the number of wires that go into those regions of your body [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=375.2s)]
*  far exceeds the number of wires for sensation of touch [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=379.52s)]
*  that go to other areas of your body. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=383.64s)]
*  You can actually experience this in real time right now [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=386.74s)]
*  by doing a simple experiment [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=390.82s)]
*  that we call two-point discrimination. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=392.16s)]
*  Two-point discrimination is your ability [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=394.76s)]
*  to know whether or not two points of pressure [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=397.34s)]
*  are far apart near each other, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=400.73999999999995s)]
*  or you actually could perceive incorrectly [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=404.21999999999997s)]
*  as one point of pressure. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=407.58s)]
*  You might want a second person to do this experiment. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=409.65999999999997s)]
*  That person would take two fine points. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=412.82s)]
*  So it could be two pencils or pens or the backs of pens. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=415.29999999999995s)]
*  If you were to close your eyes [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=417.97999999999996s)]
*  and I were to take these two pens [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=420.03999999999996s)]
*  and put their points close together, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=422.41999999999996s)]
*  about a centimeter apart, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=423.97999999999996s)]
*  and present them to the top of your hand, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=425.6s)]
*  you, even though your eyes were closed, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=427.6s)]
*  you would be able to perceive [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=429.40000000000003s)]
*  that that was two points of pressure [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=430.46000000000004s)]
*  presented simultaneously to the top of your hand. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=432.56s)]
*  However, if I were to do this to the middle of your back, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=435.48s)]
*  you would not experience them as two points of pressure. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=439.12s)]
*  You would experience them as one single point of pressure. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=441.88s)]
*  In other words, your two-point discrimination is better, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=445.28000000000003s)]
*  is higher on areas of your body, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=448.12s)]
*  which have many, many more sensory receptors. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=451.1s)]
*  Most of us don't really appreciate how important [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=453.84s)]
*  and what a profound influence this change [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=457.03999999999996s)]
*  in density of receptors across our body surface has. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=459.44s)]
*  You've got sensors in the skin, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=462.84s)]
*  and you've got a brain that's going to interpret [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=465.47999999999996s)]
*  what's going on with those sensors. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=467.62s)]
*  And believe it or not, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=469.4s)]
*  your subjective interpretation of what's happening [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=471.03999999999996s)]
*  has a profound influence [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=473.64s)]
*  on your experience of pleasure or pain. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=476.29999999999995s)]
*  There are several things that can impact these experiences, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=479.64s)]
*  but the main categories are expectation. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=482.76s)]
*  If someone tells you, this is going to hurt, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=486.52s)]
*  I'm going to give you an injection right here, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=488.42s)]
*  it might hurt for a second. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=490.15999999999997s)]
*  That's very different, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=491.46s)]
*  and your experience of that pain will be very different [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=492.36s)]
*  than if it happened suddenly out of the blue. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=494.28s)]
*  There's also anxiety, how anxious, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=496.84s)]
*  or how high or low your level of arousal, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=498.76s)]
*  autonomic arousal, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=501.48s)]
*  that's going to impact your experience of pleasure or pain. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=503.15999999999997s)]
*  How well you slept, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=507.48s)]
*  and where you are in the so-called circadian [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=509.4s)]
*  or 24 hour cycle. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=511.88s)]
*  Our ability to tolerate pain changes dramatically [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=514.3199999999999s)]
*  across the 24 hour cycle. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=518.28s)]
*  And as you can imagine, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=520.0799999999999s)]
*  it's during the daylight waking hours [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=521.28s)]
*  that we are better able to tolerate. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=523.34s)]
*  We are more resilient to pain, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=525.64s)]
*  and we are better able to experience pleasure. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=527.92s)]
*  At night, our threshold for pain is much lower. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=531.88s)]
*  In other words, the amount of mechanical [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=535.84s)]
*  or chemical or thermal, meaning temperature stimulated, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=539.08s)]
*  that can evoke a pain response, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=541.84s)]
*  and how we would rate that response is much lower at night. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=543.32s)]
*  And in particular, in the hours between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m., [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=549.0s)]
*  if you're on a kind of standard circadian schedule. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=553.26s)]
*  And then the last one is our genes. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=555.96s)]
*  Pain threshold and how long a pain response lasts [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=558.72s)]
*  is in part dictated by our genes. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=563.08s)]
*  So we have expectation, anxiety, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=565.72s)]
*  how well we've slept, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=567.9s)]
*  where we are in the so-called 24 hour circadian time, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=569.06s)]
*  and our genes. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=572.9s)]
*  So let's talk about expectation and anxiety, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=575.38s)]
*  because those two factors can powerfully modulate [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=578.26s)]
*  our experience of both pleasure and pain [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=581.54s)]
*  in ways that will allow us to dial up pleasure, if we like, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=583.8199999999999s)]
*  and to dial down pain, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=589.18s)]
*  if indeed that's what we want to do. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=591.14s)]
*  So let's talk about expectation and anxiety, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=592.86s)]
*  because those two things are somewhat tethered. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=595.36s)]
*  There are now a number of solid experiments [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=598.5600000000001s)]
*  that point to the fact that [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=601.0s)]
*  if we know a painful stimulus is coming, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=602.82s)]
*  that we can better prepare for it mentally, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=605.98s)]
*  and therefore buffer or reduce the pain response. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=608.92s)]
*  But essentially, if subjects are warned [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=612.4s)]
*  that a painful stimulus is coming, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=615.04s)]
*  their subjective experience of that pain is vastly reduced. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=617.36s)]
*  However, if they are warned just two seconds [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=623.26s)]
*  before that pain arrives, it does not help. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=626.78s)]
*  It actually makes it worse. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=630.04s)]
*  And the reason is they can't do anything mentally [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=631.6800000000001s)]
*  to prepare for it in that brief two second window. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=633.84s)]
*  Similarly, if they are warned about pain that's coming [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=637.8000000000001s)]
*  two minutes before a painful stimulus is coming, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=641.44s)]
*  that also makes it worse, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=644.24s)]
*  because their expectation ramps up the autonomic arousal, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=645.54s)]
*  the level of alertness is all funneled [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=649.68s)]
*  toward that negative experience that's coming. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=652.62s)]
*  So how soon before a painful stimulus [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=656.28s)]
*  should we know about it [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=660.28s)]
*  if the goal is to reduce our level of pain? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=661.92s)]
*  And the answer is somewhere between 20 seconds [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=665.4799999999999s)]
*  and 40 seconds is about right. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=669.3s)]
*  This can come in useful in a variety of contexts, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=671.76s)]
*  but I think it's important because what it illustrates [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=674.5s)]
*  is that it absolutely cannot be just the pattern [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=678.42s)]
*  of signals that are arriving from the skin. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=681.9799999999999s)]
*  There has to be a subjective interpretation component [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=684.88s)]
*  because we are all different in terms of our pain threshold. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=688.42s)]
*  First of all, what is pain threshold? [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=691.4799999999999s)]
*  Pain threshold has two dimensions. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=693.5999999999999s)]
*  The first dimension is the amount of mechanical or chemical [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=695.78s)]
*  or thermal stimulation that it takes for you or me [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=700.8199999999999s)]
*  or somebody else to say, I can't take that anymore, I'm done. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=704.2199999999999s)]
*  But there's another element as well, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=708.0s)]
*  which is how long the pain persists. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=709.56s)]
*  And to just really point out how varied we all are [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=712.18s)]
*  in terms of our experience of pain, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=715.22s)]
*  let's look to an experiment. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=717.18s)]
*  There have been experiments done [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=719.38s)]
*  at Stanford School of Medicine and elsewhere, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=720.8s)]
*  which involved having subjects put their hand [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=723.68s)]
*  into a very cold vat of water [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=725.98s)]
*  and measuring the amount of time [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=728.36s)]
*  that they kept their hand in that water. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=729.92s)]
*  And then they would tell the experimenter [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=731.8s)]
*  how painful that particular stimulus was [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=734.08s)]
*  on a scale of one to 10. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=737.1s)]
*  That simple experiment revealed [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=738.78s)]
*  that people experienced the same thermal, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=740.78s)]
*  in this case, cold stimulus, vastly different. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=744.02s)]
*  Some people would rate it as a 10 out of 10, extreme pain. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=748.0400000000001s)]
*  Other people would rate it as barely painful at all, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=751.84s)]
*  like a one, other people a three, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=754.6s)]
*  other people a five, et cetera. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=756.58s)]
*  In fact, there is no objective measure of pain. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=758.6800000000001s)]
*  Similarly, pleasure is something that we all talk about, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=763.5s)]
*  but we have no way of gauging [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=766.82s)]
*  what other people are experiencing [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=769.1600000000001s)]
*  except what they report through language. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=770.62s)]
*  So rather than focus on just the subjective nature of pain, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=773.74s)]
*  let's talk about the absolute qualities of pain [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=777.0200000000001s)]
*  and the absolute qualities of pleasure [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=780.46s)]
*  so that we can learn how to navigate those two experiences [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=783.2800000000001s)]
*  in ways that serve us each better. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=786.82s)]
*  First of all, I want to talk about heat and cold. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=790.1s)]
*  We do indeed have sensors in our skin [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=792.96s)]
*  that respond to heat and cold. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=794.7s)]
*  And one of the best tests of how somebody can handle pain [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=796.58s)]
*  is to ask them to just get into an ice bath. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=800.98s)]
*  Some do it quickly, some do it slowly. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=804.1s)]
*  Others find the experience of cold to be so aversive [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=806.6800000000001s)]
*  that they somehow cannot get themselves in. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=810.26s)]
*  I think it can be helpful to everyone to know [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=812.58s)]
*  that even though it feels better at a mental level [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=815.0600000000001s)]
*  to get into the cold slowly, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=818.46s)]
*  it is actually much worse from a neurobiological perspective. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=820.62s)]
*  The neurons that sense cold respond [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=824.3s)]
*  to what are called relative drops in temperature. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=826.8599999999999s)]
*  So it's not about the absolute temperature of the water, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=830.26s)]
*  it's about the relative change in temperature. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=833.78s)]
*  Therefore you can bypass these signals going up to the brain [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=837.54s)]
*  with each relative change, one degree change, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=842.3399999999999s)]
*  two degrees change, et cetera, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=844.9s)]
*  by simply getting in all at once. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=847.0999999999999s)]
*  In fact, it is true that if you get into cold water [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=849.62s)]
*  up to your neck, it's actually much more comfortable [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=852.26s)]
*  than if you're halfway in and halfway out. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=855.1s)]
*  And that's because of the difference in the signals [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=857.14s)]
*  that are being sent from the cold receptors [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=859.54s)]
*  on your upper torso, which is out of the water [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=861.7s)]
*  in your lower torso. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=863.5s)]
*  Now, I wouldn't want anyone to take this to mean [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=864.74s)]
*  that they should just jump into an unknown body of water. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=867.36s)]
*  People can have heart attacks [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=869.58s)]
*  from getting into extremely cold water. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=870.78s)]
*  But it is absolutely true that provided it's safe, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=873.1s)]
*  getting into a cold water is always going to be easier [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=875.62s)]
*  to do quickly and it's going to be easier [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=878.68s)]
*  to do up to your neck. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=880.86s)]
*  Now, heat is the opposite. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=882.6s)]
*  Heat is measured in absolute terms by the neurons. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=884.48s)]
*  So gradually moving into heat makes sense [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=888.46s)]
*  and finding that threshold, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=891.6800000000001s)]
*  which is safe and comfortable for you, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=892.9s)]
*  or if it's uncomfortable, at least resides [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=895.0600000000001s)]
*  within that realm of safety. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=897.36s)]
*  One of the most important things to understand [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=900.3000000000001s)]
*  about the experience of pain and to really illustrate [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=902.58s)]
*  just how subjective pain really is, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=905.38s)]
*  is that our experience of pain [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=908.58s)]
*  and the degree of damage to our body [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=911.14s)]
*  are not always correlated. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=913.46s)]
*  A classic example of this was published [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=914.94s)]
*  in the British Journal of Medicine [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=917.0200000000001s)]
*  in which a construction worker fell from, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=919.0200000000001s)]
*  I think it was a second story, which he was working. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=922.26s)]
*  And a nail went up and through his boot. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=925.62s)]
*  And he looked down and he saw the nail going [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=930.1800000000001s)]
*  through his boot and he was in absolute excruciating pain. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=933.5s)]
*  They took him to the hospital [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=939.1800000000001s)]
*  and because the nail was so long [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=941.0600000000001s)]
*  and because of where it had entered and exited the boot, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=943.0600000000001s)]
*  they had to cut away the boot in order to get to the nail. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=945.84s)]
*  And when they did that, they revealed [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=950.34s)]
*  that the nail had passed between two of his toes. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=952.0200000000001s)]
*  It had actually failed to impale his body in any way. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=955.0200000000001s)]
*  And yet the view, the perception of that nail [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=960.1s)]
*  entering his boot at one end [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=963.08s)]
*  and exiting the boot at the other [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=965.1s)]
*  was sufficient to create the experience [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=966.66s)]
*  of a nail that had gone through his foot. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=969.5799999999999s)]
*  And the moment he realized [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=972.5s)]
*  that that nail had not gone through his foot, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=974.2199999999999s)]
*  the pain completely evaporated. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=976.9399999999999s)]
*  And I want to make sure that I emphasize [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=978.98s)]
*  the so-called psychosomatic phenomenon. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=982.3s)]
*  I think sometimes we hear psychosomatic [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=985.02s)]
*  and we interpret that as meaning all in one's head. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=987.18s)]
*  But I think it's important to remember [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=990.2199999999999s)]
*  that everything is neural, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=992.02s)]
*  whether or not it's pain in your body [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=993.18s)]
*  because you have a gaping wound [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=995.0s)]
*  and you're hemorrhaging out of that wound [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=997.28s)]
*  or whether or not it's pain for which you cannot explain it [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=999.24s)]
*  on the basis of any kind of injury, it's all neural. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1003.76s)]
*  So saying body, brain or psychosomatic, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1006.28s)]
*  it's kind of irrelevant. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1009.56s)]
*  And I hope someday we move past that language. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1010.96s)]
*  So when we hear syndrome [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1013.44s)]
*  and a patient comes into a clinic [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1015.8s)]
*  and says that they suffer for instance [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1018.12s)]
*  from something which is very controversial, frankly, [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1020.36s)]
*  like chronic fatigue syndrome, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1022.84s)]
*  some physicians believe that it reflects [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1024.4s)]
*  a real underlying medical condition, others don't. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1026.72s)]
*  However, syndrome means we don't understand. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1030.5400000000002s)]
*  And that doesn't mean something doesn't exist. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1034.88s)]
*  Fibromyalgia or whole body pain for a long time [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1037.96s)]
*  was written off or kind of explained away [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1042.0s)]
*  by physicians and scientists, frankly, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1045.3000000000002s)]
*  my community as one of these syndromes. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1047.64s)]
*  It couldn't be explained. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1051.0400000000002s)]
*  However, now there is firm understanding [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1052.18s)]
*  of at least one of the bases for this whole body pain. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1055.24s)]
*  And that's activation of a particular cell type called glia. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1058.8600000000001s)]
*  And there's a receptor on these glia [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1063.9s)]
*  for those of you that want to know [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1065.8200000000002s)]
*  called the Toll-4 receptor. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1066.76s)]
*  And activation of the Toll-4 receptor [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1069.1200000000001s)]
*  is related to certain forms of whole body pain [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1072.28s)]
*  and fibromyalgia. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1075.1000000000001s)]
*  Now, what treatments exist for fibromyalgia? [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1077.0s)]
*  There are clinical data using a prescription drug. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1081.18s)]
*  The drug is called naltrexone. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1085.66s)]
*  Naltrexone is actually used for the treatment [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1087.1000000000001s)]
*  of various opioid addictions and things of that sort. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1089.26s)]
*  But it turns out that a very low dose [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1093.5s)]
*  has been shown to have some success [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1096.0800000000002s)]
*  in dealing with and treating certain forms of fibromyalgia. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1098.5s)]
*  And it has that success because of its ability [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1101.3s)]
*  to bind to and block these Toll-4 receptors on glia. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1104.14s)]
*  There's another approach that one could take [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1108.58s)]
*  and that compound is acetyl-L-carnitine. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1110.58s)]
*  There is evidence that acetyl-L-carnitine [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1114.46s)]
*  can reduce the symptoms of chronic whole body pain [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1117.44s)]
*  and other certain forms of acute pain [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1120.1399999999999s)]
*  at dosages of somewhere between one to three [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1123.22s)]
*  and sometimes four grams per day. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1126.36s)]
*  Now, acetyl-L-carnitine can be taken orally. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1128.7s)]
*  It's found in 500 milligram capsules [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1131.26s)]
*  as well as by injection. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1133.98s)]
*  There are a large number of studies on acetyl-L-carnitine. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1136.44s)]
*  You can look those up on PubMed if you like [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1138.88s)]
*  or on examine.com. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1141.3400000000001s)]
*  So it appears that L-carnitine is impacting [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1143.2s)]
*  a number of different processes both to impact pain [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1145.66s)]
*  and perhaps, and I want to underscore perhaps, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1148.52s)]
*  but there are good studies happening now, [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1150.64s)]
*  perhaps accelerate wound healing as well. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1153.6000000000001s)]
*  Now I'd like to turn our attention [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1157.04s)]
*  to a completely non-drug, non-supplement related approach [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1158.44s)]
*  to dealing with pain. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1163.18s)]
*  And it's one that has existed for thousands of years [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1164.72s)]
*  and that only recently has the Western scientific community [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1168.56s)]
*  started to pay serious attention to. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1172.8s)]
*  And there is terrific mechanistic science [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1175.32s)]
*  to now explain how and why acupuncture can work very well [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1178.48s)]
*  for the treatment of certain forms of pain. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1184.08s)]
*  Now, first off, I want to tell you what was told to me [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1186.56s)]
*  by our director or chief of the Pain Division [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1190.06s)]
*  at Stanford School of Medicine, Dr. Sean Mackey, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1192.96s)]
*  which was that a fraction of people [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1195.48s)]
*  experience tremendous pain relief from acupuncture [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1198.2s)]
*  and others experience none at all or very little. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1201.32s)]
*  A number of laboratories have started to explore [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1204.28s)]
*  how acupuncture works. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1207.24s)]
*  And one of the premier laboratories for this [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1209.44s)]
*  is Chufu Ma's lab at Harvard Medical School. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1211.96s)]
*  Now the form of acupuncture that they explored [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1215.8600000000001s)]
*  was one that's commonly in use called electroacupuncture. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1217.82s)]
*  So this isn't just putting little needles [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1220.44s)]
*  into different parts of the body. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1222.84s)]
*  These needles are able to pass an electrical current, [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1224.72s)]
*  not magically, but because they have a little wire [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1228.48s)]
*  going back to a device and you can pass electrical current. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1230.24s)]
*  So what Chufu Ma's lab found was that [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1232.4399999999998s)]
*  if electroacupuncture is provided to the abdomen, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1234.6999999999998s)]
*  to the stomach area, it creates activation [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1239.04s)]
*  of what are called the sympathetic ganglia. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1243.6399999999999s)]
*  And the activation of these neurons involves noradrenaline [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1245.3999999999999s)]
*  and something called NPY, neuropeptide Y. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1250.12s)]
*  The long and short of it is that stimulating the abdomen [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1254.6799999999998s)]
*  with electroacupuncture was either anti-inflammatory [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1257.32s)]
*  or could cause inflammation. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1262.4399999999998s)]
*  It could actually exacerbate inflammation, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1264.36s)]
*  depending on whether or not it was of low or high intensity. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1266.3999999999999s)]
*  Now that makes it a very precarious technique. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1270.52s)]
*  And this may speak to some of the reason [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1272.7199999999998s)]
*  why some people report relief from acupuncture [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1275.04s)]
*  and others do not. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1278.0s)]
*  However, they went a step further [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1279.48s)]
*  and stimulated other areas of the body [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1281.3600000000001s)]
*  using electroacupuncture. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1283.76s)]
*  And what they found is that stimulation of the legs [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1284.96s)]
*  caused a circuit, a neural circuit to be activated [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1287.76s)]
*  that goes from the legs up to an area [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1290.54s)]
*  of the base of the brain called the DMV [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1294.0s)]
*  and activated the adrenal glands, [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1297.44s)]
*  which sit atop your kidneys [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1299.34s)]
*  and caused the release of what are called catecholamines. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1301.4s)]
*  And those were strongly anti-inflammatory. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1305.32s)]
*  In other words, electroacupuncture of the legs and feet [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1308.84s)]
*  can, if done correctly, be anti-inflammatory [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1313.4399999999998s)]
*  and reduce symptoms of pain [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1316.6s)]
*  and perhaps accelerate wound healing [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1318.76s)]
*  because activations of these catecholaminergic pathways [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1321.34s)]
*  can accelerate wound healing as well. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1324.84s)]
*  Now let's talk about a phenomenon that has long intrigued [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1327.12s)]
*  and perplexed people for probably thousands of years, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1330.62s)]
*  and that's redheads. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1334.56s)]
*  You may have heard before that redheads [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1336.72s)]
*  have a higher pain threshold than other individuals. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1338.44s)]
*  And indeed that is true. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1341.56s)]
*  There's now a study that looked at this mechanistically. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1344.28s)]
*  There's a gene called the MC1R gene. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1347.6000000000001s)]
*  And this MC1R gene encodes [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1352.1200000000001s)]
*  for a number of different proteins. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1354.52s)]
*  Some of those proteins, of course, [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1356.98s)]
*  are related to the production of melanin. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1358.6000000000001s)]
*  This is why redheads often, not always, [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1360.88s)]
*  but often are very fair skinned, [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1363.2s)]
*  sometimes have freckles, not always, [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1365.28s)]
*  and of course have red hair. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1367.36s)]
*  This gene, this MC1R gene is associated with a pathway [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1369.0s)]
*  that relates to something that I've talked about [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1373.9199999999998s)]
*  on this podcast before during the episode [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1376.6s)]
*  on hunger and feeding. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1379.12s)]
*  And this is POMC. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1380.6399999999999s)]
*  POMC stands for pro-opio melanocortin. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1383.24s)]
*  And POMC is cut up, it's cleaved into different hormones, [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1387.4799999999998s)]
*  including one that enhances pain perception. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1392.3999999999999s)]
*  This is melanocyte stimulating hormone. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1395.68s)]
*  And another one that blocks pain, beta endorphin. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1398.3200000000002s)]
*  The endorphins are endogenously made, [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1401.96s)]
*  meaning made within our body, opioids. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1404.6000000000001s)]
*  They actually make us feel numb [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1407.5s)]
*  in response to certain kinds of pain. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1410.88s)]
*  Now, not completely numb, [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1412.42s)]
*  but they numb or reduce our perception of pain. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1413.78s)]
*  We all have beta endorphins, we all have POMC, et cetera, [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1417.74s)]
*  but redheads make more of these endogenous endorphins. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1421.6200000000001s)]
*  Now, this of course should not be taken to mean [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1425.64s)]
*  that redheads can tolerate more pain [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1428.0s)]
*  and therefore should be subjected to more pain. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1430.5200000000002s)]
*  All it means is that their threshold for pain on average, [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1432.8000000000002s)]
*  not all of them, but on average, [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1436.66s)]
*  is shifted higher than that of other individuals. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1438.6000000000001s)]
*  And I should mention, because I mentioned the ice bath, [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1441.8400000000001s)]
*  that of course pain threshold [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1444.2800000000002s)]
*  is something that can be built up, [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1446.5600000000002s)]
*  but it does seem that certain patterns of thinking [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1448.3600000000001s)]
*  can allow us to buffer ourselves against the pain response. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1451.0s)]
*  And that should not be surprising. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1454.64s)]
*  Certain forms of thinking are associated [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1457.16s)]
*  with the release of particular neuromodulators, [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1459.1200000000001s)]
*  in particular dopamine. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1461.44s)]
*  And dopamine, it may seem is kind of the thing [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1463.1200000000001s)]
*  that underlies everything, but it's not. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1466.88s)]
*  Dopamine is a molecule that's associated [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1468.8000000000002s)]
*  with novelty, expectation, motivation, and reward. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1471.42s)]
*  We talked about this at the beginning of the episode. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1474.3600000000001s)]
*  And the ways in which dopamine can modulate pain [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1476.5800000000002s)]
*  is not mysterious. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1479.4s)]
*  It's really through the activation of brainstem neurons [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1480.8200000000002s)]
*  that communicate with areas of our body [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1484.12s)]
*  that deploy things like immune cells. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1486.9599999999998s)]
*  So for instance, we have neurons in our brainstem [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1489.6799999999998s)]
*  that can be modulated by the release of dopamine. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1492.9599999999998s)]
*  And those neurons in the brainstem [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1496.56s)]
*  control the release of immune cells [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1498.4399999999998s)]
*  from tissues like the spleen or organs like the spleen. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1500.7199999999998s)]
*  And those immune cells can then go combat infection. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1504.08s)]
*  We've heard before that when we're happy, [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1506.9799999999998s)]
*  we're better able to combat infection, [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1508.6399999999999s)]
*  deal with pain, deal with all sorts of things. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1511.0s)]
*  It essentially makes us more resilient [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1513.28s)]
*  because dopamine affects particular circuits [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1515.3999999999999s)]
*  and tells in a very neurobiological way, [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1518.0s)]
*  in a biochemical way, tells those cells and circuits [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1521.08s)]
*  that conditions are good. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1524.32s)]
*  And it really does allow for more resilience. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1525.72s)]
*  So along those lines, let's talk about pleasure. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1527.74s)]
*  With all the cells and tissues and machinery [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1530.48s)]
*  related to pain, you might think that our entire touch system [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1532.78s)]
*  is designed to allow us to detect pain [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1536.8s)]
*  and to avoid tissue damage. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1539.6s)]
*  And while a good percentage of it is devoted to that, [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1540.92s)]
*  a good percentage of it is also devoted [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1544.68s)]
*  to this thing that we call pleasure. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1546.72s)]
*  And that should come as no surprise. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1549.18s)]
*  Pleasure serves an adaptive role. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1551.5600000000002s)]
*  And that adaptive role relates to the fact [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1553.8200000000002s)]
*  that every species has a primary goal, [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1555.8400000000001s)]
*  which is to make more of itself. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1558.24s)]
*  Otherwise it would go extinct. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1560.18s)]
*  That process of making more of itself, sexual reproduction, [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1563.52s)]
*  is closely associated with the sensation [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1566.96s)]
*  and the perception of pleasure. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1569.72s)]
*  And it's no surprise that not only is the highest density [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1571.44s)]
*  of sensory receptors in and on and around the genitalia, [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1575.74s)]
*  but the process of reproduction evokes sensations [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1580.56s)]
*  and molecules and perceptions associated with pleasure. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1584.46s)]
*  And the currency of pleasure exists [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1587.8s)]
*  in multiple chemical systems, [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1590.76s)]
*  but the primary ones are the dopamine system, [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1592.52s)]
*  which is the anticipation of pleasure, [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1595.3s)]
*  and the work required to achieve the ability [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1598.08s)]
*  to experience that pleasure, and the serotonin system, [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1603.08s)]
*  which is more closely related [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1606.96s)]
*  to the immediate experience of that pleasure. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1608.48s)]
*  And from dopamine and serotonin stem out other hormones [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1610.92s)]
*  and molecules, things like oxytocin, [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1614.92s)]
*  which are associated with pair bonding. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1617.6s)]
*  Oxytocin is more closely associated [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1619.2s)]
*  with the serotonin system biochemically [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1621.4s)]
*  and at the circuit level, [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1623.96s)]
*  meaning the areas of the brain and body [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1625.58s)]
*  that manufacture a lot of serotonin, [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1627.26s)]
*  usually not always, but usually contain neurons [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1629.5s)]
*  that also manufacture and make use of the molecule oxytocin. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1631.6599999999999s)]
*  Those chemicals together create sensations of warmth, [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1636.82s)]
*  of well-being, of safety. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1640.82s)]
*  The dopamine molecule is more closely associated [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1643.8999999999999s)]
*  with hormones like testosterone [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1647.1599999999999s)]
*  and other molecules involved with pursuit [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1649.58s)]
*  and further effort in order to get more [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1652.34s)]
*  of whatever could potentially cause [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1655.3s)]
*  more release of dopamine. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1657.12s)]
*  So if levels of serotonin and dopamine are too low, [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1658.74s)]
*  it becomes almost impossible to experience pleasure. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1665.06s)]
*  There's a so-called a-hedonia. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1668.86s)]
*  This is also described as depression, [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1671.1599999999999s)]
*  although it needn't be long-term depression. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1673.22s)]
*  So certain drugs like antidepressants [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1676.06s)]
*  like Welbutrin, Bupriorone, as it's commonly called, [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1678.86s)]
*  or the so-called SSRIs, [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1683.58s)]
*  the serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors, [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1685.6999999999998s)]
*  excuse me, like Prozac, Zoloft, and similar, [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1688.98s)]
*  will increase dopamine and serotonin respectively. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1691.4199999999998s)]
*  They're not increasing the peaks in those molecules, [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1694.6599999999999s)]
*  what we call the acute release of those molecules. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1698.86s)]
*  What they're doing is they're raising [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1701.56s)]
*  the overall levels of those molecules. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1702.6999999999998s)]
*  They're raising the sort of foundation [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1704.86s)]
*  or the tide, if you will. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1706.96s)]
*  Think about it as your mood or your pleasure rather, [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1708.3799999999999s)]
*  as like a boat and if it's on the shore [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1711.34s)]
*  and it can't get out to sea unless that tide is high enough. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1713.74s)]
*  That's kind of the way to think about these tonic levels [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1716.54s)]
*  of dopamine and serotonin. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1718.86s)]
*  Now, most of us fortunately do not have problems [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1720.4199999999998s)]
*  with our baseline or our tonic levels [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1723.8999999999999s)]
*  of dopamine and serotonin release. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1726.54s)]
*  The brain and body use these common currencies [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1728.54s)]
*  for different experiences. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1731.1599999999999s)]
*  So yes, if your dopamine and serotonin, [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1732.58s)]
*  or I should say if your dopamine [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1735.26s)]
*  and or serotonin levels are too low, [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1736.74s)]
*  it will be very hard to achieve pleasure, [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1739.82s)]
*  to experience physical pleasure [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1741.86s)]
*  or emotional pleasure of any kind. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1743.5s)]
*  That's why treatments of the sort [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1745.7s)]
*  that I described a minute ago might be right for you. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1747.76s)]
*  Obviously, we can't determine if they're right for you. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1750.78s)]
*  It's also why they have side effects. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1752.54s)]
*  If you artificially increase these molecules [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1754.1799999999998s)]
*  that are associated with pleasure, [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1756.9399999999998s)]
*  oftentimes you get a lack of motivation [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1758.6599999999999s)]
*  to go seek things like food. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1761.0s)]
*  People don't get much interest in food [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1762.4199999999998s)]
*  because why should they if their serotonin levels [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1764.22s)]
*  are already up? [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1766.22s)]
*  Again, there's a ton of individual variation. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1767.32s)]
*  I don't want to say that these antidepressants [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1769.8799999999999s)]
*  are always bad. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1772.1599999999999s)]
*  Sometimes they've saved lives. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1773.3999999999999s)]
*  They've saved millions of lives. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1775.36s)]
*  Sometimes people have side effects [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1776.6799999999998s)]
*  that make them not the right choice. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1777.96s)]
*  So it has to be determined for the individual. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1779.58s)]
*  Just briefly, because it's relevant [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1781.9399999999998s)]
*  to the conversation that we've been having, [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1783.84s)]
*  you might want to be wary of any experience, [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1786.3999999999999s)]
*  any experience, no matter how it arrives, [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1790.0s)]
*  chemical, physical, emotional, or some combination. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1793.0s)]
*  You might want to be wary of letting your dopamine [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1796.76s)]
*  go too high, and certainly you want to be wary [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1799.2s)]
*  of it going too low because of the way [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1801.56s)]
*  that these circuits adjust. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1803.3s)]
*  Basically, every time that the pleasure system [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1804.84s)]
*  is kicked in in high gear, an absolutely spectacular event, [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1807.24s)]
*  you cannot be more ecstatic. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1812.48s)]
*  There is a mirror symmetric activation of the pain system. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1815.16s)]
*  And this might seem like an evil curse of biology, [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1820.36s)]
*  but it's not. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1824.04s)]
*  This is actually a way to protect this whole system [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1824.88s)]
*  of reward and motivation that I talked about [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1828.0400000000002s)]
*  at the beginning of the episode. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1830.2s)]
*  It might sound great to just ingest substances [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1832.44s)]
*  or engage in behaviors where it's just dopamine, dopamine, [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1834.68s)]
*  dopamine, and just constantly be motivated, [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1837.0800000000002s)]
*  but the system will eventually crash. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1839.72s)]
*  And so what happens is when you have a big increase [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1842.2800000000002s)]
*  in dopamine, you also will get a big increase [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1844.24s)]
*  in the circuits that underlie our sense of disappointment [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1847.1000000000001s)]
*  and readjusting the balance. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1851.22s)]
*  And with repeated exposure to high levels of dopamine, [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1853.24s)]
*  not naturally occurring wonderful events, [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1856.32s)]
*  but really high chemically induced peaks in dopamine, [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1859.0s)]
*  high magnitude chemically induced peaks in dopamine, [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1864.4s)]
*  what happens is those peaks in dopamine start to go down [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1867.52s)]
*  and down and down in response to the same, [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1870.74s)]
*  what ought to be incredible experience. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1873.56s)]
*  We start to what's called habituate or attenuate. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1876.08s)]
*  And yet the pain increases in size. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1879.68s)]
*  And this has a preservative function [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1884.0800000000002s)]
*  in keeping us safe, believe it or not. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1886.64s)]
*  But what I just described is actually the basis [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1889.28s)]
*  of most, if not all forms of addiction, [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1891.64s)]
*  something that we will deal with [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1894.4s)]
*  in a future episode in depth. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1895.66s)]
*  So today we talked about the pathways in the skin [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1897.5600000000002s)]
*  and in the brain and elsewhere in the body [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1900.96s)]
*  that control our sense of pleasure and pain. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1903.28s)]
*  We described a number of different tools [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1905.0800000000002s)]
*  ranging from different supplements [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1906.92s)]
*  to electro acupuncture and various other tools [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1908.36s)]
*  that one could use to modulate your sense [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1912.62s)]
*  of pleasure or pain. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1914.24s)]
*  And of course, in thinking about pleasure, [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1915.9799999999998s)]
*  we have to think about the dopamine system [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1918.1799999999998s)]
*  and the serotonin system [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1919.6399999999999s)]
*  and some of the related chemical systems. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1920.6799999999998s)]
*  I realized that today's podcast [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1922.8s)]
*  had a lot of scientific details. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1924.3s)]
*  I don't expect that everyone would be able to understand [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1926.1999999999998s)]
*  all these details all at once. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1928.7199999999998s)]
*  What's more important really is to understand [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1930.58s)]
*  the general principles of how something [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1933.76s)]
*  like pleasure and pain work, [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1935.9599999999998s)]
*  how they interact and the various cells and systems [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1937.56s)]
*  within the brain and body that allow them to occur [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1940.24s)]
*  and that modulate or change their ability to occur. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1942.6s)]
*  And of course, your subjective experience [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1946.36s)]
*  of pleasure or pain. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1948.32s)]
*  So I do hope that this was on whole more pleasureful [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1949.6s)]
*  than painful for you. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1953.08s)]
*  And last but not least, [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1954.3999999999999s)]
