Video Description: In this Huberman Lab Essentials episode, I explore how the auditory and vestibular (balance) systems are essential for enhancing learning and improving focus.

I explain how the auditory system captures sound waves and how the brain interprets these signals to make sense of the environment. I also discuss the use of white noise and binaural beats to support brain states conducive to learning, focus and relaxation. Additionally, I explain how the vestibular system helps maintain balance and examine practical tools to enhance auditory learning, cognitive performance and mood.

# How Hearing & Balance Enhance Focus & Learning | Huberman Lab Essentials
**Andrew Huberman:** [May 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw)
*  Welcome to Huberman Lab Essentials, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=0.0s)]
*  where we revisit past episodes [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=2.44s)]
*  for the most potent and actionable science-based tools [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=4.48s)]
*  for mental health, physical health, and performance. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=7.66s)]
*  I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=11.540000000000001s)]
*  and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  Today, we're going to talk all about hearing and balance [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=17.56s)]
*  and how you can use your ability to hear specific things [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=21.2s)]
*  and your balance system in order to learn anything faster. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=24.68s)]
*  The auditory system, meaning the hearing system, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=29.48s)]
*  and your balance system, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=32.02s)]
*  which is called the vestibular system, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=33.160000000000004s)]
*  interact with all the other systems of the brain and body [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=35.96s)]
*  and used properly can allow you [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  to learn information more quickly, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=41.72s)]
*  remember that information longer and with more ease. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=43.5s)]
*  And you can also improve the way you can hear. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  You can improve your balance. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=50.28s)]
*  We're going to talk about tools for all of that. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=51.92s)]
*  Can you hear me? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=54.88s)]
*  Can you hear me? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=56.620000000000005s)]
*  Okay, well, if you can hear me, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=58.019999999999996s)]
*  that's amazing because what it means is that my voice [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=59.32s)]
*  is causing little tiny changes in the airwaves, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=64.0s)]
*  wherever you happen to be, and that your ears [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  and whatever's contained in those ears and in your brain [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=70.52s)]
*  can take those sound waves and make sense of them. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=73.92s)]
*  And that is an absolutely fantastic [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=76.88s)]
*  and staggering feat of biology. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=79.56s)]
*  And yet we understand a lot about how that process works. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=82.2s)]
*  So what we call ears have a technical name. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=86.2s)]
*  That technical name is oracles, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=89.9s)]
*  but more often they're called pinna, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=92.76s)]
*  the pinna, P-I-N-N-A, pinna. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=95.04s)]
*  And the pinnas of your ears, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=98.48s)]
*  this outer part that is made of cartilage and stuff, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=101.08s)]
*  is arranged such that it can capture sound in the best way [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=105.12s)]
*  for your head size. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=109.32000000000001s)]
*  So the shape of these ears that we have [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=111.58s)]
*  is such that it amplifies high frequency sounds. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=115.44s)]
*  High frequency sounds, as the name suggests, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=118.26s)]
*  is the squeakier stuff. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=120.44s)]
*  So we have low frequency sounds and high frequency sounds [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=121.84s)]
*  and everything in between. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=124.28s)]
*  And those sound waves, for those of you that don't [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=125.80000000000001s)]
*  maybe fully conceptualize sound waves, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=129.04s)]
*  are literally just fluctuations or shifts [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=131.54s)]
*  in the way that air is moving toward your ear [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=135.92000000000002s)]
*  and through space. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=140.54000000000002s)]
*  In the same way that water can have waves, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=141.38s)]
*  the air can have waves, okay? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=143.64s)]
*  So it's reverberation of air. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=145.79999999999998s)]
*  Those come in through your ears [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=150.04s)]
*  and you have what's called your eardrum. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=152.23999999999998s)]
*  And on the inside of your eardrum, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=154.6s)]
*  there's a little bony thing that's shaped [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=157.07999999999998s)]
*  like a little hammer. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=159.2s)]
*  So attached to that eardrum, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=160.23999999999998s)]
*  which can move back and forth like a drum, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=162.32s)]
*  it's like a little membrane, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=164.48s)]
*  you've got this hammer attached to it. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=166.27999999999997s)]
*  And that hammer has three parts. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=168.2s)]
*  For those of you that want to know, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=170.11999999999998s)]
*  those three parts are called malleus, incus, and stapes. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=171.1s)]
*  But basically you can just think about it as a hammer. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=175.34s)]
*  So you've got this eardrum and then a hammer. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=177.29999999999998s)]
*  And then that hammer has to hammer on something. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=180.1s)]
*  And what it does is it hammers on a little coiled [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=182.85999999999999s)]
*  piece of tissue that we call the cochlea. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=186.96s)]
*  So this snail-shaped structure in your inner ear [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=189.54s)]
*  is where sound gets converted into electrical signals [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=193.5s)]
*  that the brain can understand. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=197.26s)]
*  Now, the cochlea at one end is more rigid than the other. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=199.26s)]
*  So one part can move really easily [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=204.85999999999999s)]
*  and the other part doesn't move very easily. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=206.7s)]
*  And that turns out to be very important for decoding [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=209.42s)]
*  or separating sounds that are low frequency [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=213.42s)]
*  and sounds that are of high frequency, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=216.66s)]
*  like a shriek or a shrill. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=219.18s)]
*  And that's because within that little coiled thing [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=221.89999999999998s)]
*  we call the cochlea, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=226.72s)]
*  you have all these tiny little, what are called hair cells. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=228.34s)]
*  Now they look like hairs, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=232.62s)]
*  but they're not at all related to the hairs on your head [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=234.02s)]
*  or elsewhere on your body. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=236.46s)]
*  They're just shaped like hairs. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=238.06s)]
*  We call them hair cells. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=239.26s)]
*  Those hair cells, if they move, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=241.54s)]
*  send signals into the brain that a particular sound [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=244.98000000000002s)]
*  is in our environment. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=248.34s)]
*  Now, this should stagger your mind. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=249.78s)]
*  If it doesn't already, it should. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=252.82s)]
*  Because what this means is that everything [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=254.88s)]
*  that's happening around us, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=258.02s)]
*  whether or not it's music or voices, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=259.21999999999997s)]
*  all of that is being broken down into its component parts. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=261.06s)]
*  And then your brain is making sense of what it means. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=265.34s)]
*  Your cochlea essentially acts as a prism. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=268.7s)]
*  It takes all the sound in your environment [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=271.85999999999996s)]
*  and it splits up those sounds into different frequencies. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=274.09999999999997s)]
*  And then the brain takes that information [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=277.65999999999997s)]
*  and puts it back together and makes sense of it. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=280.02s)]
*  So those hair cells in each of your two cochlea, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=282.5s)]
*  because you have two ears, you also have two cochlea, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=285.58s)]
*  send little wires, what we call axons, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=288.74s)]
*  that convey their patterns of activity into the brain. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=292.26s)]
*  And there are a number of different stations [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=296.97999999999996s)]
*  within the brain that information arrives at [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=299.58s)]
*  before it gets up to the parts of your brain [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=302.2s)]
*  where you are consciously aware. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=304.53999999999996s)]
*  And there is a good reason for that, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=306.65999999999997s)]
*  which is that more important than knowing [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=308.97999999999996s)]
*  what you're hearing, you need to know [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=311.98s)]
*  where it's coming from. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=314.26s)]
*  And our visual system can help with that, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=316.70000000000005s)]
*  but our auditory and our visual system collaborate [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=319.54s)]
*  to help us find and locate the position of things in space. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=322.1s)]
*  That should come as no surprise. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=326.90000000000003s)]
*  If you hear somebody talking off to your right, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=328.58000000000004s)]
*  you tend to turn to your right, not to your left. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=331.46000000000004s)]
*  If you see somebody's mouth moving in front of you, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=333.86s)]
*  you tend to assume that the sound is going to come [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=337.3s)]
*  from right in front of you. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=339.0s)]
*  Disruptions in this auditory hearing and visual matching [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=341.3s)]
*  are actually the basis of what's called [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=346.94s)]
*  the ventriloquism effect. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=348.74s)]
*  The ventriloquism effect can basically be described [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=350.22s)]
*  in simple terms as when you essentially think [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=353.46000000000004s)]
*  that a sound is coming from a location [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=357.70000000000005s)]
*  that it's not actually coming from. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=360.1s)]
*  The way you know where things are coming from, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=363.06s)]
*  what direction a car or a bus or a person is coming from [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=366.18s)]
*  is because the sound lands in one ear before the other. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=369.46s)]
*  And you have stations in your brain, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=373.18s)]
*  meaning you have neurons in your brain [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=375.85999999999996s)]
*  that calculate the difference in time of arrival [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=377.38s)]
*  for those sound waves in your right versus your left ear. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=380.06s)]
*  And if they arrive at the same time, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=383.53999999999996s)]
*  you assume that thing is making noise right in front of you. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=385.44s)]
*  If it's off to your right, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=389.17999999999995s)]
*  you assume it's over on your right. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=390.41999999999996s)]
*  And if the sound arrives first to your left ear, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=391.94s)]
*  you assume quite correctly [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=394.17999999999995s)]
*  that the thing is coming toward your left ear. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=396.02s)]
*  But what about up and down? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=398.82s)]
*  If you think about it, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=400.14s)]
*  a sound coming from above is going to land on your right ear [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=401.12s)]
*  and your left ear at the same time. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=403.78s)]
*  A sound from below is going to land on your right ear [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=406.65999999999997s)]
*  and your left ear at the same time. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=408.62s)]
*  So the way that we know where things are [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=410.42s)]
*  in terms of what's called elevation, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=413.58s)]
*  where they are in the up and down plane [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=416.1s)]
*  is by the frequencies. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=419.9s)]
*  The shape of your ears actually modifies the sound [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=422.2s)]
*  depending on whether or not it's coming straight at you [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=426.34s)]
*  from the floor or from high above. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=428.7s)]
*  Now this all happens very, very fast in a subconscious, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=431.59999999999997s)]
*  but now you know why. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=434.96s)]
*  If people really want to hear something, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=437.08s)]
*  they make a cup around their ear. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=439.53999999999996s)]
*  They essentially make their ear [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=442.46s)]
*  into more of a fennec fox type ear. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=444.14s)]
*  If you've ever seen those cute little fennec fox things, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=446.56s)]
*  they have these big spiky ears. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=449.2s)]
*  They kind of look like a French bulldog, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=450.65999999999997s)]
*  although they're kind of the fox version [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=452.28s)]
*  of the French bulldog. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=454.21999999999997s)]
*  These big, big tall ears [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=455.3s)]
*  and they have excellent sound localization. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=456.9s)]
*  And so when people lean in with their hand like this, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=459.06s)]
*  if you're listening to this, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=463.06s)]
*  I'm just cupping my hand at my ear, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=463.9s)]
*  I'm giving myself a bigger pinna. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=466.06s)]
*  Oh yeah, and if I do it on the left side, I can do this side. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=468.65999999999997s)]
*  And if I really want to hear something, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=471.14s)]
*  I do it on both sides. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=472.62s)]
*  Okay, so this isn't just gesturing. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=474.21999999999997s)]
*  This actually serves a mechanical role. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=476.15999999999997s)]
*  And actually, if you want to hear where things [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=478.21999999999997s)]
*  are coming from with a much greater degree of accuracy, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=480.26s)]
*  this can actually help [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=484.54s)]
*  because you're capturing sound waves [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=486.1s)]
*  and funneling them better. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=487.78000000000003s)]
*  So now I want to shift to talking about ways [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=489.38s)]
*  to leverage your hearing system, your auditory system, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=491.94s)]
*  so that you can learn anything, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=495.90000000000003s)]
*  not just auditory information, but anything faster. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=497.42s)]
*  I get a lot of questions about so-called binaural beats. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=501.46000000000004s)]
*  Binaural beats, as their name suggests, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=505.46000000000004s)]
*  involve playing one frequency of sound to one ear [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=507.76s)]
*  and a different frequency of sound to the other ear. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=512.02s)]
*  And the idea is that the brain will take [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=515.14s)]
*  those two frequencies of sound, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=518.34s)]
*  and because the pathways that bring information [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=521.42s)]
*  from the ears into the brain eventually cross over, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=524.36s)]
*  they actually share that information [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=526.98s)]
*  with both sides of the brain, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=529.04s)]
*  that the brain will average that information [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=530.74s)]
*  and come up with a sort of intermediate frequency. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=533.62s)]
*  And the rationale is that those intermediate frequencies [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=537.1s)]
*  place the brain into a state that is better for learning. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=540.46s)]
*  And when I say better for learning, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=544.58s)]
*  I want to be precise about what I mean. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=546.76s)]
*  That could mean more focus for encoding [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=548.72s)]
*  or bringing the information in. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=551.5s)]
*  As you may have heard me say before, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=554.9000000000001s)]
*  we have to be alert and focused in order to learn. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=556.82s)]
*  So can binaural beats make us more focused? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=560.02s)]
*  Can binaural beats allow us to relax more if we're anxious? [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=563.7800000000001s)]
*  So what do the scientific data say about binaural beats? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=567.74s)]
*  The science on binaural beats is actually quite extensive [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=570.42s)]
*  and very precise. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=573.5799999999999s)]
*  So sound waves are measured typically in hertz or kilohertz. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=575.36s)]
*  I know many of you aren't familiar with thinking [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=580.36s)]
*  about things in hertz or kilohertz, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=582.02s)]
*  but again, just remember those waves on a pond, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=583.76s)]
*  those ripples on a pond, if they're close together, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=586.54s)]
*  then they are of high frequency. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=590.5s)]
*  And if they're far apart, then they are low frequency. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=593.3s)]
*  So if it's many more kilohertz, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=595.54s)]
*  then it's much higher frequency [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=597.14s)]
*  than if it's fewer hertz or kilohertz. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=598.34s)]
*  And so you may have heard of these things as delta waves [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=600.3000000000001s)]
*  or theta waves or alpha waves or beta waves, et cetera. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=604.02s)]
*  Delta waves would be big slow waves, so low frequency. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=607.5s)]
*  And indeed, there is quality evidence [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=611.14s)]
*  from peer-reviewed studies that tell us that delta waves, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=614.46s)]
*  like one to four hertz, so very low frequency sounds, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=618.7800000000001s)]
*  can help in the transition to sleep and for staying asleep. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=621.94s)]
*  And that theta rhythms, which are more like four to eight [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=626.94s)]
*  hertz, can bring the brain into a state of subtle sleep [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=629.7800000000001s)]
*  or meditation, so deeply relaxed, but not fully asleep. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=636.22s)]
*  And you'll find evidence that alpha waves, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=639.94s)]
*  eight to 13 hertz, can increase alertness to a moderate level. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=641.94s)]
*  That's a great state for the brain to be in [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=646.3800000000001s)]
*  for recall of existing information, okay? [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=648.4200000000001s)]
*  And that beta waves, 15 to 20 hertz, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=652.5s)]
*  are great for bringing the brain into focus states [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=655.5s)]
*  for sustained thought or for incorporating new information, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=659.4s)]
*  and especially gamma waves, the highest frequency, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=663.74s)]
*  the most frequent ripples of sound, so to speak, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=666.18s)]
*  32 to 100 hertz for learning and problem solving. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=669.76s)]
*  Here, we're talking about the use of binaural beats [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=673.5s)]
*  in order to increase our level of alertness [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=675.8s)]
*  or our level of calmness. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=678.58s)]
*  Now, that's important to underscore, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=681.56s)]
*  because it's not that there's something [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=683.68s)]
*  fundamentally important about the binaural beats. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=685.12s)]
*  They are yet another way of bringing the brain [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=688.1999999999999s)]
*  into states of deep relaxation through low frequency sound, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=690.8s)]
*  or highly alert states for focused learning [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=694.9s)]
*  with more high frequency sound. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=698.8s)]
*  They're effective, but it's not that they're [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=700.8399999999999s)]
*  uniquely special for learning. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=703.3599999999999s)]
*  It's just that they can help some people [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=706.7199999999999s)]
*  bring their brain into the state [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=708.7199999999999s)]
*  that allows them to learn better. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=710.28s)]
*  There's very good evidence for anxiety reduction [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=713.68s)]
*  from the use of binaural beats. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=717.0799999999999s)]
*  And what's interesting is the anxiety reduction [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=719.7199999999999s)]
*  seems to be most effective when the binaural beats [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=723.7199999999999s)]
*  are bringing the brain into delta, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=728.4s)]
*  so those slow big waves like sleep, theta, and alpha states. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=730.7199999999999s)]
*  There's good evidence that binaural beats [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=735.9799999999999s)]
*  can be used to treat pain, chronic pain, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=737.4399999999999s)]
*  but the real boost from binaural beats [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=739.76s)]
*  appears to be for anxiety reduction and pain reduction. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=742.64s)]
*  Many people like binaural beats [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=746.84s)]
*  and say that they benefit from them, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=748.76s)]
*  especially while studying or learning. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=750.92s)]
*  I think part of the reason for that [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=753.62s)]
*  relates to the ability to channel our focus [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=755.72s)]
*  when we have some background noise. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=759.52s)]
*  And this is something I also get asked about a lot. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=761.56s)]
*  Is it better to listen to music and have background noise [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=764.3199999999999s)]
*  when studying, or is it better to have complete silence? [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=767.3199999999999s)]
*  Well, there's actually a quite good literature [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=770.0s)]
*  on this as well, but not so much as it relates [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=772.56s)]
*  to binaural beats, but rather whether or not [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=775.38s)]
*  people are listening to music, so-called white noise, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=777.8199999999999s)]
*  brown noise, believe it or not, there's white noise [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=781.68s)]
*  and there's brown noise, there's even pink noise. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=783.76s)]
*  I want to be very clear that white noise has been shown [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=786.0799999999999s)]
*  to really enhance brain states for learning [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=789.7199999999999s)]
*  in certain individuals, in particular in adults, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=793.28s)]
*  but white noise actually can have a detrimental effect [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=797.26s)]
*  on auditory learning and maybe even the development [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=800.28s)]
*  of the auditory system in very young children, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=802.8399999999999s)]
*  in particular in infants. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=805.68s)]
*  So first I'd like to talk about the beneficial effects [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=807.76s)]
*  of white noise on learning. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=810.68s)]
*  There are some really excellent studies on this. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=813.0799999999999s)]
*  The first one that I'd like to just highlight [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=816.24s)]
*  is one that's entitled, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=819.3199999999999s)]
*  Low Intensity White Noise Improves Performance [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=821.12s)]
*  in Auditory Working Memory Task, an FMRI study. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=823.6s)]
*  This is a study that explored whether or not learning [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=826.78s)]
*  could be enhanced by playing white noise in the background, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=831.98s)]
*  but the strength of the study is that they looked [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=836.9s)]
*  at some of the underlying neural circuitry [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=839.66s)]
*  and the activation of the neural circuitry in these people [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=841.42s)]
*  as they did the learning task. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=843.62s)]
*  And what it essentially illustrates is that white noise, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=845.14s)]
*  provided that white noise is of low enough intensity, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=849.02s)]
*  meaning not super loud, it actually could enhance learning [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=852.78s)]
*  to a significant degree. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=856.5s)]
*  And this has been shown now for a huge number [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=858.18s)]
*  of different types of learning. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=860.98s)]
*  I was very relieved to find, or I should say excited [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=863.26s)]
*  to find this study published [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=866.98s)]
*  in the Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=868.66s)]
*  This is a 2014 paper. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=870.94s)]
*  White noise improves learning by modulating activity [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=874.18s)]
*  in dopaminergic midbrain regions [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=877.18s)]
*  and the right superior temporal sulcus. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=879.86s)]
*  I don't expect you to know what the dopamine midbrain region [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=882.18s)]
*  is, but if you're like me, you probably took highlighted [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=884.54s)]
*  notice of the word dopaminergic. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=888.86s)]
*  Dopamine is a neuromodulator, meaning it's a chemical [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=890.98s)]
*  that's released in our brain and body, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=894.48s)]
*  but mostly in our brain, that modulates, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=896.18s)]
*  meaning controls the likelihood that certain brain areas [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=899.88s)]
*  will be active and other brain areas won't be active. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=903.88s)]
*  And dopamine is associated with motivation, [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=906.2199999999999s)]
*  dopamine is associated with craving. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=908.48s)]
*  But what's so interesting to me is that it appears [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=910.28s)]
*  that white noise itself can raise the, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=913.74s)]
*  what we call the basal, the baseline levels of dopamine [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=917.34s)]
*  that are being released from this area, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=920.4s)]
*  the substantia nigra. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=922.58s)]
*  So now we're starting to get a more full picture [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=924.4s)]
*  of how particular sounds in our environment [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=928.1s)]
*  can increase learning, and that's in part, I believe, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=930.78s)]
*  through the release of dopamine from substantia nigra. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=935.54s)]
*  So I'm not trying to shift you away from binaural beats, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=939.84s)]
*  if that's your thing, but it does appear [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=943.34s)]
*  that turning on white noise at a low level, [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=945.94s)]
*  but not too loud can allow you to learn better [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=948.26s)]
*  because of the ways that it's modulating [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=951.46s)]
*  your brain chemistry. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=953.38s)]
*  So what about white noise and hearing loss in development? [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=954.38s)]
*  I know a lot of people with children have these kind [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=957.98s)]
*  of noise machines, like sound waves and things like that, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=960.0600000000001s)]
*  that help the kids sleep. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=963.26s)]
*  And look, I think kids getting good sleep [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=964.98s)]
*  and parents getting good sleep is vital to physical [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=967.64s)]
*  and mental health and family health. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=970.5400000000001s)]
*  So I certainly sympathize with those needs. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=972.98s)]
*  However, there are data that indicate [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=977.9s)]
*  that white noise during development can be detrimental [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=981.02s)]
*  to the auditory system. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=985.02s)]
*  I don't want to frighten any parents [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=986.4200000000001s)]
*  if you played white noise to your kids. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=987.74s)]
*  This doesn't mean that their auditory system [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=989.5s)]
*  or their speech patterns are going to be disrupted [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=991.08s)]
*  or that their interpretation of speech [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=993.78s)]
*  is going to be disrupted forever. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=995.14s)]
*  But there are data published in the journal Science [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=996.9s)]
*  some years ago showing that when they exposed [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1000.66s)]
*  very young animals to this white noise, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1003.98s)]
*  it actually disrupted the maps of the auditory world [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1006.38s)]
*  within the brain. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1010.9399999999999s)]
*  So auditory information goes up into our cortex, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1012.2199999999999s)]
*  into essentially the outside portion of our brain [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1015.9599999999999s)]
*  that's responsible for all of our higher level cognition, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1019.4399999999999s)]
*  our planning, our decision-making, et cetera, creativity. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1023.2199999999999s)]
*  And up there we have what are called tonotopic maps, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1026.8999999999999s)]
*  what's a tonotopic map? [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1030.62s)]
*  Well, remember the cochlea, how it's coiled [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1032.06s)]
*  and at one end it responds to high frequencies [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1034.4199999999998s)]
*  and the other end it responds to low frequencies. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1036.3799999999999s)]
*  So we're like a piano. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1039.1999999999998s)]
*  In the auditory system, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1040.4199999999998s)]
*  we have what are called tonotopic maps [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1041.54s)]
*  where frequency, high frequency to low frequency [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1043.8999999999999s)]
*  and everything in between is organized [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1047.78s)]
*  in a very systematic way. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1049.6999999999998s)]
*  Now, our experience of life from the time we're a baby [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1051.78s)]
*  until the time that we die is not systematic. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1054.9799999999998s)]
*  We don't hear low frequencies at one part of the room [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1058.1s)]
*  or at one part of the day [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1060.6399999999999s)]
*  and high frequencies at another part of the room, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1061.5s)]
*  another part of the day, they're all intermixed. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1063.12s)]
*  But if you remember, the cochlea separates them out [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1065.84s)]
*  just like a prism of light separates out [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1068.9399999999998s)]
*  the different wavelengths of light, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1071.02s)]
*  the cochlea separates out the different frequencies. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1072.1999999999998s)]
*  And the developing brain takes those separated out [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1075.4399999999998s)]
*  frequencies and learns this relationship [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1079.34s)]
*  between itself, meaning the child and the outside world. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1082.4599999999998s)]
*  White noise essentially contains no tonotopic information. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1088.8799999999999s)]
*  The frequencies are all intermixed. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1094.02s)]
*  It's just noise. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1096.4599999999998s)]
*  So one of the reasons why hearing a lot of white noise [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1097.9599999999998s)]
*  during development for long periods of time [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1104.1599999999999s)]
*  can be detrimental to the development of the auditory system [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1106.1799999999998s)]
*  is that these tonotopic maps don't form normally. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1108.9399999999998s)]
*  At least they don't in experimental animals. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1111.6999999999998s)]
*  Now, the reason I'm raising this is that many people I know [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1113.6s)]
*  in particular friends who have small children, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1117.94s)]
*  they say, I want to use a white noise machine while I sleep, [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1120.3400000000001s)]
*  but is it okay for my baby to use a white noise machine? [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1126.54s)]
*  And I consulted with various people, scientists about this, [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1130.72s)]
*  and they said, well, you know, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1134.3s)]
*  the baby is also hearing the parents' voices [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1136.6200000000001s)]
*  and is hearing music and is hearing the dog bark. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1138.92s)]
*  So it's not the only thing they're hearing. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1141.06s)]
*  However, every single person that I consulted with said, [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1142.8600000000001s)]
*  but you know, there's neuroplasticity during sleep. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1147.34s)]
*  That's when the kid is sleeping. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1150.3799999999999s)]
*  And I don't know that you'd want to expose a child [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1152.22s)]
*  to white noise the entire night [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1155.02s)]
*  because it might degrade that tonotopic map. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1157.1399999999999s)]
*  It might not destroy it. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1160.8999999999999s)]
*  It might not eliminate it, [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1162.4199999999998s)]
*  but it could make it a little less clear, [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1163.4399999999998s)]
*  like sort of taking the keys on the piano [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1166.58s)]
*  and taping a few of them together. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1169.5s)]
*  Once your auditory system has formed, [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1171.4199999999998s)]
*  once it's established these tonotopic maps, [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1173.86s)]
*  then the presence of background white noise [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1176.02s)]
*  should not be a problem at all. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1178.54s)]
*  In fact, it shouldn't be a problem at all [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1180.1s)]
*  because you're also not attending to it. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1182.62s)]
*  The idea is that it's playing at a low enough volume [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1184.68s)]
*  that you kind of forget it in the background [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1186.84s)]
*  and that it's supporting learning by bringing your brain [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1188.46s)]
*  into a heightened state of alertness [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1191.34s)]
*  and especially this heightened state of dopamine, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1192.58s)]
*  dopaminergic activation of the brain, [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1195.02s)]
*  which will make it easier to learn faster [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1197.18s)]
*  and easier to learn the information. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1199.74s)]
*  So now I want to talk about auditory learning [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1201.76s)]
*  and actually how you can get better [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1204.42s)]
*  at learning information that you hear, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1206.0600000000002s)]
*  not just information that you see on a page [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1208.02s)]
*  or motor skill learning. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1210.94s)]
*  So there's a phenomenon called the cocktail party effect. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1212.8600000000001s)]
*  Now, even if you've never been to a cocktail party, [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1216.5800000000002s)]
*  you've experienced and participated [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1218.68s)]
*  in what's called the cocktail party effect. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1221.42s)]
*  The cocktail party effect is where you are [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1223.54s)]
*  in an environment that's rich with sound, [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1225.46s)]
*  many sound waves coming from many different sources, [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1227.74s)]
*  many different things. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1230.38s)]
*  So in a city, in a classroom, in a car [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1231.22s)]
*  that contains people having various conversations, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1234.7s)]
*  you somehow need to be able to attend [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1238.14s)]
*  to specific components of those sound waves, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1241.18s)]
*  meaning you need to hear certain people and not others. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1243.52s)]
*  You and your brain are exquisitely good [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1246.1000000000001s)]
*  at creating a cone of auditory attention, [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1251.1000000000001s)]
*  a narrow band of attention [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1254.74s)]
*  with which you can extract the information you care about [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1256.74s)]
*  and wipe away or erase all the rest. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1259.86s)]
*  Now, this takes work, it takes attention. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1264.26s)]
*  One of the reasons why you might come home [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1267.4399999999998s)]
*  from a loud gathering, maybe a stadium, a sports event [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1269.5s)]
*  or a cocktail party for that matter, [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1273.06s)]
*  and feel just exhausted is because if you were listening [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1274.82s)]
*  to conversations there or trying to listen [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1277.6599999999999s)]
*  to those conversations while watching the game, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1279.58s)]
*  it takes attentional effort [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1281.5s)]
*  and the brain uses up a lot of energy just at rest, [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1283.34s)]
*  but it uses up even more energy [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1288.4599999999998s)]
*  when you are paying strong attention to something, [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1290.8999999999999s)]
*  literally caloric energy, [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1293.1s)]
*  burning up things like glucose, et cetera. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1294.62s)]
*  Even if you're ketogenic, it's burning up energy. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1296.4599999999998s)]
*  So the cocktail party effect has been studied extensively [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1299.62s)]
*  in the field of neuroscience. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1303.62s)]
*  And we now know at a mechanistic level [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1304.6999999999998s)]
*  how one accomplishes this feat of attending [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1307.3999999999999s)]
*  to certain sounds despite the fact [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1310.1599999999999s)]
*  that we are being bombarded with all sorts of other sounds. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1312.3799999999999s)]
*  So there are a couple of ways that we do this. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1316.1999999999998s)]
*  First of all, much as with our visual system, [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1317.7s)]
*  we can expand or contract our visual field of view. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1322.8s)]
*  Okay, we can do that. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1328.74s)]
*  We can expand and contract our visual field of view. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1329.5800000000002s)]
*  Well, we can expand and contract our auditory field of view, [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1331.48s)]
*  so to speak, or our auditory window. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1337.46s)]
*  We can really hear one person or a small number of people [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1339.94s)]
*  amidst a huge background of chatter [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1343.64s)]
*  because we pay attention to the onset of words, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1346.32s)]
*  but also to the offset of words. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1351.46s)]
*  So one of the more common phenomena [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1354.74s)]
*  that I think we all experience is you go to a party [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1357.98s)]
*  and or you meet somebody new and you say, [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1360.98s)]
*  hi, I would say, hi, I'm Andrew. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1363.3799999999999s)]
*  And they'd say, hi, I'm Jeff, for instance. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1364.8799999999999s)]
*  I said, great, great to meet you. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1367.28s)]
*  And then a minute later, I can't remember the guy's name. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1368.1799999999998s)]
*  Now, is it because I don't care what his name is? [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1371.4399999999998s)]
*  No. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1373.1799999999998s)]
*  Somehow the presence of other auditory information [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1374.02s)]
*  interfered. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1377.08s)]
*  It's not that my mind was necessarily someplace else. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1377.92s)]
*  It's that the signal to noise, as we say, [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1380.26s)]
*  wasn't high enough. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1383.32s)]
*  Somehow the way he said it or the way it landed on my ears, [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1385.04s)]
*  which is really all that matters, right? [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1389.96s)]
*  When it comes down to learning is such that it just didn't [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1392.2s)]
*  achieve high enough signal to noise. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1396.32s)]
*  So the next time you ask somebody's name, [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1398.8799999999999s)]
*  remember, listen to the onset of what they say [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1400.52s)]
*  and the offset. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1403.12s)]
*  So this would be paying attention to the je in Jeff, [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1404.94s)]
*  and it would be paying attention to the f in F in Jeff, [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1407.0s)]
*  excuse me. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1410.54s)]
*  All right. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1411.76s)]
*  And chances are you'll be able to remember that name. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1412.6000000000001s)]
*  Now I do acknowledge that trying to learn every word [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1415.8600000000001s)]
*  in a sentence by paying attention to its onset and offset [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1418.9s)]
*  could actually be kind of disruptive to the learning [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1422.9s)]
*  process. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1424.8600000000001s)]
*  So this would be more for specific attention. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1426.1200000000001s)]
*  Using the attentional system, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1428.66s)]
*  we can actually learn much faster [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1430.6200000000001s)]
*  and we can actually activate neuroplasticity [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1433.3s)]
*  in the adult brain, [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1436.6s)]
*  something that's very challenging to do. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1437.48s)]
*  And that the auditory system is one of the main ways [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1439.9199999999998s)]
*  in which we can access neuroplasticity more broadly. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1443.3999999999999s)]
*  I'd like to now talk about balance [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1446.6s)]
*  and our sense of balance, [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1448.44s)]
*  which is controlled by, believe it or not, [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1450.56s)]
*  our ears and things in our ears, [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1453.8s)]
*  as well as by our brain and elements of our spinal cord. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1456.72s)]
*  The reason why we're talking about balance [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1461.08s)]
*  and how to get better at balancing in the episode [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1462.72s)]
*  about hearing is that all the goodies [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1465.3600000000001s)]
*  that are going to allow you to do that are in your ears. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1468.3s)]
*  They're also in your brain, [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1473.22s)]
*  but they're mostly in your ears. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1474.72s)]
*  So as you recall from the beginning of this episode, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1477.1000000000001s)]
*  you have two cochlea, cochleas, [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1479.34s)]
*  that are one on each side of your head. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1482.18s)]
*  And that's a little spiral snail shape thing [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1485.02s)]
*  that converts sound waves into electrical signals [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1487.18s)]
*  that the rest of your brain can understand. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1490.06s)]
*  Right next to those, [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1492.76s)]
*  you have what are called semicircular canals. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1494.1s)]
*  The semicircular canals can be best visualized [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1498.32s)]
*  as thinking about three hula hoops with marbles in them. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1500.84s)]
*  So imagine that you have a hula hoop [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1504.76s)]
*  and it's not filled with marbles all the way around. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1507.72s)]
*  It's just got some marbles down there at the base. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1510.8s)]
*  Okay, so if you were to move that hula hoop around, [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1513.9199999999998s)]
*  one of those hula hoops is positioned vertically [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1516.7s)]
*  with respect to gravity, but basically it's upright. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1521.44s)]
*  Another one of those hula hoops [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1524.4s)]
*  is basically at a 90 degree angle, [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1526.66s)]
*  basically parallel to the floor [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1531.16s)]
*  if you're standing upright now, if you're seated. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1533.3s)]
*  Okay, and the other one is kind of tilted [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1536.4s)]
*  about 45 degrees in between those. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1540.76s)]
*  Now, why is the system there? [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1543.7s)]
*  Well, those marbles within each one of those hula hoops [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1546.42s)]
*  can move around, but they'll only move around [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1548.8400000000001s)]
*  if your head moves in a particular way. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1553.28s)]
*  And there are three planes or three ways [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1555.2s)]
*  that your head can move. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1558.0800000000002s)]
*  Your head can move up and down like I'm nodding right now. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1559.88s)]
*  So that's called pitch, [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1563.64s)]
*  or I can shake my head no, side to side. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1565.2s)]
*  That's called yaw. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1568.2s)]
*  And then there's roll, tilting the head from side to side, [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1569.64s)]
*  the way that a cute puppy might look at you [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1573.58s)]
*  from side to side. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1576.1599999999999s)]
*  Pitch, yaw, and roll are the movements of the head [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1577.3999999999999s)]
*  in each of the three major planes of motion, as we say. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1580.6399999999999s)]
*  And each one of those causes those marbles to move [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1583.96s)]
*  in one or two of the various hula hoops, okay? [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1588.3999999999999s)]
*  They aren't actually marbles, by the way. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1592.72s)]
*  These are little, kind of like little stones, basically, [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1594.58s)]
*  little calcium-like deposits. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1599.6799999999998s)]
*  And when they roll back and forth, [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1602.4s)]
*  they deflect little hairs, little hair cells [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1605.18s)]
*  that aren't like the hair cells [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1609.14s)]
*  that we use for measuring sound waves. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1610.3000000000002s)]
*  But they're basically rolling past these little hair cells [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1612.38s)]
*  and causing them to deflect. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1616.22s)]
*  And when they deflect downward, the neurons, [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1617.88s)]
*  because hair cells are neurons, [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1621.46s)]
*  send information up to the brain. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1622.6200000000001s)]
*  So if I move my head like this, [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1626.02s)]
*  there's a physical movement of these little stones [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1627.8000000000002s)]
*  in this hula hoop, as I'm referring to it. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1630.86s)]
*  But they deflect these hairs, send those hairs, [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1633.7199999999998s)]
*  which are neurons, those hair cells, [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1637.04s)]
*  send information off to the brain. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1638.76s)]
*  Any animal that has a jaw has this so-called balance system, [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1640.4399999999998s)]
*  which we call the vestibular system. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1644.26s)]
*  One of the more important things to know [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1646.1599999999999s)]
*  about the vestibular, the balance system, [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1648.0s)]
*  is that it works together with the visual system. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1650.36s)]
*  Let's say I hear something off to my left [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1655.9599999999998s)]
*  and I swing my head over to the left to see what it is. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1657.92s)]
*  There are two sources of information [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1661.94s)]
*  about where my head is relative to my body, [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1663.6200000000001s)]
*  and I need to know that. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1665.96s)]
*  First of all, when I quickly move my head to the side, [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1667.8600000000001s)]
*  those little stones, as I'm referring to them, [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1671.8000000000002s)]
*  they quickly activate those hair cells [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1674.26s)]
*  in that one semicircular canal [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1677.22s)]
*  and send a signal off to my brain [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1679.74s)]
*  that my head just moved to the side. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1681.7s)]
*  But also visual information slid past my field of view. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1683.18s)]
*  I didn't have to think about it, [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1687.86s)]
*  but just slid past my field of view. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1688.8799999999999s)]
*  And when those two signals combine, [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1690.8s)]
*  my eyes then locked to a particular location. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1694.84s)]
*  Now, if this is at all complicated, [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1697.76s)]
*  you can actually uncouple these things. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1700.3999999999999s)]
*  It's very easy to do. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1702.9199999999998s)]
*  If you get the opportunity, [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1705.1599999999999s)]
*  you can do this safely wherever you are, [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1706.0s)]
*  you're going to stand up [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1707.3999999999999s)]
*  and you're going to look forward about 10, 12 feet. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1708.6799999999998s)]
*  You can pick a point on a wall, [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1711.4399999999998s)]
*  stand on one leg and lift up the other leg. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1712.6399999999999s)]
*  You can bend your knee if you like, [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1716.24s)]
*  and just look off into the distance about 10, 12 feet. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1717.68s)]
*  If you can do that, [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1722.6200000000001s)]
*  if you can stand on one leg, now close your eyes. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1723.46s)]
*  Chances are you're going to suddenly feel [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1726.9s)]
*  what scientists call postural sway. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1729.3s)]
*  It is very hard to balance with your eyes closed. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1731.54s)]
*  You might think, well, and if you think about that, [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1735.54s)]
*  it's like, why is that? [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1736.8600000000001s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1738.14s)]
*  Why would it be that it's hard to balance [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1739.1000000000001s)]
*  with your eyes closed? [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1740.94s)]
*  Well, information about the visual world [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1741.78s)]
*  also feeds back onto this vestibular system. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1744.84s)]
*  So the vestibular system informs your vision [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1747.78s)]
*  and tells you where to move your eyes [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1749.76s)]
*  and your eyes in their positioning, [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1751.1599999999999s)]
*  tell your balance system, your vestibular system, [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1753.12s)]
*  how it should function. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1756.04s)]
*  So up until now, I've been talking about balance [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1757.6399999999999s)]
*  only in the static sense, [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1759.52s)]
*  like standing on one leg, for instance, [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1760.8799999999999s)]
*  but that's a very artificial situation. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1762.6399999999999s)]
*  Even though you can train balance that way, [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1765.24s)]
*  most people who want to enhance their sense of balance [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1767.36s)]
*  for sport or dance or some other endeavor [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1770.02s)]
*  want to engage balance in a dynamic way, [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1773.0s)]
*  meaning moving through lots of different planes of movement. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1775.72s)]
*  For that, we need to consider that the vestibular system [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1778.46s)]
*  also cares about acceleration. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1782.64s)]
*  So it cares about head position, [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1785.34s)]
*  it cares about eye position and where the eyes are [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1786.74s)]
*  and where you're looking, [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1789.34s)]
*  but it also cares about what direction you're moving [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1790.5s)]
*  and how fast. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1793.64s)]
*  And one of the best things that you can do [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1795.14s)]
*  to enhance your sense of balance [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1798.22s)]
*  is to start to bring together your visual system, [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1800.66s)]
*  the semicircular canals of the inner ear [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1805.2s)]
*  and what we call linear acceleration. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1808.0800000000002s)]
*  So if I move forward in space rigidly upright, [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1810.8600000000001s)]
*  it's a vastly different situation [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1814.68s)]
*  than if I'm leaning to the side. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1816.8000000000002s)]
*  One of the best ways to cultivate [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1820.4s)]
*  a better sense of balance, literally, [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1823.22s)]
*  within the sense organs and the neurons [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1826.0400000000002s)]
*  and the biology of the brain [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1828.8s)]
*  is to get into modes where we are accelerating forward, [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1831.68s)]
*  typically it's forward, [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1836.46s)]
*  while also tilted with respect to gravity. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1837.74s)]
*  Now, this would be the carve on a skateboard [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1841.44s)]
*  or on a surfboard or a snowboard. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1844.28s)]
*  This would be the taking a corner on a bike [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1846.52s)]
*  while being able to lean safely, of course, [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1850.04s)]
*  lean into the turn so that your head is actually tilted [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1852.56s)]
*  with respect to the earth. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1856.28s)]
*  The head being tilted and the body being tilted [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1858.16s)]
*  while in acceleration, typically forward acceleration, [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1860.2s)]
*  but sometimes side to side has a profound [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1863.26s)]
*  and positive effect on our sense of mood and wellbeing. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1866.8400000000001s)]
*  And as I talked about in previous episode, [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1870.3200000000002s)]
*  it can also enhance our ability to learn information [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1872.9s)]
*  in the period after generating those tilts [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1876.24s)]
*  and the acceleration. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1879.66s)]
*  And that's because the cerebellum has these outputs [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1881.44s)]
*  to these areas of the brain [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1883.8600000000001s)]
*  that release these neuromodulators [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1884.92s)]
*  like serotonin and dopamine, [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1886.52s)]
*  and they make us feel really good. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1888.8s)]
*  Those modes of exercise seem to have an outsized effect [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1891.9s)]
*  both on our wellbeing and our ability [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1896.6s)]
*  to translate the vestibular balance [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1899.16s)]
*  that we achieve in those endeavors [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1902.6399999999999s)]
*  to our ability to balance while doing other things. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1904.44s)]
*  So I encourage people to get into modes of acceleration [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1908.1s)]
*  while tilted every once in a while, [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1911.8799999999999s)]
*  provided you can do it safely. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1913.42s)]
*  It's an immensely powerful way to build up your skills [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1914.8s)]
*  in the realm of balance. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1918.72s)]
*  And it's also for most people, very, very pleasing. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1920.28s)]
*  It feels really good because of the chemical relationship [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1924.1599999999999s)]
*  between forward acceleration and head tilt and body tilt. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1926.76s)]
*  Once again, we've covered a tremendous amount [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1931.1599999999999s)]
*  of information. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1933.12s)]
*  Now you know how you hear, [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1934.6399999999999s)]
*  how you make sense of the sounds in your environment, [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1936.28s)]
*  how those come into your ears [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1939.8799999999999s)]
*  and how your brain processes them. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1941.3999999999999s)]
*  In addition, we talked about things [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1943.76s)]
*  like low-level white noise and even binaural beats, [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1945.42s)]
*  which can be used to enhance certain brain states, [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1948.44s)]
*  certain rhythms within the brain, [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1951.08s)]
*  and even dopamine release in ways [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1952.68s)]
*  that allow you to learn better. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1954.92s)]
*  And we talked about the balance system [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1957.16s)]
*  and this incredible relationship [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1958.84s)]
*  between your vestibular apparatus, [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1960.64s)]
*  meaning the portions of your inner ear [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1963.28s)]
*  that are responsible for balance [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1965.48s)]
*  and your visual system and gravity. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1966.84s)]
*  And you can use those to enhance your learning as well, [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1969.8s)]
*  as well as just to enhance your sense of balance. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1973.12s)]
*  Last but not least, [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1975.9199999999998s)]
*  I'd like to thank you for your time and attention [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1976.82s)]
*  and desire and willingness to learn [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1979.2199999999998s)]
*  about vision and balance. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1981.32s)]
*  And of course, thank you for your interest in science. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1983.1599999999999s)]
*  ["Science Files"] [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1985.76s)]
