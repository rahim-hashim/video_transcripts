Video Description: Welcome to a special edition of the 18th Ask Me Anything (AMA) episode, part of Huberman Lab Premium. This episode is a recording of the live stream AMA, exclusive to our Premium members. We've decided to make the full-length version available to everyone, including non-members of Huberman Lab Premium.

Huberman Lab Premium was launched for two main reasons. First, it was launched in order to raise support for the main Huberman Lab podcast — which will continue to come out every Monday at zero-cost. Second, it was launched as a means to raise funds for important scientific research. A significant portion of proceeds from the Huberman Lab Premium subscription will fund human research (not animal models) selected by Dr. Huberman, with a dollar-for-dollar match from the Tiny Foundation and other donors.

If you're not yet a member but enjoyed this full-length livestream AMA, we invite you to join Huberman Lab Premium. By subscribing, you'll gain access to exclusive benefits including our regular monthly full-length AMA episodes, AMA transcripts, podcast episode transcripts, early access to live events and more. Additionally, a significant portion of your membership proceeds contributes to advancing human scientific research. You can learn more about the research we were able to support in our Annual Letter 2023: https://www.hubermanlab.com/annual-letter/2023

# AMA #18 Cold Therapy Advice, Skin Health Tips, Motivation, Learning Strategies & More
**Andrew Huberman:** [August 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf-kC30SLtc)
*  Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
*  where we discuss science
*  and science-based tools for everyday life.
*  Hi, everyone.
*  I'm delighted to kick off this premium subscriber AMA.
*  And today I have some great announcements to make,
*  including the fact that we have now expanded our SciComm,
*  that is the parent company of the Huberman Lab Podcast.
*  As some of you know,
*  we've expanded our SciComm Huberman Lab Podcast philanthropy
*  to support great, exciting science
*  that is going to directly relate to mental health,
*  physical health, and performance tools
*  in the very near future.
*  And we've been able to do that thanks to all of you,
*  because we use a significant portion of the funds
*  from the premium channel subscribers
*  to support exciting work on humans.
*  So these are laboratories working on questions
*  such as improving mental health, physical health,
*  and performance from a variety of approaches
*  at all major universities.
*  And we've supported work at Stanford, Columbia University,
*  University of Oregon coming up.
*  We're actually supporting some programs
*  related to student training and teaching
*  in the realm of neuroscience and happiness.
*  So some really exciting groundbreaking areas
*  all made possible thanks to you
*  and the fact that we now have three dollar-for-dollar matches
*  from exceptional donors.
*  When we started this premium subscription model
*  to support science, we had one still,
*  have this one absolutely spectacular
*  dollar-for-dollar donor match from the Tiny Foundation,
*  and now two others have joined in.
*  So for every dollar that is used from the premium channel
*  to support these exciting areas of research,
*  we now have $3 being donated to match that dollar.
*  So we essentially have a 4X what we would otherwise give
*  in terms of supporting exciting new research on humans
*  in various laboratories at Stanford and elsewhere.
*  I'll just touch on a few areas
*  that we are supporting going forward.
*  This is not an exhaustive list, but for instance,
*  we are supporting some exciting work
*  using deliberate heat exposure
*  to treat symptoms of depression,
*  a really interesting and forward-looking approach
*  to treating depression for which there's already
*  some really exciting preliminary results.
*  We are going to be supporting work on goal setting
*  at New York University.
*  This is really exciting work.
*  Many, many people struggle with goal setting
*  and habit formation that can serve them in their career
*  and in their personal life and fitness goals, health goals.
*  This work directly relates to that.
*  In other words, you're supporting that work.
*  We are also supporting work on immune system,
*  nervous system interactions.
*  This is an area of science
*  that's now really progressing quickly
*  that explores how especially in babies and kids
*  and young adults, but also in more mature adults,
*  interactions between the brain and nervous system
*  and the immune system can cause all sorts
*  of interesting susceptibilities,
*  but also patterns of resilience in people
*  that do specific things as it relates
*  to supporting their immune system.
*  So thanks to you and these dollar for dollar matching donors,
*  we are able together, but mainly thanks to you,
*  to support these exciting areas of human research.
*  And as the data come in,
*  we are going to relay what the new findings are
*  and of course, translate those where appropriate
*  to protocols for improving mental health,
*  physical health and performance.
*  So I want to extend a deep, deep, deep message of gratitude
*  to you for supporting science, for supporting new research
*  and for supporting the evolution of new data
*  to serve humanity.
*  Thank you ever so much.
*  Okay, so without further ado,
*  let's get to answering your questions about mental health,
*  physical health and performance.
*  The first question comes from Robert.
*  And the question is, is there any way
*  to repair thinning skin as we age?
*  I'm 77 years old and in the last few years,
*  the skin on my arms has gotten noticeably thinner.
*  Thank you.
*  Well, thank you for this question.
*  It's a very timely question,
*  given that we just had a solo episode.
*  I did a solo episode about skin health
*  and appearance on the podcast.
*  I should mention that that episode was reviewed
*  by a derm oncologist.
*  I consulted with different dermatologists
*  prior to that episode.
*  And my general sense is that it's been received very well.
*  There are a few areas within the skin health
*  and appearance field that are of controversy,
*  mainly around sunscreens.
*  I'll just go on record saying that it's very clear
*  that excessive sun exposure will age skin more rapidly.
*  Okay, that's just categorically true.
*  Okay, so if anyone's debating that,
*  there's an issue there, right?
*  There shouldn't be any debate about that.
*  It's absolutely true that sunscreen can help.
*  And there are sort of three major forms of sunscreen.
*  This relates to how to protect skin from thinning.
*  One is a physical barrier.
*  Pretty much nobody disputes a physical barrier,
*  a hat, a long sleeve shirt, long pants, et cetera.
*  However, those don't always cover all the areas
*  of the body that need sun protection,
*  such as the ears, the back of the neck,
*  portions of the face and so forth.
*  When it comes to sunscreen, sometimes called sunblocks,
*  I think there's general agreement that the sunscreens,
*  and I'll use sunscreen and sunblock interchangeably,
*  that are mineral-based, that is inorganic,
*  meaning that the active ingredients are either zinc oxide
*  or titanium dioxide or some combination of those
*  up to a concentration of 25% are generally deemed safe
*  by most all dermatologists.
*  Now, there are some people who will point out
*  that there's some controversy around certain forms
*  of titanium dioxide.
*  The evidence for that, however, is not conclusive.
*  I would say that if you're really, really concerned
*  about any of that, then just stick
*  with a pure zinc oxide formula up to 25%.
*  Why would people not use zinc oxide formulas?
*  Well, they tend to be kind of pasty
*  and they don't spread on very easily
*  compared to some other sunscreen formulas.
*  Sunscreens that are quote unquote chemical-based, okay,
*  one will say, well, everything is a chemical, yes,
*  but are chemical-based.
*  They use a different approach to blocking or reflecting
*  or absorbing UV rays.
*  Those do indeed have some controversy around them.
*  There are a few studies in which very large amounts
*  of those chemical-containing sunscreens,
*  these are chemicals like oxybenzene, et cetera,
*  are applied to the skin,
*  and they do make it into general circulation.
*  They do blood draws.
*  They see that some of these chemicals
*  can be endocrine disruptors,
*  leading some people to believe that chemical-based
*  or sunscreens that contain some of these chemicals
*  are to be avoided.
*  Now, I want to be very clear on my stance,
*  which is if you need sun protection
*  and the choice is either to use those types
*  of sunscreens occasionally versus no sun protection,
*  I would say probably better to just use them.
*  But if you are picking a sunscreen, AK sunblock,
*  where you are going to be using it all summer
*  or very frequently, well, in that case,
*  probably best to go with a mineral-based sunscreen
*  because you'll be doing more frequent exposure application.
*  And then of course, there are people that will argue
*  that the chemical-based sunscreens are in fact fine.
*  And if that's your threshold,
*  meaning that there isn't enough conclusive evidence
*  that they're problematic, then that's fine.
*  So those are the three general categories,
*  but yes, sun will damage the skin.
*  That doesn't mean you shouldn't get any sun exposure
*  to your skin.
*  Turns out that generating vitamin D, of course,
*  getting your circadian rhythms right,
*  hormone production, et cetera,
*  actually requires some exposure to sunlight.
*  You just don't want to do it during the highest UV
*  index portions of the day, like the middle of the day.
*  You don't want to burn.
*  However, and please note this,
*  you do not have to burn in order to put yourself
*  at a greater risk for skin cancer.
*  So, avoid burns, but avoid excessive sun exposure
*  for you as well.
*  Now, back to Robert's question.
*  The skin is thinning.
*  Why is it thinning?
*  Well, as we get older, the composition of the proteins
*  in skin, and there are many different proteins,
*  but in particular, the collagen and elastins
*  start to either mutate or weaken.
*  There could be less production of these.
*  The skin sometimes loses moisture as well.
*  And the basic solution to this is the following.
*  We know that sun protection will help.
*  We also know, and I covered this in the episode,
*  that there's some evidence, okay?
*  I would say it's moderate evidence.
*  It's not extremely strong.
*  It's not weak.
*  That ingestion of collagen proteins, believe it or not,
*  can improve skin elasticity and the appearance
*  of smoothness and plumpness,
*  as it's subjectively rated in these studies.
*  You might ask yourself, well, how is that?
*  Is it that you ingest collagen?
*  And by the way, people typically do this at dosages
*  of anywhere from, you'll see as low as five grams per day,
*  but as high as 30 grams per day of collagen protein.
*  Typically, there's some vitamin C in there as well,
*  which seems to help its absorption or utilization.
*  And they will observe in these studies,
*  over time, some improved elasticity,
*  appearance of smoothness and plumpness of the skin.
*  So should you ingest collagen protein?
*  Well, the results are, again, statistically significant,
*  but they're not overwhelming in the sense
*  that you're not going to reverse all the thinning
*  and kind of what appears to be a little kind of local sagging
*  of the skin completely.
*  By ingesting collagen, but it can help.
*  Collagen can be ingested through things like bone broth.
*  By the way, collagen is a composition of not just skin,
*  but of tendon and ligaments and things of that sort.
*  Typically, people will get their collagen in powdered form.
*  It's relatively inexpensive.
*  There are a lot of different forms of this,
*  from fish, from animal sources.
*  There are some plant-based sources.
*  It's a little unclear whether or not those are as good.
*  But in any event, five to 30 grams,
*  typically 15 to 30 grams in most of the studies
*  does seem to be moderately effective
*  in improving skin elasticity, plumpness
*  and appearance of smoothness.
*  Okay, so that's one area.
*  The other area where there's some interesting research
*  is red light exposure.
*  So red light exposure is an interesting one
*  because of course in sunlight, we have full spectrum light.
*  Right, if you ever put a prism out
*  and you get a light beam through it,
*  you need to get the rainbow, right?
*  It includes red.
*  There are long wavelengths, AKA red.
*  Wavelengths of light.
*  I pause as I say red wavelengths
*  because they're actually long wavelengths of light
*  that appear red.
*  And it has been shown that light panels
*  that are emitting red light or near infrared light
*  are typically both, can also improve skin appearance
*  if done for about 10 to 15 minutes per day,
*  maybe five days per week minimum
*  over the course of a few months.
*  Again, the results in those studies
*  are statistically significant in many of those studies.
*  And I would place them in kind of the moderate result,
*  meaning it's not a striking result,
*  but you could imagine combining red light with the collagen.
*  So you start to get perhaps a synergistic effect,
*  but those studies combining them have not been done.
*  It does seem that one of the best,
*  that is dermatologists supported ways
*  to improve skin appearance is to ingest a retinoid.
*  Now these are prescription drugs.
*  The retinoids do require that, you know,
*  you work with a qualified dermatologist.
*  They require that you stay out of the sun
*  for some period of time
*  because they can increase sensitivity to the sun,
*  but they will improve collagen composition
*  and that's from the inside out.
*  So, and by the way,
*  there are also some different supplements
*  that one can take that can protect your skin
*  so that you don't have to put sunscreen on.
*  It's actually the extract of a vine.
*  I did not cover that on the skin health
*  and appearance episode,
*  but we very soon have a guest, Dr. Tio Solomani,
*  who is an expert dermatologist oncologist
*  trained at Stanford and Harvard and UCLA,
*  who is going to talk about the use of essentially
*  sun guarding by the ingestion of certain compounds
*  that change the chemical composition of the skin
*  from the inside.
*  So that's very interesting.
*  He also added another tool for improving skin appearance
*  and this is true for the face and for the arms, et cetera,
*  is the use of laser resurfacing.
*  Now this is not a cosmetic procedure
*  as much as it is a procedure
*  to remove the very top epidermal layer,
*  the very, very superficial layer of dead keratinocytes
*  and other cells of the skin, excuse me,
*  as a means to reduce cancer risk.
*  Okay, so he's a derm oncologist.
*  It does have the consequence of making skin
*  look quite a bit younger.
*  So it does work.
*  And like anything in the realm of kind of laser resurfacing
*  and things of that sort,
*  it does require a period of peeling,
*  of staying out of sunlight
*  because and being really strict about that
*  because the skin is more sensitive in the immediate days
*  and even week after the laser resurfacing.
*  It was kind of remarkable for me to learn
*  that this laser resurfacing and the retinoids
*  are very well supported by dermatologists
*  as a preventative measure for certain forms,
*  not all forms, but certain forms of skin cancers
*  and that they can dramatically improve the appearance
*  of skin that is to make it look more youthful.
*  So certainly that would work on the arms as well.
*  So we've got, we're talking about collagen, red light,
*  retinoids, laser resurfacing by a qualified dermatologist
*  or derm oncologist ideally.
*  And the reason I emphasize the derm part
*  is there are a lot of people who do kind of plastic
*  and cosmetic work on skin who are probably very qualified.
*  And then there's probably some who are not as qualified
*  and there can be some real issues raised
*  by using excessive laser power and things of that sort.
*  This is something I also touched on in the episode.
*  So those are the four major ones.
*  And then of course, eating a diet that's low inflammatory.
*  So limiting fried and highly processed foods, of course,
*  making sure that you're getting enough
*  essential fatty acids in the form of either supplementing
*  or ingesting fatty fish, oils,
*  all of these sorts of things, fruits and vegetables, fiber,
*  all the sorts of things that support healthy skin internally,
*  some directly, some indirectly by virtue
*  of the gut microbiome.
*  So I think that's probably a sufficient answer.
*  I will add one last thing for your question, Robert.
*  It's very clear that the appearance of skin
*  is also very supported by hydration and moisture.
*  So applying a regular moisturizer,
*  a high quality moisturizer regularly,
*  pick a non-fragranced moisturizer regularly to the arms,
*  that will help as well.
*  And then there's some more aggressive approaches
*  that I'll talk about with Dr. Soleimani,
*  things like hyaluronic acid and things of that sort
*  that can help with the kind of plumpness
*  or moisture of the skin, but we'll hold off
*  for that episode, which comes out in a few weeks.
*  So thanks again for your question.
*  I like to think that those are some actionable tools.
*  And then depending on people's disposable income, time,
*  and energy they want to devote to this,
*  you could go with the zero cost one, the moderate cost one,
*  or the combination of all of them, if you're able to.
*  Okay, the next question comes from Jen Shaw.
*  How cold does the water need to be
*  for cold therapy to be effective?
*  This is a great question, especially since,
*  at least in the Northern hemisphere, it's summer
*  and people are doing cold plunges more, cold showers.
*  Such an effective tool for shifting the state of your mind.
*  You know, any debate about deliberate cold exposure to me
*  that centers around metabolism or, you know,
*  how long the dopamine increase lasts
*  is kind of a trivial one in my estimation,
*  because what do we know for sure?
*  We know that deliberate cold exposure is very, very low
*  cost or even cost saving if you use a cold shower,
*  because you're saving on the heating bill.
*  We know that if you can afford a cold plunge
*  or access a safe river or stream or cold plunge, great.
*  What do we know it does?
*  It changes your state, it shifts your state.
*  It makes you more alert, not just while you're in there,
*  but in the minutes and certainly up to an hour
*  or more afterwards.
*  And let's face it, rarely does it feel good getting in.
*  Sometimes it feels good being in it
*  because you're very, very warm before you get in it.
*  Maybe you came from a run or from the sauna,
*  but it always feels great getting out
*  and you always feel much better afterwards,
*  provided you get the right stimulus,
*  which is really what this question's about.
*  So what is the right stimulus?
*  How cold?
*  Cold enough that you feel a bit uncomfortable
*  and you want to get out, but you can safely stay in
*  and you stay in for a little bit longer.
*  Now, I know that sounds vague,
*  but there has never been a systematic study
*  of exactly how long to stay in at a given temperature
*  at a given time of day.
*  Why do I say at a given time of day?
*  Well, try doing a cold shower first thing in the morning.
*  It can be pretty rough, pretty jarring.
*  Try doing it at night when you're tired,
*  far bigger barrier to getting in that cold shower
*  or cold plunge, unless you are particularly warm
*  because you exited the sauna or exceptionally motivated.
*  So the point is to make the water just cold enough
*  that you would kind of retract from it,
*  that you don't want to be in it,
*  but not so that it's like a icy burn,
*  so cold that it burns.
*  This is my opinion.
*  I like to do deliberate cold exposure in the following way.
*  I don't even do it for time.
*  I do it for what I call walls.
*  So if you're having a hard time even persuading yourself
*  to get in the thing,
*  well, then that's one wall you need to get over.
*  And then if you get over that wall, which hopefully you do,
*  you get in and you start to breathe very quickly,
*  just know that if it's very cold, you'll breathe quickly.
*  And after about 20 seconds,
*  your ability to think clearly will come back online.
*  Okay, that's right about the time that most people say
*  that their hands or feet hurt.
*  Okay, I do recommend putting your hands under.
*  It's not necessary, but hands and feet under.
*  If you're in the shower,
*  getting your body as small as possible.
*  Sometimes people will huddle in the shower.
*  If you really want to make it uncomfortable,
*  you can raise your arms and get in your armpits,
*  which is especially cold.
*  But in any case, it should be uncomfortable.
*  And then you should stay in till you adapt to that.
*  I'm like, okay, so maybe that's 30 seconds.
*  Maybe it's 10 seconds, maybe it's a minute.
*  And then I suggest getting out at that point.
*  So I would say anywhere from one to three minutes
*  for most people, maybe 30 seconds.
*  If you're really experiencing a lot of mental barriers
*  to getting in there, and it should be just cold enough
*  that you don't want to be in there that you want to get out,
*  but that you can stay in for that one to three minutes safely.
*  Why do I say this?
*  Well, if you get into very, very cold water,
*  like 30 degree Fahrenheit water,
*  and you're and really hyperventilating,
*  you do run the risk of hypothermia.
*  You run the risk of putting your cardiovascular system
*  into shock.
*  I mean, there is a real danger to these things.
*  And by the way, you should never ever, ever
*  do any kind of breath work prior to getting
*  into deliberate cold, okay?
*  Prior to getting into very cold water.
*  Because if you're doing a lot of exhaling,
*  you're blowing off a lot of carbon dioxide
*  that will limit your gas reflex.
*  And there have been people who have done,
*  cyclic hyperventilation, deep breathing,
*  then gone into water,
*  and they didn't realize that they needed to breathe.
*  They didn't get that gas reflex early enough.
*  And unfortunately they blacked out and died.
*  So that's very serious.
*  So what do I recommend in terms of cold water?
*  Great to have somebody there.
*  Ideally you have somebody there with you,
*  who's not in the water with you,
*  who can monitor you.
*  If you're talking about cold shower or cold plunge,
*  and you're talking about,
*  okay, should I do it at 40 degrees
*  or 45 degrees Fahrenheit or 50 degrees?
*  Well, put your hand in and then ask yourself,
*  on a scale of one to 10,
*  how eager am I to get in?
*  If it's 10, well then it's probably a little too warm,
*  or maybe you're just highly motivated.
*  If it's a five or a six,
*  and you're kind of feeling some resistance,
*  great, provided it's not so cold that it's dangerous.
*  So for me, the typical temperature,
*  if you just want me to throw one out there,
*  is somewhere between 45 and 50 degrees.
*  And a few of my friends who really like it extra cold
*  or like an ice bath will say, oh, that's weak.
*  Well, that's what works for me.
*  I never liked the cold.
*  I love getting out of it.
*  Sometimes I like being in there after a little while,
*  but I never like getting into it.
*  I much prefer heat and the sauna.
*  And while we're here,
*  I'll just mention how hot for the sauna.
*  Again, same thing,
*  hot enough that you feel a little uncomfortable,
*  but not so hot that you put yourself in danger.
*  And here, we really have to emphasize danger
*  because it doesn't take much of a temperature increase
*  to overheat the brain.
*  So for me, I'm pretty heat tolerant.
*  So I'll put the traditional sauna, not infrared sauna,
*  but traditional sauna to about 210,
*  and I'll last about 10 to 20 minutes in there,
*  and then I'll go into the cold plunge and back and forth.
*  So if you're going to do the cold plunge for the first time,
*  maybe start at 55, 60 degrees and stay in a little longer.
*  If you're going to be more experienced with this
*  and you're more cold tolerant, try 45, 50.
*  And then if you're really aggressive
*  and you want to try getting down into the low 40s or so,
*  high 30s, well, then make sure you have somebody there
*  and make sure that you don't force yourself
*  to do something that's going to cause tissue damage
*  or cardiovascular damage.
*  Cold is a very potent stimulus
*  and you should go with the minimum effective dose,
*  but you don't have to obsess over the difference
*  between 58 degrees and 56 degrees or 46 and 48.
*  I think subjective feel is going to help.
*  Just make sure that you build in some safeties
*  so that you can adjust quickly, stay out of danger.
*  No deep breathing prior to getting in there.
*  Now, some of you might be asking,
*  well, what about deep breathing while I'm in there?
*  That's how I calm myself down.
*  That's fine, but no emphasizing the exhales
*  to blow off carbon dioxide.
*  Certainly no submerging yourself intentionally, okay?
*  So be safe, have fun with it, deliberate cold exposure,
*  I think is a wonderful tool for increasing alertness,
*  not just while you're in there, but when you get out.
*  In fact, that's the best part, if you ask me,
*  is getting out.
*  All right, next question is from Katie.
*  It's about self-motivation.
*  Do you have any suggestions or steps to self-motivate
*  to start a new routine?
*  I do, I do, I do, I do.
*  First of all, be very careful who you announce
*  and what you announce to people
*  in terms of starting a new routine,
*  unless they are going to really be on you
*  about accountability in general,
*  talking to people about our goals, less effective,
*  in my opinion, and then there's some research
*  to support this, then just simply making the decision,
*  writing it down, simple, you know, old school,
*  like me, 8 1 1⁄2 by 11 paper, write down what the goal is,
*  give yourself a check for each day that you do it
*  or the times of day that you do it.
*  Sometimes signing your signature
*  as if you have a contract with yourself can help.
*  These are all different tricks.
*  Some people will say, should you reward yourself
*  for completing something?
*  Sure, should you scare yourself into doing something?
*  Sure, there's data to support that also.
*  I covered this in the episode with Emily Balchettis
*  and about goal seeking and habits
*  that I did as solo episodes.
*  We have a newsletter on this.
*  Here's the deal.
*  There are going to be multiple barriers
*  to starting a new routine.
*  I do believe in incremental approaches to these things.
*  Right now I'm working on some bonus chapters of my book.
*  And while I'm a pretty motivated person,
*  I'm excited to share that information with the world.
*  I must say that setting aside time to do these bonus chapters
*  has been challenging because I've got a lot else going on.
*  So rather than tell people that I'm doing that,
*  I actually have a contract with myself
*  that I sign each time I complete anywhere
*  from a 10 to 60 minute writing block.
*  So a contract with yourself can really help.
*  I think it's far more valuable than stating to the world
*  what you're going to do.
*  I don't know why that tends to work,
*  but we know why stating to the world
*  what you're going to do often wears off
*  because typically, and this reflects both good and bad
*  things about human behavior and psychology,
*  typically people will support you by saying,
*  great, you're going to do great.
*  The book's going to be great.
*  Or your new exercise program is going to be great.
*  And they're just supporting you, supporting you,
*  supporting you.
*  And that support turns out to be sufficient
*  to create this mindset that you could do it at any point
*  where you've got the support you need.
*  Sometimes a little bit of additional friction,
*  what Tim Ferriss would call fear setting is a good idea.
*  You think about worst outcomes if you don't do the thing,
*  but let's face it, you can't lie to yourself and believe it.
*  So if you know that not doing the thing
*  isn't going to markedly change your life for the worse,
*  well, in that case, you need some additional support.
*  You need some additional motivation.
*  So you could use all sorts of tools and protocols
*  like a cold shower to increase epinephrine,
*  adrenaline and dopamine and get more motivated
*  than do something.
*  You could, and I think this is probably the best tool
*  anyone could apply, which would be to put away your phone,
*  turn it off, put it in the other room.
*  I now have a box for my phone that I've dedicated
*  to keeping my phone in when I'm busy doing
*  other types of work for which the presence of the phone
*  would be an intrusion.
*  It would limit my work output.
*  I do think that the contract with self
*  is going to be the best way.
*  You say, I am going to do 30 minutes of whatever,
*  resistance training three times a week,
*  and then you're going to sign off by the end of the week.
*  And when you complete each one,
*  that's your reward to yourself that you were accountable.
*  There's no external reward.
*  Why do I say this?
*  The work itself should become the reward.
*  We know this from all the work on growth mindset
*  that we've talked about.
*  Carol Dweck's wonderful work and David Yeager's wonderful work.
*  He was a guest on the podcast.
*  I've done solo episodes about their work
*  about growth mindset that ultimately the work
*  becoming the reward is how you're going to sustain
*  motivation over time.
*  So when you sign off that you did the work
*  and that's the reward,
*  well, then there's this kind of cyclical relationship
*  between what you've promised yourself you would do,
*  what you did and rewarding yourself for the work,
*  no additional external reward, the work becomes a reward.
*  So I like the idea of being a bit of a,
*  what we would call closed loop system on motivation
*  rather than going out and seeking excessive support
*  from others.
*  And I say this not to isolate,
*  I encourage healthy relationships.
*  But if we start seeking external validation or pressure
*  in order to do what we know we want to do
*  or would love to be able to do without external support,
*  we limit ourselves.
*  And when that support isn't there,
*  we tend to be far less productive
*  and move toward our goals far less well.
*  So it's an internal process of reshaping your psychology.
*  There's also some deeper psychology around this stuff
*  of agency and what you feel you deserve.
*  You deserve, I'll tell you this,
*  cause I believe everyone deserves to be able
*  to better themselves through these kinds
*  of self-directed actions.
*  And I also liked the idea of a closed loop
*  because you can be really honest with yourself
*  at the end of a week,
*  did you do your three sessions?
*  Did you sign off three times?
*  Keeping some of that reward system and validation internal
*  really helps you become stronger also
*  to be able to support other people
*  if they need your support.
*  Whereas if you have a committee of people that you rely on,
*  that you need to hear from,
*  you need their support in order to be motivated.
*  Well, that can be great.
*  Coaches can be great and support systems are wonderful.
*  I don't think it's nearly as effective
*  as being your own committee,
*  your own chair and secretary in this case,
*  and member of your own committee.
*  And then of course,
*  seek social support and reinforcement
*  for other areas of your life that you need
*  and be a source of social support,
*  but also encourage people to be in this kind of
*  self cyclical loop of motivation
*  and to really impart the principles of growth mindset,
*  which is really what we're talking about,
*  make the effort the reward.
*  Okay.
*  I'm gonna take a sip of tea here.
*  Lou asks,
*  what can you do if you're not getting enough
*  rapid eye movement sleep?
*  What are the consequences?
*  Okay, so to remind everybody,
*  rapid eye movement sleep is more enriched
*  towards the end of the night.
*  It differs from slow wave sleep or deep sleep.
*  It tends to be dream rich sleep.
*  The dreams tend to be more elaborate.
*  You also dream during deep sleep, during slow wave sleep,
*  but your dreams are far more emotionally laid in
*  during rapid eye movement sleep, more vivid, et cetera.
*  And rapid eye movement sleep is associated with learning.
*  So getting enough rapid eye movement sleep,
*  especially on the first night
*  after trying to learn something is important.
*  Rapid eye movement sleep is also important
*  for removing the emotional load of previous day
*  and previous days experiences.
*  So it's its own form of trauma therapy
*  during rapid eye movement sleep.
*  Your body is essentially incapable of releasing adrenaline.
*  So you can have these very intense emotional experiences
*  in your mind without adrenaline in your body.
*  You're actually paralyzed during rapid eye movement sleep.
*  It's a healthy paralysis sleep atonia it's called.
*  How do you get more REM sleep?
*  Well, one of the best ways to get more REM sleep
*  is to simply add anywhere from 10 minutes to 30 minutes
*  to your sleep schedule,
*  adding that 10 to 30 minutes in the morning.
*  Most people can't do that, however.
*  Another way to increase the amount
*  of rapid eye movement sleep that you get
*  is to get a bigger surge of epinephrine of adrenaline
*  in the early day prior to that sleep.
*  So this is a great reason to do deliberate cold exposure
*  in your shower in the morning.
*  You could also get it through exercise.
*  So exercising early in the morning,
*  and then we're talking about the rapid eye movement sleep
*  that occurs the very next, that same night.
*  Okay, so we're talking about a Monday morning
*  where you exercise and get deliberate cold exposure.
*  By the way, it is true that if you do
*  deliberate cold exposure after resistance training,
*  you can limit some of the strength
*  and hypertrophy increases or adaptations,
*  but at other times it seems to be fine.
*  And there is zero evidence that taking a cold shower
*  after resistance training is going to limit strength
*  or hypertrophy adaptation.
*  So you don't have to be too paranoid
*  about deliberate cold exposure.
*  In fact, I think the best recommendation I can make
*  about deliberate cold exposure is neither be too paranoid
*  nor too obsessive about it.
*  So spiking your adrenaline a bit
*  in the early part of the day with exercise
*  and or deliberate cold exposure
*  can help get more rapid eye movement sleep later that night.
*  Sleeping in a bit, even 10 minutes more going back to sleep.
*  This is a case for hitting the snooze.
*  You go back to sleep, maybe even two or three times.
*  Of course, better to just sleep the whole way through
*  until maximum long night is achieved,
*  long night of sleep that is.
*  If you wake up and you're not rested enough,
*  or if you're looking at your sleep score
*  and you don't see enough rapid eye movement sleep,
*  the other thing you can do is a non-sleep deep rest protocol,
*  which by the way, Matt Walker's laboratory and I
*  are gearing up to do some studies on non-sleep deep rest
*  and how it impacts the brain specifically as opposed,
*  and this has been done in other studies,
*  but not with modern methods in a while.
*  So we're excited about that.
*  So do a 10 to 30 minute or 10 or 20 minute
*  non-sleep deep rest protocol.
*  Those are easy to find.
*  I have zero cost ones that are on YouTube.
*  You simply put NSDR Huberman.
*  There's a 10 minute one, a 20 minute one.
*  We have them in Spotify format.
*  There's actually a link on the Hubermanlab.com webpage
*  that links out to audio format
*  so that you don't have to go onto YouTube
*  if you don't want to do that.
*  You can download that script from Spotify
*  and that way you have it in your phone.
*  You don't need to even have internet access.
*  So if you're camping or you're out of internet access,
*  you can still do that non-sleep deep rest.
*  And then if you prefer a female voice, Kelly Boyz, B-O-Y-S,
*  has some wonderful NSDR and yoga nidra scripts on YouTube
*  and has her own, she also is on the waking up app
*  doing NSDR and yoga nidra.
*  So I would do that first thing in the morning
*  to get a bit more REM-like rest is what we'll call it
*  until the data are in.
*  REM-like rest puts the brain into this very interesting
*  state with body completely still, right?
*  Similar to sleep atonia that you observe in REM sleep
*  and mind active, very similar to REM sleep.
*  This is actually our hypothesis,
*  which is that non-sleep deep rest
*  mimics rapid eye movement sleep,
*  but that hypothesis still needs to be tested formally
*  and Dr. Walker and I are going to do that.
*  So that's another way to get more REM sleep.
*  The other way, and this is kind of a tongue in cheek answer
*  is if you don't get enough REM sleep on one night,
*  you can be sure that if you allow yourself sufficient sleep
*  the next night, you'll get more REM sleep
*  than you normally would anyway,
*  had you slept well the previous night.
*  What does all that mean?
*  Means that there's something called the REM sleep rebound.
*  If you don't sleep enough
*  or you don't get enough REM sleep on say Monday night,
*  Tuesday night when you go to sleep,
*  provided you didn't blitz your system with caffeine,
*  you're not ingesting anything
*  that would disrupt your REM sleep
*  such as caffeine late in the day, well, or alcohol,
*  which will disrupt REM sleep dramatically.
*  Well, then you will get more REM sleep on Tuesday night.
*  Okay, there's a rem compensation.
*  Anyone that's tracked their sleep has observed this.
*  So that's another way.
*  Right now, there's no clear pharmacology
*  to induce more REM sleep, unfortunately.
*  There are some tools to increase slow wave sleep,
*  deep sleep pharmacologically.
*  Some of the growth hormones,
*  the creatagogues that are in common peptides will do that.
*  But right now there doesn't seem to be any pharmacology
*  directed specifically at increasing REM sleep.
*  There are a few, these go by brand names like Quivivic
*  and things like that that are thought to do this,
*  but it's still somewhat debated
*  as to whether or not they specifically increase REM sleep.
*  Okay, Danielle says,
*  the top three most impactful things schools could do
*  to raise student capacity for learning.
*  What a great question.
*  Well, I'll add a fourth because I don't want to,
*  I don't want to try and wriggle out of the question
*  by just saying sleep again.
*  But I think trying to get kids to sleep enough
*  is going to be key.
*  So that means off phones and iPads
*  in the middle of the night.
*  That means starting school a little bit later.
*  I don't know if that's ever going to work,
*  but that would be a marvelous thing for learning
*  because as you know, or we all should know,
*  or remember neuroplasticity and learning is triggered
*  by focused attention,
*  which is supported by having slept well the night before,
*  but the actual rewiring of neural connections occurs
*  when it occurs during sleep.
*  It occurs during deep sleep and rapid eye movement sleep.
*  That's when the reorganization of neural connections occurs,
*  the strengthening of particular synapses,
*  the weakening of other synapses.
*  And there's a small, small, small,
*  perhaps infinitesimally small percentage of neuroplasticity
*  that is the consequence of the addition of new neurons.
*  So most neuroplasticity is not that,
*  most neuroplasticity is the reorganization
*  of existing neural connections.
*  But nonetheless, that happens during sleep.
*  So getting kids to sleep enough, nap enough,
*  sleep late if they need to is actually a great thing,
*  but who knows if schools will change their protocols.
*  What else can we do?
*  What can schools do?
*  Well, I'm a big fan, as you know,
*  of non-sleep deep rest.
*  Wouldn't it be wonderful if in every school
*  that started the day with a five minute meditation
*  or non-sleep deep rest,
*  where kids would do some quiet, focused breathing,
*  bringing their attention back to their breathing,
*  bringing their attention back to the spot
*  just behind their forehead,
*  just before beginning a learning session.
*  Why? Why?
*  Is it about mysticism? No.
*  Is it about trying to understand consciousness? No.
*  It's about a study done by Wendy Suzuki's laboratory
*  at New York University.
*  She's their current Dean of Letters and Science
*  as far as I know.
*  She's a neuroscientist.
*  She has a spectacular record
*  in the field of neuroscience and psychology.
*  And her laboratory showed
*  that even a very brief meditation session
*  in that particular study,
*  it was about 13 minutes per day,
*  can significantly improve working memory,
*  which is the ability to keep information online
*  in one's mind active.
*  It can increase other forms of memory.
*  It can increase focus.
*  It can decrease stress.
*  And it is a zero cost tool.
*  So I think, unfortunately,
*  we think of meditation as a mystical tool
*  to explore consciousness.
*  And it can be, but if you think about it,
*  exercise can also be an ultra marathon
*  to run 242 miles or something to win a trophy,
*  or it can be something to improve cardiovascular health.
*  So similarly, meditation is just a perceptual exercise.
*  I think that if kids learn
*  that they can bring their perception internally
*  to what we call interoception,
*  as opposed to looking at things externally,
*  exteroception, understand that they have some control,
*  some regulation over their focus and attention,
*  bringing their attention back to them,
*  to interoception whenever it drifts,
*  well, then they get better at focus over time
*  and it improves learning in the long-term,
*  but also in the bout of learning
*  that they go into immediately after.
*  So, if I had a magic wand,
*  every classroom would begin a session of learning
*  with five minutes or maybe even three minutes
*  of what is typically known as third eye
*  or focused meditation with no interest in mysticism,
*  pure interest in improving the bout of learning.
*  I think another thing that schools should include
*  to increase capacity for learning
*  is they should include micro gaps.
*  So, we know that if you take gaps in information delivery,
*  so for instance, if I were to just pause now
*  and then continue,
*  so it seems like kind of an odd interruption,
*  and then every once in a while at random,
*  introduce a short 10 second pause or so,
*  what do we know happens?
*  We know based on now a number of different
*  really high quality papers
*  how they'd have looked at musical learning,
*  mathematical learning, concept learning,
*  physical skill learning,
*  that those little micro gaps
*  allow for very rapid replay of the information
*  that's relevant for whatever reason in reverse
*  in the brain very quickly within the hippocampus
*  and the neocortex areas of the brain,
*  critical for encoding and storage of memories.
*  And these little micro gaps
*  and the rapid replay of the information one is trying
*  to learn at 20 to 30 times the normal rate
*  increases the number of repetitions.
*  You're basically getting 30 repetitions for doing nothing.
*  This is exactly what happens in what?
*  In rapid eye movement sleep.
*  When you learn something,
*  like maybe you learned something today
*  in our discussion thus far,
*  and you go to sleep at night,
*  there's a very strong chance
*  that if we were to record from your brain,
*  we would see that the same areas of your brain
*  that were active during specific portions
*  of this discussion,
*  which arguably is more of a lecture than a discussion,
*  but those brain areas would repeat
*  at 20 to 30 times speed within a very compressed time.
*  And then you'd go back to a different pattern
*  of brain activity.
*  What is going on?
*  Well, in rapid eye movement sleep,
*  the brain is rehearsing.
*  It's generating repetitions of certain forms of behavior
*  and certain forms of learning of cognitive information.
*  At high speed, you're generating more repetitions.
*  And this is critical for the learning process.
*  We know this from animal studies.
*  We now know this from human studies as well.
*  So if in the classroom teachers would just say,
*  okay, we just finished discussing,
*  I don't know, the cell cycle or the Krebs cycle.
*  Now let's take a moment.
*  And students are not checking their phone at that time
*  or reviewing the material at that time.
*  They just got 20 to 30 repetitions of,
*  and by the way, at a subconscious level,
*  they're not aware of it,
*  of the material they had just been exposed to.
*  And so you introduce these, excuse me, at random.
*  You could do anywhere from one to five of these per hour.
*  You could do as many as 10 per hour.
*  You're just introducing these brief micro rest intervals.
*  There's a beautiful literature to support this.
*  And the third thing, it's very important,
*  is I think it's very, very clear that physical activity,
*  in particular cardiovascular training,
*  any kind of physical activity, running, jogging, swimming,
*  et cetera, is going to facilitate learning,
*  especially if the learning is done
*  immediately after that activity.
*  That's right, if the learning is done
*  immediately after that activity.
*  And that's probably related to the increase
*  in the various catecholamines,
*  dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine
*  associated with physical activity,
*  then making coding of new memories
*  and coding of new information more readily accessible.
*  So this is a call for including PE class
*  or even just some basic movement,
*  even walks or things of that sort.
*  We can look at this through the other lens
*  and say, what are the worst things for learning?
*  Terrible sleep, being delivered information
*  like through a fire hose with no pauses.
*  And forgive me if from time to time I tend to do that.
*  Maybe I should start introducing micro gaps
*  into the podcast, but you can always just pause it.
*  Go back to it, I feel like real life provides that.
*  There is the strong, strong incentive
*  for including some physical movement each day.
*  And then I suppose if we were going to include another one,
*  we'd say that kids and teachers should have a discussion
*  about optimal learning protocols.
*  They should understand where their thresholds are
*  after which their attention falls off.
*  There's really no point in trying to learn information
*  if you're not focused on what you're trying to learn.
*  And then there's a whole discussion to be had about caffeine.
*  There's a whole discussion to be had about nutrition
*  as it relates to maintaining alertness throughout the day.
*  Anyone that's ever gone into a lecture on a college campus
*  or a high school or elementary school, even after lunch,
*  you'll see that people's brains are just kind of idling
*  there in the background.
*  It's the rare student that's wrapped with attention
*  even after a big lunch, even after running around outside.
*  So structuring of the day properly is essential.
*  And of course, get that sleep at night.
*  Okay, Alec, could you share your thoughts
*  on how Shilaji might influence cognitive function
*  and physical health, specifically its impact
*  to boost testosterone?
*  I get a lot of questions about Shilaji.
*  Shilaji is a mineral pitch from the Himalayas.
*  There are a lot of fake versions out there,
*  but the authentic versions are basically,
*  this is stuff that basically they take soil and grasses
*  and a bunch of things and they mash it down
*  and they take the extract
*  and they create this stuff called Shilaji,
*  which sometimes is sold as a thick paste,
*  kind of a tar-like paste.
*  Sometimes it's in capsules.
*  What do we know about Shilaji?
*  Shilaji contains minerals that are thought to augment
*  some hormone pathways.
*  And that's why people have argued
*  and it's marketed that Shilaji increases vitality.
*  It's been argued that Shilaji can increase testosterone,
*  maybe estrogen as well.
*  There are actually a few studies on this
*  that are covered at examine.com.
*  I'm going to bring up one just now.
*  This we can induce a little gap effect here
*  if there's a pause.
*  There is some data, not a ton,
*  but there's some data that support the use of Shilaji
*  for testosterone increase,
*  but I would place it on the low end
*  of the effectiveness scale in terms of things
*  to increase testosterone.
*  And then of course, the real question is,
*  are you getting enough authentic Shilaji
*  to really have an effect?
*  The dosaging on this is very mysterious.
*  In other words, I personally wouldn't place Shilaji high
*  on any list of ways to generate hormone support.
*  There are far better ways.
*  I mean, the best ways of course are to make sure
*  that your body fat percentage is neither too high
*  nor too low, okay?
*  The people who are overweight, who are obese,
*  who lose body fat will improve
*  their hormone profiles dramatically.
*  However, people who are already very lean,
*  who get excessively lean,
*  you can disrupt testosterone levels dramatically.
*  And by the way, anytime there's a discussion
*  about testosterone, I want to remind
*  that both men and women have testosterone.
*  It's important in both men and women.
*  Yes, it's related to libido,
*  but having sufficiently high levels of estrogen
*  in both men and women is also critical for libido.
*  People that take drugs like an Astrazole
*  to disrupt the aromatase conversion of testosterone
*  into estrogen can sometimes find themselves
*  with reduced libido.
*  And that's because estrogen is critical for libido
*  in men and women as is testosterone.
*  So it's all about the ratios.
*  Going back to Shilaji,
*  let's look at the human effect matrix on Shilaji.
*  There is one study here with 60 participants
*  that cites a small increase,
*  small but statistically significant increase
*  in follicle stimulating hormone, FSH,
*  which in females is critical, in males is critical.
*  And the extent of the increase is just very small.
*  So it's not clear that it would be worth taking Shilaji
*  given the risks and the cost.
*  It depends on how aggressive you are
*  in trying to increase testosterone.
*  Certainly there are other ways.
*  Sperm quality, one study showing a small improvement
*  in sperm quality.
*  One study of 60 participants showing a small increase
*  in testosterone.
*  And then of course, there's a bunch of other things
*  that have been looked at.
*  The perhaps most impressive effect is a reduction
*  in some LDLs.
*  But again, even though I say the most impressive,
*  it's still a small effect.
*  So I wouldn't place Shilaji high on the list
*  of supplements to consider.
*  Always, always, always before talking about supplements,
*  you want to get your nutrition right.
*  I've talked about how to do this.
*  You want to be exercising, but not over training.
*  You want to do both resistance training
*  and cardiovascular training, maybe on the same day
*  or different days, whatever your schedule allows.
*  You want to make sure you get enough sleep at night.
*  If you want to increase your testosterone significantly,
*  get an extra 30 to 60 minutes of sleep each night.
*  Even a 20 minute increase in rapid eye movement sleep
*  is going to serve your testosterone far better
*  than taking Shilaji.
*  Will taking Shilaji increase your vitality?
*  You know, probably increase your energy a bit.
*  You might increase libido a bit.
*  You have to ask yourself, is it transient?
*  Is that effect transient?
*  Is it directly related to testosterone increases?
*  Probably not.
*  It's probably directly related
*  to follicle stimulating hormone increases.
*  And for women who have a menstrual cycle that is, you know,
*  obviously going to lead to different constellations
*  of hormones, markedly different constellations of hormones,
*  such as follicle stimulating hormone, estrogen,
*  progestins, et cetera, different times throughout the cycle.
*  Taking something like Shilaji
*  because it can stimulate FSH release
*  can potentially disrupt that.
*  If you're a male who's doing everything else,
*  like you're exercising, you're sleeping well,
*  your nutrition is locked in.
*  You are taking creatine and fish oil.
*  You're taking care of your gut microbiome
*  and you want to experiment with Shilaji.
*  Well, by all means, find a reliable source of Shilaji.
*  They are out there.
*  Just look for one that has some testing for authenticity.
*  And then you're likely to be able to see
*  within about a week or so
*  if it leads to a significant increase in vitality,
*  libido, whatever it is that you're seeking.
*  But I wouldn't play Shilaji high
*  on the list of things to pursue.
*  And I will also say having tried Shilaji,
*  it's pretty messy.
*  It's hard to get the dosaging right in the tar form.
*  The capsules make it a little bit easier.
*  If you wanted to explore other ways to augment testosterone
*  that have a bit more data to support them,
*  I would say things like Tonga-Ali,
*  which may have its effects on increasing libido
*  in both men and women by virtue of increasing testosterone
*  or maybe free testosterone.
*  More likely, it's an increase in luteinizing hormone
*  in that case, which is upstream of testosterone.
*  So this can all get into some pretty extended discussions
*  about biochemical pathways and hormone pathways.
*  I did this on the episode
*  about optimizing testosterone and estrogen
*  as a solo episode that I also covered
*  with Dr. Kyle Gillette and with Dr. Peter Attia.
*  By the way, if you go to hubermanlab.com
*  and you put in any combination of search items,
*  if you put, for instance, Shilaji testosterone,
*  it will take you to the timestamp that covers that.
*  If you put Tonga-Ali testosterone or libido,
*  Tonga-Ali will take you to the timestamps
*  across different episodes, directly to those timestamps
*  so that you don't have to listen to entire episodes
*  or go searching for this information.
*  It's all there.
*  We also have an AI engine at hubermanlab.com
*  that allows you to do searches on this sort of thing.
*  But of course, I'm happy to talk to you about it as well.
*  I'm delighted to.
*  So again, if you have the budget
*  and you're somebody who likes to experiment,
*  maybe Shilaji is the right thing for you.
*  Find a good brand.
*  It shouldn't be hard to distinguish the real brands.
*  They always have a label of authentication on there.
*  And if you're going to already be doing
*  everything else right behaviorally
*  and you want to explore supplementation
*  for improving testosterone, vitality, et cetera,
*  then I would say don't start with Shilaji.
*  You'd probably be best off starting with something
*  like Tonga-Ali, maybe Fadojia.
*  I've talked about these things previously.
*  Okay.
*  Let's see.
*  Two questions popped up in front of me.
*  So I'll just take the first one.
*  Alexander.
*  I like the way you spell your name, Alexander.
*  It's unusual.
*  I dig it.
*  What has your process been for the writing of your book?
*  Slow.
*  I have a saying that I say in my lab
*  or that I have said for many years in doing science
*  when I was a graduate student of postdoc and then in my lab.
*  And by the way, because sometimes people ask about this,
*  I still have research funds for human studies.
*  I closed my animal lab, focusing mainly on teaching,
*  which I'll be doing again this year.
*  I'm teaching in the spring,
*  maybe in the winter as well to undergraduates.
*  And I may get re-involved
*  in some human clinical studies on vision,
*  an area that I've loved for many years.
*  But in any case, there's a saying
*  that I always would reiterate to my students in postdocs,
*  which is I go as fast as I carefully can.
*  Okay.
*  So I believe in a sense of urgency.
*  I like to sit down to write and think, okay,
*  I'm going to go as fast as I carefully can.
*  It's that right balance between urgency and precision.
*  Okay.
*  Going fast is rarely good in its own right.
*  Going too slow isn't good either.
*  So there's that place where I feel like
*  I'm just pushing myself a little bit,
*  but then you have to be careful, right?
*  So as fast as you carefully can.
*  So the process has been slow,
*  but I've been going as fast as I carefully can.
*  Any recommendations on overcoming obstacles
*  and how did you deal with them?
*  Yes, put that phone away, put it in the other room.
*  If you have to generate accountability measures, do it.
*  When I used to write grants in my laboratory in San Diego,
*  you can ask my lab.
*  I used to walk in and say,
*  okay, I'm giving my phone to somebody.
*  And if I ask for it back before 5 p.m. today,
*  you each get a thousand dollars.
*  And I did not have a thousand dollars
*  to give everyone in my lab.
*  I had a pretty big lab and I didn't have the money.
*  So you may have to create some barriers
*  and gosh, about an hour and a half in,
*  I'd think, okay, gosh,
*  I was supposed to respond to this person today.
*  They're going to think that I've dropped off the map.
*  Oh my goodness.
*  And then I'd remember, I have an office phone.
*  Someone really need to get a hold of me
*  if it was an emergency, they'd let me know.
*  And if I couldn't be reached that way, someone would find me.
*  I realized for people with kids, et cetera,
*  this might not be feasible.
*  But if you have to do that, you do that.
*  Set stakes, okay?
*  Give someone a check for an exorbitant amount of money
*  that you can't afford to give away,
*  but that you do have in your bank account,
*  give them that check and say,
*  if I don't stop writing for the next hour,
*  then you can tear up the check.
*  Otherwise you can go cash it.
*  So you can put some fear in there,
*  but again, as I mentioned earlier,
*  better to generate these kind of incentives with yourself.
*  So I like to put my phone away.
*  I like to take about 10 minutes
*  to transition into the writing.
*  And then I actually set rules for myself.
*  I don't allow myself to get out of the seat,
*  even to use the bathroom.
*  It's true.
*  I've never gone to the bathroom in my seat,
*  but I resist the temptation to get up
*  until the timer goes off.
*  That's how I did it as an undergraduate.
*  That's how I did it writing grants.
*  That's how I've done it writing fellowships
*  as a graduate student.
*  And that's how I write the book now.
*  And I find that after about 20, 30 minutes,
*  I don't want to stand up.
*  I'm super happy.
*  And then if an interruption comes,
*  then I get frustrated because I want to keep writing.
*  So give it a try.
*  Set some high stakes incentives for yourself.
*  I mean, don't make them too high,
*  but set some high stakes incentive.
*  Thank you for saying looking forward to the book.
*  I appreciate it.
*  If you want to buy a pre-order copy,
*  it's a protocolsbook.com.
*  It's there in multiple languages now.
*  I'd be grateful if you did.
*  On the other hand, if you don't want to buy it
*  or you just want to wait till it comes out,
*  that's fine too.
*  And I'm just grateful that I have the opportunity
*  to put this information into one place
*  that people can access if they like.
*  Mike Torres.
*  And I think this is the last question, right?
*  Are we down to about the last question?
*  Two more, one more?
*  All right, here we go.
*  I'm asking my producer here.
*  Mike, where can I find information from Huberman Lab
*  regarding addictions and recovery?
*  Great question.
*  I get this a lot.
*  A lot of people struggle with addiction.
*  Addiction is a progressive narrowing
*  of the things that bring you pleasure
*  in ways that can be very disruptive for your life.
*  These can be process addictions,
*  meaning behavioral addictions.
*  These can be substance abuse issues.
*  First of all, I just want to say,
*  while I have no formal relationship to them,
*  there are wonderful zero cost resources
*  in every city around the world,
*  12 step communities, go online, look for that.
*  The meetings and programs that they provide are very useful,
*  have proven very useful.
*  Actually, this was explored in a study
*  from Stanford Psychiatry a few years ago
*  because there hadn't been a lot of science
*  on those sorts of programs.
*  And the conclusion was they can be very, very useful.
*  In terms of Huberman Lab resources,
*  if you go to HubermanLab.com,
*  put addiction into the search function,
*  it will take you to specific timestamps,
*  mainly of an episode that I did with Dr. Anna Lemke,
*  who is our director of the Dual Diagnosis Addiction Clinic
*  at Stanford, the author of Dopamine Nation,
*  an absolute virtuoso in terms of the description
*  of the underlying biological mechanisms,
*  mostly surrounding dopamine,
*  but also the approach to treating
*  and getting over addictions.
*  You can get over addictions.
*  People get sober from their addictions.
*  It takes time, it takes energy, it takes effort.
*  And in every case, it's an incredibly rewarding thing
*  that just makes your life and other people's lives better.
*  So I highly encourage anyone that's struggling
*  with process addictions or substance abuse addictions
*  or alcohol use disorder or things of that sort
*  to pursue those resources, both on our website
*  and of course, the other resources
*  that I mentioned a few minutes ago.
*  Also Anna's book, Dopamine Nation, is a wonderful one.
*  It will allow you to see and understand
*  that these are brain mechanisms that are at play.
*  These are not, it's not a lack of willpower.
*  It's a disruption in neurochemical circuit regulation.
*  And that should give you some grace
*  and some feelings of ease,
*  because what that means is that while it is not
*  quote unquote your fault,
*  it is your responsibility to deal with it.
*  And you can, and there are great zero cost resources
*  to do that.
*  So please access those.
*  And then just popped up on my screen, it says,
*  happy birthday, Karen Dhingar.
*  I hope I pronounced that correctly.
*  Happy birthday, Karen.
*  And happy birthday to anyone else
*  whose birthday happens to be today
*  or in the vicinity of today.
*  I guess this is going to be recorded
*  and put out eventually,
*  and then it'll be somebody's birthday on every day
*  at some point.
*  But happy birthday, Karen.
*  Thank you for being a premium subscriber.
*  Thank you all for tuning in.
*  Thank you to those of you that listened to this
*  at a later time recorded.
*  I really appreciate your questions.
*  I really appreciate your support of Huberman Lab.
*  As I've said many times before, it's a labor of love.
*  It continues to be a labor of love.
*  I spend my life,
*  basically all of my waking life minus some self care
*  and some care of others.
*  And hopefully I have a bulldog soon,
*  another bulldog soon.
*  Can't wait.
*  I've been looking for bulldogs
*  and there will be another one soon.
*  I don't know his or her name will be.
*  But in the absence of tending to those things,
*  I'm focusing 98% of my waking life
*  to trying to suss out the best health
*  and science information for you all
*  and get it out to you in formats
*  that are convenient for you, that are useful for you
*  and that you can apply.
*  Also discussions with expert guests.
*  So there are the guest episodes, the solo episodes.
*  There's hubermanlab.com has a lot of resources
*  like the AI engine.
*  Please give that a try if you like.
*  It's basically an AI version of me,
*  which is kind of weird to me,
*  but it does a pretty good job.
*  I would say it does a very good job
*  of encapsulating a lot of themes.
*  It's a great way to generate your own brief protocols
*  if you want to do that.
*  You can ask it to generate a exercise plan
*  based on hubermanlab protocols or what have you.
*  And then the newsletters,
*  I'm assuming most of you already subscribe to,
*  but if you would be so kind as to make sure
*  that you follow the podcast by clicking subscribe
*  on YouTube, following the podcast on Apple and Spotify,
*  just click, if you already follow by the way,
*  make sure you don't accidentally unfollow.
*  But if you go click that follow tab, that really helps us.
*  It's zero cost.
*  Give us a five-star review if you think we deserve it
*  or different review if you think we deserve that.
*  I love your comments on YouTube.
*  I do read them all.
*  I really do read them all.
*  Even go and find the hidden comments that get filtered
*  and I read those too.
*  So please, if you feel inclined,
*  you can support us in that way.
*  And most importantly, take the protocols
*  and the information that you think works for you,
*  apply it, discard the protocols and the information
*  that you don't feel is for you, discard it.
*  That's great.
*  And of course, I don't deserve credit
*  for any of these protocols per se, right?
*  These are the product of so much great science
*  and health studies out there, clinical studies.
*  And I'm just a funnel in a filter,
*  but it is a true pleasure to be able
*  to be that funnel and filter.
*  So thank you for letting me funnel and filter
*  today's knowledge for you.
*  And as always, thank you for your interest in science.
