# Dr. Matt Walker: Using Sleep to Improve Learning, Creativity & Memory | Huberman Lab Guest Series
**Andrew Huberman:** [April 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9KrZd_-ge0)
*  Welcome to the Huberman Lab guest series,
*  where I and an expert guest discuss science
*  and science-based tools for everyday life.
*  I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology
*  and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.
*  Today's episode marks the fourth
*  in our six episode series, All About Sleep,
*  with expert guest, Dr. Matthew Walker.
*  During today's episode, we discuss sleep and learning,
*  as well as the impact of sleep
*  and the specific stages of sleep on creativity and memory.
*  We talk about when and how long to sleep,
*  relative to different bouts of learning,
*  as well as the role of naps in consolidating information
*  that you are trying to learn.
*  We discuss the science and protocols of sleep,
*  as it relates to both cognitive learning and motor learning,
*  and the mechanism by which sleep encodes memories.
*  As with the previous episodes in this series,
*  today's episode includes information
*  about the biology of sleep, as well as practical tools,
*  that is, protocols, in which you can use sleep
*  to improve your learning, memory, and creativity.
*  Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize
*  that this podcast is separate from my teaching
*  and research roles at Stanford.
*  It is, however, part of my desire and effort
*  to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
*  and science-related tools to the general public.
*  In keeping with that theme,
*  I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
*  Our first sponsor is Helix Sleep.
*  Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows
*  that are customized to your unique sleep needs.
*  It's abundantly clear that sleep is the foundation
*  of mental health, physical health, and performance.
*  When we're getting enough quality sleep,
*  everything in life goes so much better,
*  and when we are not getting enough quality sleep,
*  everything in life is that much more challenging.
*  And one of the key things to getting a great night's sleep
*  is to have the appropriate mattress.
*  Everyone, however, has slightly different needs
*  in terms of what would be the optimal mattress for them.
*  Helix understands that people have unique sleep needs,
*  and they've designed a brief two-minute quiz
*  that asks you questions like, do you sleep on your back,
*  your side, or your stomach?
*  Do you tend to run hot or cold during the night?
*  Or maybe you don't know the answers to those questions.
*  If you go to the Helix site and take that brief quiz,
*  they'll match you to a mattress that's optimal for you.
*  For me, it turned out to be the Dusk, D-U-S-K, mattress.
*  It's not too hard, not too soft,
*  and I sleep so much better on my Helix mattress
*  than on any other type of mattress I've used before.
*  So if you're interested in upgrading your mattress,
*  go to helixsleep.com slash Huberman,
*  take their brief two-minute sleep quiz,
*  and they'll match you to a customized mattress for you,
*  and you'll get up to $350 off any mattress order
*  and two free pillows.
*  Again, that's helixsleep.com slash Huberman
*  to save up to $350 off and two free pillows.
*  Today's episode is also brought to us by Whoop.
*  Whoop is a fitness wearable device
*  that tracks your daily activity and sleep,
*  but also goes beyond that by providing real-time feedback
*  on how to adjust your training and sleep schedule
*  to perform better.
*  I've been working with Whoop
*  on their scientific advisory council
*  to try and help advance Whoop's mission
*  of unlocking human performance.
*  As a Whoop user, I've experienced the health benefits
*  of their technology firsthand for sleep tracking,
*  for monitoring other features of my physiology,
*  and for giving me a lot of feedback
*  about metrics within my brain and body
*  that tell me how hard I should train or not train,
*  and basically point to the things that I'm doing correctly
*  and incorrectly in my daily life
*  that I can adjust using protocols,
*  some of which are actually within the Whoop app.
*  Given that many of us have goals such as improving our sleep,
*  building better habits,
*  or just focusing more on our overall health,
*  Whoop is one of the tools
*  that can really help you get personalized data,
*  recommendations, and coaching toward your overall health.
*  In addition to being one of the most accurate sleep trackers
*  in the world, Whoop allows you to recover more quickly
*  and fully from physical exercise and other kinds of stress,
*  and thereby to train more effectively and sleep better.
*  If you're interested in trying Whoop,
*  you can go to join.whoop.com slash Huberman today
*  to get your first month free.
*  Again, that's join.whoop.com slash Huberman.
*  Today's episode is also brought to us by Waking Up.
*  The Waking Up app is a meditation app
*  that offers hundreds of guided meditations,
*  mindfulness trainings, yoga nidra sessions, and more.
*  I started meditating over 30 years ago.
*  At that time, there wasn't very much science on meditation,
*  but by now, we know that there's a lot of strong science
*  supporting the fact that a daily meditation practice
*  can improve mood, focus, and alertness,
*  and can reduce stress and improve sleep and overall health.
*  One thing that I and many others have noticed
*  is that while meditation is excellent for buffering stress,
*  it's oftentimes during periods of stress
*  that we let our meditation practice go.
*  The Waking Up app overcomes this
*  by offering meditations of different durations,
*  so they have some longer ones of 30 to 60 minutes,
*  but also some much briefer ones, 10, five,
*  and even one minute meditations
*  that are known to be effective.
*  So no matter how busy or stressed you get,
*  you always make time for your meditation practice.
*  The fact that they have lots of different types
*  of meditations and yoga nidra sessions
*  and non-sleep deep rest protocols
*  also make sure that your meditations
*  are kept fresh and interesting.
*  You never get bored of them.
*  I personally use the Waking Up app
*  to do a five to 10 minute meditation
*  or a non-sleep deep rest protocol,
*  which is similar to yoga nidra each and every day.
*  And if I miss a day, I try and double up the amount of time
*  that I do NSDR, yoga nidra, or meditation the following day.
*  Yoga nidra and non-sleep deep rest protocols
*  can be done essentially any time of day
*  in order to restore mental and physical vigor.
*  I'll sometimes do one first thing in the morning
*  if I wake up and I feel I didn't get
*  quite enough sleep the previous night.
*  You can also do yoga nidra or NSDR
*  in the middle of the night.
*  If you wake up and you're having trouble falling back asleep,
*  sometimes they will allow you to fall back asleep.
*  And if they don't, you'll still feel more refreshed
*  than you would have had you been tossing and turning
*  and worrying about not getting sleep.
*  So NSDR and yoga nidra are terrific
*  for both restoring mental and physical vigor
*  and potentially for restoring sleep
*  that you otherwise would have missed.
*  If you'd like to try the Waking Up app,
*  you can go to wakingup.com slash Huberman
*  to get a free 30 day trial.
*  Again, that's wakingup.com slash Huberman.
*  And now for my conversation with Dr. Matthew Walker.
*  Dr. Walker.
*  Dr. Huberman.
*  Welcome back.
*  We have covered a lot of material.
*  First episode of this series,
*  you gave us an overview of sleep
*  and some actionable items about sleep.
*  Then in the second episode,
*  you gave us far more actionable items
*  of how to think about one's sleep
*  in a way that leads to very concrete decisions
*  about controlling light, temperature, when to sleep,
*  and then some really in-depth advanced tools
*  or protocols as we call them.
*  And then in the third episode,
*  we talked about caffeine and napping
*  and some other things that people can do
*  to really supercharge their alertness
*  through sleep augmentation in the daytime.
*  And today we're going to talk about sleep,
*  learning and memory,
*  and a topic that I know everybody
*  is very interested in, creativity.
*  Indeed.
*  For a splendid pleasure to be back on the show.
*  Thank you for having me.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  So I think nowadays most people understand
*  that there's some relationship between sleep and learning,
*  but I think it would still be a good idea
*  for us to zoom out a bit
*  and establish what that relationship is.
*  You know, I think most people are familiar
*  with being exposed to some new material,
*  cognitive material, physical skill material,
*  and not being able to learn it right away,
*  but then having a few days in between,
*  and then all of a sudden, voila.
*  The skill has been embedded, it seems.
*  But not obvious in that scenario is that sleep
*  is perhaps the pivotal event
*  that allowed the learning process to take place.
*  So how do you think about sleep
*  as it relates to learning and memory?
*  I think I've conceptualized it in three different stages
*  or three different buckets of a benefit.
*  The first is that we need sleep before learning
*  to prepare your brain to initially imprint
*  and lay those memory traces down.
*  But then you need to sleep after learning
*  to take those sort of freshly minted memories
*  and then save them and cement them into the brain
*  so that you don't lose them.
*  The third domain is that sleep will then take
*  those new memories that you've been learning,
*  and it will start to collide them
*  with all of this back catalog of information
*  that you've already got stored in your brain.
*  And it updates the iOS of your informational systems
*  so that then you come back the next day
*  and you have a better abled ability
*  to understand how the world works.
*  In other words, the difference between knowledge,
*  which is learning the facts, and wisdom,
*  which is knowing what it all means when you put it together,
*  that's the third category.
*  And why is that beneficial?
*  Because it provides you with creative insights.
*  And so we will perhaps just double click
*  on each of those three and I can expand them
*  because the data behind them is utterly fascinating.
*  As you said, I think many people subjectively have a sense
*  that sleep helps me with my memory in some way.
*  But in what way?
*  And for people, I think one of the things that you do here
*  is not just protocols, but you help explain
*  the conceptual understanding or the conceptual mechanisms
*  underlying the reasons for all of these protocols.
*  And I would love to dive into detail.
*  Yeah, so let's do that.
*  Let's talk about this business of sleeping before learning.
*  Essentially establishing a milieu within the brain
*  that is optimal for learning.
*  What is that about neurochemically
*  at the level of circuits?
*  And what is the evidence that providing some,
*  additional sleep or just adequate sleep
*  prior to the exposure to the new material can be beneficial?
*  Yeah, I love that word, that optimal milieu,
*  and it beautifully describes what we've found.
*  We started off asking a very simple question
*  at my sleep center.
*  Is pulling the all-nighter a wise idea?
*  So we took a group of perfectly healthy, smart individuals
*  and we assigned them to one of two experimental groups,
*  a sleep group and a sleep deprivation group.
*  And both of those groups went through
*  those two different protocols.
*  And then the next day after sleep or after no sleep,
*  we put them inside of a brain scanner
*  and we had them try and learn a whole list of new facts
*  as we were taking snapshots of brain activity.
*  And then we tested them to see how effective
*  that learning had been.
*  When we looked at the group that had had a full night
*  of sleep, they had incredibly efficient learning capacity.
*  So in other words, they had learned and imprinted
*  that information initially very well.
*  When we looked at the sleep deprivation group, not so much.
*  In fact, there was a 40% deficit in the ability
*  of the brain to make new memories without sleep.
*  And we've used lots of different types.
*  We've replicated that now.
*  We've had visual information.
*  We've had textbook-like information.
*  And the range is somewhere between 20 to 40%.
*  I find that, by the way, striking.
*  And we can come back to this based on what we are seeing
*  in our educational systems right now.
*  There is this paucity of sleep because of this model
*  of early school start times.
*  And I'll explain exactly what's happened there
*  and what we've been doing to try to change that.
*  But coming back to those two groups, the sleep group
*  and the sleep deprivation group, what was going on,
*  as you said, inside of the brain that would help us
*  understand why they couldn't learn,
*  or at least couldn't learn effectively.
*  And the structure that we focused on is one
*  you've spoken about before called the hippocampus.
*  And you have one on the left side
*  and the right side of your brain.
*  It looks like a long cigar that runs down the left
*  and right side of your brain.
*  And people listening can think of the hippocampus
*  almost like the informational inbox of your brain.
*  It's very good at receiving new memory files
*  and then holding onto them.
*  And when we looked at that structure and its activity
*  during learning in the sleep group,
*  they had wonderful, powerful activation of the hippocampus
*  as if it was gobbling up all of that new information
*  into the inbox.
*  When we looked at the sleep deprivation group, however,
*  we couldn't find any significant signal whatsoever.
*  So it was almost as though sleep deprivation
*  had shut down the memory inbox
*  and any new incoming files, they were just being bounced.
*  You couldn't effectively commit new experiences to memory.
*  And then subsequent cities that were not done by us,
*  but looking at animal models,
*  they were looking at how able the synapses are
*  in that memory structure, the hippocampus,
*  how capable those synapses are for building new connections.
*  And the synapses are just those connections between neurons.
*  And we think that part of the way that we make memories
*  is by strengthening the connection
*  in the memory circuit itself.
*  And what they found was that when they restricted the sleep
*  of these rats or the mice,
*  that part of the brain became very stubborn.
*  It just wouldn't form those new synaptic connections.
*  And something that we call synaptic plasticity.
*  So we started to understand this was the bad that happened
*  when you take sleep away.
*  But let's come back to that control group
*  that I said got a full night of sleep.
*  Exactly what is it about sleep when you do get it
*  that seems to support and promote your learning ability?
*  So we decided to do another different study.
*  Instead of manipulating sleep by dialing it down,
*  we instead tried to dial it up by way of a daytime nap.
*  And again, we took two groups
*  and we had them initially learn again,
*  a huge amount of factual information.
*  They learned it over and over and over again.
*  And then we brought them back six hours later at 6 p.m.
*  And now we had them learn a whole new set of information.
*  And after each one of those fresh novel learning sessions,
*  we tested them to see how effective
*  that learning had been again.
*  One of those groups spent that six hours of time awake,
*  doing just relaxing activities.
*  The other group was able to obtain a 90 minute nap.
*  And we used that 90 minute nap to allow them
*  to go through a full sort of average cycle
*  to get some non-REM and to get some REM.
*  What was interesting is that when we tested the group
*  that remained awake later that following day,
*  their learning capacity had declined.
*  But in the nap group,
*  it seemed to restore the brain's capacity to learn.
*  And you didn't get that decline in memory.
*  In fact, if anything, you got a little boost.
*  And the difference between those two was about 20%.
*  Just quite a nice benefit.
*  Yeah, not trivial.
*  Not trivial at all.
*  And then we said, okay, well, if sleep is doing something,
*  what is it about that sleep?
*  So we unpacked the physiology of sleep
*  and the different stages of sleep
*  that we discussed in the first episode.
*  And what we found was that it was
*  the non-rapid eye movement sleep or the non-REM sleep.
*  And particularly those sleep spindles,
*  those short bursts of electrical activity
*  that we have discussed before
*  that seemed to predict how restored and refreshed
*  your learning ability was.
*  And the best way that I've been thinking about this
*  in terms of sleep restoring or refreshing
*  your encoding ability.
*  And it's a crass analogy.
*  And I don't mean to make a direct brain to computer analogy,
*  but think of that hippocampus almost like a USB stick.
*  That's very good during the day
*  at going around and grabbing new files,
*  but it has a limited storage capacity.
*  And what sleep was doing seemed to be shifting
*  those memories from the USB stick of your hippocampus
*  over up to the cortex,
*  which you can think of almost like your hard drive,
*  but with a much bigger storage capacity.
*  And by way of doing that,
*  when you woke up after the nap or after a full night of sleep,
*  you had this cleared out USB stick.
*  So what could you do?
*  You could go around and start acquiring
*  all these new files again.
*  So that started to teach us a little bit about
*  why sleep before learning is critical,
*  but also mechanistically how sleep is doing
*  this remarkable work of memory restoration.
*  We then wanted to say, well,
*  can we translate this out into the real world?
*  And I think there are two regions
*  that we've moved this work out into.
*  One is education, one is medicine and Alzheimer's disease.
*  But the education piece was very interesting.
*  In the United States, I think the last time I checked,
*  the average school start time
*  is somewhere around 7.3745.
*  Sounds about right.
*  And if you think about that for 7.30 school start times,
*  school buses will begin leaving around 5.30, 5.45
*  in the morning.
*  That means that some kids are having to wake up at 5 a.m.,
*  maybe even earlier.
*  This is lunacy when you think about it.
*  There's a great study in Edna,
*  I hope I'm pronouncing that correct, Edna,
*  which is a small suburb or it sits in a small suburb
*  outside of Minneapolis in Minnesota.
*  And they shifted their school start times
*  from 7.25 to 8.30 in the morning.
*  And then they wanted to ask,
*  what is the consequence of that
*  on the academic performance of their students?
*  And the metric that they used in these teenagers
*  that they were focusing on
*  was something called the SAT score,
*  which is a score I had to learn
*  when I first came to the United States,
*  is a critical assessment test
*  that will largely determine which university you go to.
*  And they did an analysis, which was clever.
*  They focused on the top 10% performing students,
*  which you could argue,
*  those are the ones that are closest
*  to the ceiling performance
*  and the hardest to expect any benefit from sleep.
*  So in the year before they made the time change,
*  the average score of those top 10% performing students
*  was 1,288, which turns out to be a pretty good SAT score.
*  The following year, after they made the time change,
*  the average score for that top 10% was 1,500.
*  That difference is non-trivial
*  and it will change exactly
*  where those individuals will go to university
*  in terms of the tier of the university
*  and likely change the trajectory of their lives
*  as a consequence.
*  Now, some people have argued that data,
*  you know, in terms of its source and its reliability
*  may not have necessarily been accurate,
*  but now we've got very consistent data.
*  When you start school times later, academic grades improve.
*  Psychological and psychiatric problems decrease.
*  Truancy rates decrease.
*  But something else happened in that story
*  of later school start times that we didn't expect,
*  which was that the life expectancy of students increased.
*  And you think, well, hang on a second,
*  how do you determine that?
*  The number one cause of death in teenagers 16 to 18
*  is actually not suicide.
*  Turns out to be second.
*  It's road traffic accidents.
*  And here sleep matters enormously.
*  There was another great example
*  from Tetton County in Wyoming,
*  and they shifted their school start times
*  from I think it was 7.35 in the morning to 8.55.
*  And the only thing more remarkable
*  than the extra one hour of sleep
*  those kids reported getting was the drop in car accidents.
*  That following year, there was a 70% reduction
*  in car crashes in that age range of 16 to 18.
*  What time are they getting out of school?
*  Well, they will probably be ejected out of school.
*  That's another interesting part, by the way,
*  maybe around 4.30.
*  And people have said, well, look,
*  all of this idea of later school start times,
*  it means that it's going to cost us more
*  because you've got to change the school bus system.
*  And they've argued pushback against that.
*  And I would say probably two things.
*  First, I know it's difficult,
*  and I'm not saying it's an easy problem to do,
*  it's a complex problem.
*  And I'm sympathetic to that.
*  But I think we've put people on the moon.
*  And so I suspect that we can also solve the problem
*  of early school start times.
*  The other component of that is,
*  what are we doing as educators?
*  If our goal as educators is truly to educate
*  and not risk lives in the process,
*  then we are failing our children
*  in a most spectacular manner
*  with this incessant model of early school start times.
*  And if you look at the data, it's very clear.
*  When sleep is abundant, minds flourish.
*  And when it's not, they don't.
*  And so that's the reason why myself
*  and a whole group of sleep scientists,
*  we started to try to create a movement
*  for later school start times.
*  And we got this bill passed firstly in California,
*  we got it on the governor's desk at the time,
*  it was Governor Brown.
*  He didn't sign it into law.
*  Then when the organization changed
*  and Governor Newsom came in as governor of California,
*  we got the bill back on his desk and he did sign it.
*  And then the next state to go was New York.
*  They started to put in legislation for recommendations
*  for later school start times.
*  I think Florida is about to fall as well in that regard.
*  So this gradual movement happening,
*  I think it's hard fought and it's problematic.
*  I still think that it's impossible to deny that data.
*  I mean, it was an interesting thing.
*  I remember when I was a professor back at Harvard,
*  we were doing this work on sleep and learning.
*  And it was sort of published in these sort of kindly,
*  I don't know how we did it, but in nice journals.
*  And they said, okay, based on the media traction,
*  I'm going to write an editorial for the Harvard newspaper,
*  which was called the Harvard Crimson.
*  I said, I'd love to.
*  So at first I thought I'm just going to write a straight
*  piece about sleep and memory and why it's important.
*  And I realized there's a better opportunity
*  because teaching there, and you know this as well as I do,
*  there is this bizarre system where we teach
*  for an entire semester and then we end load the semester
*  full of exams in this stressful two week period.
*  And what do you think is going to happen?
*  They're not going to sleep.
*  Especially at a time when they're trying
*  to cram information.
*  Especially in college where you don't actually
*  have the material four weeks before.
*  So there's not really the option to learn it in advance.
*  No.
*  Everything's about university to me.
*  It was about getting a bunch of information
*  and needing to incorporate it very quickly
*  and then move to the next item.
*  Right, next item, next item.
*  And then all of a sudden there's this cataclysmic moment
*  at the end of the semester and you are supposed
*  to regurgitate this by cramming everything
*  into your brain in this sleepless two week period.
*  So rather than saying look the students need
*  to change their behavior, they need to understand
*  this is a problem, it's not their fault.
*  I said it's us as educators and administrators.
*  We have created a system that forces them
*  to undergo deliberate sleep deprivation
*  and we are educating them amnesic, quite literally.
*  So I put this editorial out.
*  It received a rather Baltic, if not Arctic response
*  and that was the last editorial I was ever invited
*  to write for the newspaper.
*  But you know, you've got to say your piece.
*  Well so, but I'm curious why there's resistance
*  to shifting to later school times
*  and to improving the conditions for learning
*  if the goal is to learn.
*  I mean, tradition dies hard, maybe that's why.
*  I think there's also the idea,
*  certainly in the medical profession,
*  that you know, well when I was doing my training
*  we would pull all-nighters all the time.
*  And so the idea then is that it's just part
*  of the self-directed hazing process
*  that is getting a degree, that you're going to be doing
*  a lot of all-nighters and cramming and things of that sort.
*  Is that why you think motivates the resistance to change?
*  I think so, I think you've hit all the points.
*  I think, you know, zeitgeists die one generation at a time
*  and we see that resistance certainly there too.
*  I also think that when you come back
*  to later school start times,
*  they have suggested that there is this cost
*  when they tally it up, but you made a point
*  which is when do they get out of school?
*  And let's say it's around 4.30.
*  One of the interesting analyses that was published
*  and we latched onto this,
*  that is this strange, bewitching hour
*  when kids get out of school,
*  but often their parents are not home to work.
*  And if you look at the teenage crime rate
*  and you look at when those crimes are committed,
*  it's usually in that bewitching hour
*  after they get out of school,
*  but they don't have a home or parents yet
*  to go to that it's filled.
*  But by pushing school start times later,
*  they get out later, they go home.
*  And if you were to even half that debt
*  that those crimes cause,
*  you would easily pay for the education system.
*  So it's very interesting.
*  I think that also notion of, well, we went through it
*  and here I am so you can go through it too
*  is very prevalent in medicine.
*  This is another good example.
*  We and mostly colleagues of mine
*  such as Charles Sizler at Harvard
*  have really done a great job at cataloging
*  exactly why we need to abandon this resident program,
*  which has a fascinating history by the way,
*  which is young residents should be working 30 hour shifts
*  often without any sleep whatsoever.
*  And when you look at that data,
*  residents who are working a 30 hour shift
*  are going to be almost 460% more likely
*  to make diagnostic errors in the intensive care unit.
*  If you have a surgeon and you're getting elective surgery,
*  who's had less than six hours of sleep in the previous 24,
*  they are almost 70% more likely to cause a surgical error,
*  which could result in non-trivial consequences.
*  And then the irony is that when young residents
*  after a 30 hour shift get back into their car
*  at the end of the shift and drive home,
*  there is 168% increased risk
*  that they get into a car accident
*  and then end up back in the ER from where they just came,
*  but now as a patient rather than a physician.
*  And you think, what are we doing?
*  Charles Sizler I think has described,
*  they provided this evidence to the council
*  and at first they just, I think the idea was look,
*  our minds are made up, don't confuse me with the data.
*  And you appeal on the empathetic basis,
*  but it wasn't well received.
*  So then if you go back and you say,
*  no, I'm going to give you a different argument.
*  If you look at the cost of malpractice
*  caused by insufficient sleep,
*  and you get the administrators into the room,
*  all of a sudden the schedules change.
*  So then based on that data,
*  there was a policy that you couldn't work any longer
*  than I think it was a 16 hour continuous shift.
*  The problem was that they only said
*  that that was apparent for the first year residents
*  and not the remaining years.
*  And the question was, well, why?
*  I said, well, the data that you showed us,
*  you only collected in first year residents.
*  As if something magical was going to happen
*  when you become a second year resident
*  and you don this Teflon coat of immunity
*  against sleep deprivation.
*  Well, if anything, it would compound and get worse.
*  So it seems to me that there's like zero question
*  that getting adequate sleep is good for learning.
*  But when the stakes,
*  when it's high risk, high consequences scenarios,
*  or even high consequences scenarios,
*  like a medical situation,
*  it just seems like it should almost come down
*  to legal liability.
*  Yeah.
*  I'd like to take a brief break
*  and acknowledge our sponsor AG1.
*  AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
*  that also contains adaptogens
*  and is designed to meet all of your
*  foundational nutritional needs.
*  By now, I'm sure you've all heard me say
*  that I've been taking AG1 since 2012.
*  And indeed that is true.
*  Now, of course, I do consume regular whole foods every day.
*  I strive to get those foods mostly from unprocessed
*  or minimally processed sources.
*  However, I do find it hard to get enough servings
*  of fruits and vegetables each day.
*  So with AG1, I ensure that I get enough
*  of the vitamins, minerals, prebiotic fiber,
*  and other things typically found in fruits or vegetables.
*  And of course, I still make sure
*  to eat fruits and vegetables.
*  And in that way, provide a sort of insurance
*  that I'm getting enough of what I need.
*  In addition, the adaptogens and other micronutrients in AG1
*  really help buffer against stress
*  and ensure that the cells and organs and tissues of my body
*  are getting the things they need.
*  People often ask me that if they were gonna take
*  just one supplement, what that supplement should be.
*  And I always answer AG1.
*  If you'd like to try AG1,
*  you can go to drinkag1.com slash Huberman
*  to claim a special offer.
*  You'll get five free travel packs
*  plus a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
*  Again, that's drinkag1.com slash Huberman.
*  So are the errors of sleep deprivation in these scenarios,
*  both in students and medical professionals,
*  are they due to errors in memory per se?
*  I mean, so, I mean,
*  cause you can imagine all sorts of errors.
*  So with the surgeon, they like cut the wrong thing
*  or they cut too far.
*  The margin on the surgical site is too big, et cetera.
*  But since we're talking about learning and memory
*  and its relationship to sleep,
*  is it that people are forgetting what they did?
*  Are they forgetting what they didn't do?
*  I mean, or is it a deficit in motor skills
*  or all of the above?
*  It's all of the above plus,
*  which is that learning and memory,
*  your recollection of both what you did
*  or what you need to do or what you should do
*  based on your training is going to be compromised
*  because your recall of that information,
*  it turns out, is also compromised.
*  But it's also decision-making too,
*  that what we know is that your frontal lobe
*  is especially sensitive to a lack of sleep.
*  And it's that frontal lobe
*  that really takes complex situations, distills them down,
*  and comes up with the correct output scenario of decisions
*  that you need to make,
*  not so much when you're sleep deprived.
*  So how should I establish the proper neural milieu
*  for learning by sleeping prior?
*  Should I make sure that I,
*  I mean, in an ideal world, I get excellent night's sleep
*  for the every day of my life,
*  leading up to a bout of learning,
*  and here I'm referring to a bout of learning
*  as being exposed to new material, but life happens.
*  So if I know that tomorrow I'm going to take a class
*  in something or I'm going to need to perform a skill
*  that it's pretty nascent skill for me,
*  I only learned it recently,
*  what should I do the night before?
*  I would say think about what you can get
*  in terms of your sleep under current conditions
*  and understand that that is staying awake
*  and foregoing sleep is not the right equation
*  that you may think.
*  In other words, think of sleep that night
*  as an investment in tomorrow
*  rather than a cost opportunity of now or today.
*  That would be the message I think for learning and memory.
*  Some people will say logically and rationally,
*  well, but if I stay awake,
*  I can at least be learning and going over that material
*  for many more hours.
*  So doesn't that compensate for me going to bed?
*  Let's say I haven't learned it well enough.
*  Well, surely I should just say,
*  I should just focus and stay awake
*  because at least then I can just go over the material
*  time and time and time again.
*  Doesn't that offset the deficit?
*  And to a degree it does, we did that study.
*  But what was really interesting is that the next day
*  were you able to at least learn and recall
*  some of that information to a degree?
*  Yes, you were.
*  And the more that you kept going over it,
*  the better you performed
*  even when you were not getting sufficient sleep.
*  But then we did something interesting.
*  We then brought them back.
*  We haven't published this data, I should do.
*  We brought them back a month later
*  and then we tested them again.
*  And what you find is that the group that slept
*  was far better able to have retained
*  and remember that information.
*  Whereas the group that did not sleep as much,
*  they performed much more similar to the group
*  that got a full night of sleep the next day.
*  But when you test them a month later,
*  almost none of that material
*  is residing in their brain anymore.
*  Got it.
*  So this is the cramming effect.
*  That's right.
*  Right, and if one knows this
*  from teaching university courses,
*  or if they've crammed, that you can learn
*  a bunch of material, but then you regurgitate it
*  for the exam and then it's gone.
*  Yeah.
*  So it's almost like a, it just never passes
*  from short term to long term memory, essentially.
*  That's correct. Okay.
*  And that seems to be, in some ways,
*  that's a beautiful description of then
*  what happens next in the sleep process.
*  It's not just about sleep before learning.
*  You then have to sleep after learning
*  to do exactly what you just described.
*  So I have a class in the morning,
*  or I'm going to learn something new the next day afternoon.
*  My goal, presumably, should be to maximize
*  the amount of sleep I get,
*  and to be on the same sleep schedule.
*  So this gets back to QQRT that was presented
*  in the first episode, quantity, quality,
*  regularity, and timing.
*  And people should refer to that.
*  Nothing wrong with your memory, by the way.
*  Well, I don't know about that, but
*  the QQRT formula was described in the first episode.
*  Let's come up with what I think is a fairly common scenario.
*  So I like to go to bed early, between eight and nine p.m.
*  I discovered this recently, thanks to conversations with you.
*  This is clearly what works best for me.
*  I kind of always intuit it, but it clearly
*  is what works best.
*  If I go to bed at 10, I probably want to wake up
*  sometime around, I don't know, 6 a.m. or 6.30.
*  And if I go to bed any later than 10.30,
*  I start running into problems.
*  I don't feel good the next day,
*  even if I get sufficient hours of sleep.
*  So this is the importance of regularity and timing,
*  keeping things more or less locked to that
*  8.30 to 9.30 to bedtime for me,
*  4.30 to 5.30 wake up time.
*  That's me.
*  Just by way of example, in an ideal world, therefore,
*  I would stick to that schedule, wake up the next day
*  and go do my learning or my performance
*  of something that I had learned.
*  Someone else might have the chronotype,
*  we're going to bed at 11 p.m. and waking up at 7.30 a.m.
*  is their preferred schedule.
*  However, often because of travel, because of courses,
*  because of life circumstances,
*  the night before something critical that we need to learn
*  or to perform some critical task, physical or cognitive,
*  the sleep the night before is disrupted in some way,
*  either by virtue of timing or quantity,
*  and then of course, by extension, regularity.
*  So is there anything that we can do
*  heading into a bout of learning,
*  meaning the night preceding that bout of learning
*  that can kind of provide a buffer
*  or set us up for the best possible learning scenario
*  if we're not able to stick to our perfect schedule?
*  I think there may be two things,
*  there's been a little bit of work
*  that's been done to suggest that caffeine
*  may actually enhance the hippocampus,
*  this memory encoding structure,
*  and boost its ability to encode.
*  Now what they haven't yet done is the study
*  where you sleep deprive someone,
*  then you give them caffeine the next day,
*  and then you have them try to learn and ask,
*  can caffeine by way of its effect on the hippocampus
*  rescue and restore what would otherwise
*  be an encoding deficit?
*  Now that is entirely possible,
*  and I think it's a fascinating question,
*  by how much, we don't know.
*  But if it doesn't, it's equally likely
*  that the hippocampus, by way of being sleep deprived,
*  is not receptive to the benefit of caffeine
*  under conditions of sleep deprivation.
*  And I told you in the rat studies,
*  when those rats were deprived,
*  the hippocampus once again became stubborn
*  in its ability to form new synapses,
*  and it may be that it's equally stubborn
*  to receive the normal benefit of caffeine
*  when you are sleep rested.
*  But I would love to do that study.
*  The second is to then say, well, if I have the choice
*  of when I'm going to be learning during the day,
*  let's say that you've had a bad night of sleep
*  or you just had a short night of sleep,
*  non-negotiable, couldn't do anything about it,
*  and the next day I've got to cram in some information,
*  I would say, think about your chronotype,
*  and think about when you are
*  at your best operating temperature.
*  So your scenario, let's say going to bed at nine,
*  waking up at 4.30, five, your peak is probably going
*  to be maybe 10, 11 o'clock in the morning
*  where your biology and your circadian rhythm
*  is on its almost crescendo peak.
*  At that point, we know for circadian influences on learning,
*  and this is independent of sleep influences on learning,
*  now for me, you actually described me,
*  which is I'm a kind of an 11 to 7.30 type person.
*  For me, it's probably going to be much closer
*  to about midday or 1 p.m.
*  where I feel at my operating peak,
*  both for physical performance and also mental performance.
*  So if you've got the choice and you are under slept,
*  there's nothing you can do about the sleep
*  that you've lost the night before,
*  but at least recognize that your circadian rhythm
*  is going to come to your rescue and help offset that
*  as long as you time your learning
*  to that known peak of your circadian rhythm.
*  Does that help a little bit?
*  Yes, that makes good sense.
*  So the idea gets us back to something you described
*  in previous episodes, which is that you have
*  this sleep pressure due to the buildup
*  of the molecule adenosine, which the longer we are awake,
*  the more adenosine in our nervous system,
*  which makes us sleepy.
*  But separate from that, there's this circadian, circadia,
*  about 24 hour rhythm, right?
*  That causes fairly dramatic shifts in wakefulness
*  and sleepiness independent of the adenosine signal.
*  Now, sometimes the two signals overlap,
*  so that late in the evening, for instance,
*  we have a lot of adenosine, we've been up all day,
*  and our circadian rhythm is such that our alertness
*  is starting to diminish, so they're aligned.
*  And in the early part of the day,
*  assuming everything is normal,
*  the adenosine levels are low
*  because we slept well the night before,
*  and our circadian rhythm is on the upswing.
*  So to speak, and we are alert.
*  So if I understand correctly, the goal is to, of course,
*  maximize the quality, quantity, regularity,
*  and timing of sleep, QQRT,
*  but that in the absence of the ability
*  to really anchor any one of those things
*  to 10 out of 10, A plus performance,
*  if one knows that, okay, typically around
*  between 10 a.m. and noon is when I'm at my sharpest,
*  that would be the time to be exposed to new material,
*  or ideally take an exam,
*  if one can control that sort of thing.
*  And then perhaps in the afternoon,
*  there's another opportunity after the postprandial dip.
*  That's right.
*  But before the postprandial dip,
*  sometime between one and four p.m.,
*  usually lasting about an hour to 90 minutes,
*  this is a natural dip in energy,
*  but then after that, there's another opportunity to learn,
*  sure, there'll be a lot of adenosine in one system
*  because you've been up a long time,
*  but the circadian system is on its sort of upswing again
*  before the downswing that occurs in the evening.
*  Is that right?
*  That's right.
*  So you can cut-
*  So you've got two opportunities.
*  And by the way, it's strange, you were to ask,
*  if you look at the circadian rhythm,
*  right before sort of bedtime,
*  there is this sort of strange little blip,
*  this peak that folks at Harvard have discovered,
*  and you think, well, why would my circadian system,
*  which needs to really ratchet down
*  for us to get to sleep well,
*  why would it have this little jag upwards
*  in the evening hours right before we need to sleep
*  and it then drops precipitously?
*  Right.
*  Makes no sense until you think about evolution
*  because after foraging for food during the day,
*  what you need is this final spurt
*  to get you home safely to your nest or to your home.
*  To batten down the hatches.
*  Exactly.
*  So there is this beautiful little built-in circadian upswing
*  to say, okay, I know you're returning to home.
*  This is probably a time
*  when there's some maybe potential threat to you.
*  I'm gonna just boost your alertness very quickly
*  so you travel home safely.
*  Good to go, great.
*  And now I start my downswing.
*  I think this is a really important thing
*  for people to know about.
*  I'm familiar with the data, although just in top contour,
*  but the idea here, as I understand it,
*  is that many people will feel like,
*  okay, around 6 p.m., 6.30, they're getting sleepy,
*  7.30, 8 p.m., and then they wanna get to bed at 10.30
*  and suddenly for them, based on their chronotype,
*  around 9 p.m., they're like wide awake.
*  Second wind.
*  Right, the second wind and they're like,
*  oh no, I need to sleep tonight.
*  Now maybe it's the case that they're,
*  they would be better off going to bed far earlier
*  and waking up earlier the next morning,
*  but in many cases, it's just that transient 45 to 60,
*  70 minute window of increased alertness.
*  That's right.
*  This kind of uptick in the circadian alertness system.
*  So it's just the- Yeah, this too shall pass.
*  And then also just set yourself up for success
*  and we discussed a little bit about the methods
*  of really ratcheting things down, dimming down the lights,
*  having it to bed alarm.
*  These types of things will just gradually back you off
*  and after that second wind comes,
*  give you the greatest ability to decline physiologically,
*  which then commits this beautiful thing called sleep
*  to come in its place.
*  Well, speaking of sleep post-learning,
*  what is the role of sleep that follows about learning?
*  And here again, we wanna define learning
*  as the exposure to novel information
*  that one is trying to encode,
*  either cognitive information, motor information,
*  or a combination of the two.
*  And I say that because learning, AKA neuroplasticity,
*  has many different stages.
*  It's a process, not an event.
*  So let's say that earlier in the day,
*  I took a dance class, Lord knows I need one,
*  or a musical lesson,
*  or was exposed to some interesting information,
*  who knows, maybe on a podcast,
*  and I was trying to engage in that information
*  and pay attention.
*  And then that night, I planned to sleep,
*  or perhaps wanted to take a nap after this bout of learning.
*  How close to the learning episode about, as I'm calling it,
*  does the sleep have to arrive
*  in order for sleep to maximize
*  the amount of learning that occurs?
*  It's a very good question, which is,
*  what would happen if I were to be learning information
*  and I'm listening to this odd British gentleman,
*  should I then immediately dive into bed
*  so that I maximize the retention of that information?
*  And the answer is no, don't worry.
*  I'll come back to why not to worry.
*  But to your point, not only do you need sleep
*  for learning, as we've been discussing,
*  but there is something unique and equally necessary of,
*  and causally necessary, I should say,
*  for sleep after learning, but it does something different.
*  Sleep before learning gets your brain ready
*  to lay down those new memory traces.
*  After you've imprinted them into the brain,
*  sleep after learning then takes
*  those freshly minted memories,
*  and then it strengthens them.
*  Essentially, it's almost like sleep will hit the save button
*  on those new memories so that you don't forget.
*  So in other words, sleep is future-proofing
*  that information within your brain so that you don't forget.
*  And then the question, and we've been able to,
*  and we and many others have replicated this,
*  in fact, it's nothing new.
*  If you look at the literature
*  on this sleep after learning gig,
*  it goes back as best we can tell to 1929,
*  although I'll argue with that in a second,
*  but two researchers, Jenkins and Dahlbach,
*  did a landmark study.
*  They had participants learn a whole bunch
*  of nonsense syllables, and they had them learn them
*  over and over and over again, and gradually they got better.
*  And then they started to test them
*  across an eight-hour period.
*  They tested them two hours later, four hours later,
*  six hours later, and eight hours later.
*  The only difference is that in one of those testing sessions,
*  that two hours, four hours, six hours, eight hours
*  was across a waking day.
*  In the other, they had them learn that information
*  to near perfection before sleep,
*  just as they did in the waking group.
*  But now they woke them up after two hours and tested them,
*  after four hours and tested them, after six hours,
*  and then again, when they woke up in the morning,
*  eight hours later.
*  And what they found is that in those people
*  who stayed awake after learning,
*  there was essentially just catastrophic forgetting.
*  The amount of information, two hours, four hours,
*  six hours, eight hours later, just declined dramatically.
*  But when they repeated that in the same individuals,
*  after learning things to the same degree,
*  two hours, four hours later, memory was starting to decline.
*  But after about two and a half, three hours of being asleep,
*  all of a sudden, sleep had fixated those memories,
*  almost like an animal that's been trapped in amber
*  and set in amber like a fossil.
*  And then those memories just would not decay any further,
*  and you retained them.
*  What was stunning about that study
*  is it has been replicated time and time again.
*  That's not the surprising part.
*  The surprising part is that in that study,
*  they tested a vast number of subjects,
*  in fact, a sum total of two participants.
*  But what's stunning is that that finding has gone
*  and been replicated time and time again.
*  So that demonstrated to us
*  that there's something special about sleep
*  that is concretizing, almost literally,
*  like taking things and setting it in concrete.
*  And then the question became, again, mechanistically, how?
*  How is it, and it's important to understand mechanism
*  because it has ramifications for diseases and medicine.
*  How is sleep doing this fantastic saving of memories?
*  And we now have at least two
*  non-mutually exclusive mechanisms.
*  So in other words, both seem to occur.
*  The first is what we call memory translocation.
*  Sleep and particularly what we found for fact-based memories,
*  and I should note, by the way,
*  that this story of sleep after learning is a two-part,
*  or it runs in two different narratives.
*  One is sleep after learning for fact-based memory,
*  what we describe as declarative memory.
*  And you've done a fantastic previous episode
*  on working memory and describe
*  all of these different types of memory.
*  So one storyline has been sleep
*  after learning for fact-based memory,
*  but the other, which is equally interesting,
*  is sleep for non-declarative or procedural skill memory.
*  In other words, what we think of as motor memory.
*  But I'll come back to motor memory in a second.
*  What we then found for this sleep and textbook-like memory
*  is that there are two mechanisms.
*  The first, translocation.
*  And here what we found is that it's deep,
*  non-REM sleep for fact-based memories.
*  And it's those big, slow, powerful brain waves
*  that we spoke about in the first episode,
*  combined with those sleep spindles that ride on top of them,
*  almost like a surfer on a huge amplitude wave.
*  And it's the combination of those two brain waves
*  that acts like a file transfer mechanism.
*  And it moves and shifts memories
*  from a short-term vulnerable reservoir, the hippocampus,
*  to the more permanent long-term storage site,
*  the cortex in the brain,
*  and therefore protecting them and making them safe.
*  So that's one mechanism,
*  is the shifting of memories around the brain
*  and through different storage sites
*  from short-term to long-term.
*  The second, I think, is perhaps even more fascinating.
*  It's called memory replay.
*  And this was discovered back in the probably 1990s.
*  Bruce McNaughton at the University of Arizona
*  working with a young Matt Wilson, who,
*  not Matt Walker, he's Matt Wilson at MIT now.
*  They were looking at rats,
*  and they were looking at how rats learn a maze.
*  And they had these electrodes
*  in these hippocampal brain regions,
*  these memory-related regions that we've been discussing.
*  And they were listening to the individual firing patterns
*  of those memory cells in the hippocampus
*  as they were running around the maze.
*  And sure enough, as they ran around the maze,
*  statistically, you would build up what looked like
*  the signature pattern of learning.
*  So think about those neurons
*  that they each had a special tone to them.
*  And as the rat is running around the maze,
*  you can hear the signature of learning.
*  Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.
*  I just went over and over again.
*  But then they did something clever.
*  When the rats went to sleep after learning,
*  they kept listening.
*  What did they hear?
*  They didn't just hear noise.
*  They heard that same memory signature replayed.
*  However, it wasn't replayed at the same speed.
*  It was replayed somewhere between 10 to 20 times faster.
*  So now all of a sudden, instead of hearing,
*  bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum,
*  you heard, brum, brum, brum, brum, brum, brum, brum, brum, brum.
*  It's going over and over again.
*  And what we've learned is that this replay of memories
*  for that type of information, now for rats,
*  that their version essentially of spatial navigation
*  is their version of fact-based memory.
*  I won't go into detail, but.
*  Yeah, because navigating novel environments
*  is especially important for all species,
*  but rodents to know where they cached food,
*  where escapes are, and things of that sort.
*  Yeah, perhaps even more so than us humans,
*  that locational memory is necessary.
*  And nowadays there's Google Maps and Uber
*  and things of that sort, but in the old days,
*  as it were, I recall the London taxi drivers
*  were considered the world heavyweight champions of memory.
*  And there were some decent brain imaging studies
*  of their hippocampi.
*  And indeed they have amazing spatial memory
*  of the city of London.
*  Now that's probably changed because of Google Maps.
*  There's no need to rely on internal memory stores
*  when you have.
*  No, you still actually, there's still a,
*  now you can drive these ride share apps,
*  but for London taxi drivers, they still have to go through.
*  In some ways it's almost like a hazing.
*  It's called the knowledge.
*  And if you are visiting London,
*  you will see these strange guys
*  who are going around on mopeds
*  and they just have this huge kind of map in front of them.
*  And they are doing the knowledge,
*  which is that they are learning exquisitely
*  the entire roadmap of London.
*  And what they found in those studies
*  was that the size of the hippocampus,
*  this memory structure related to fact-based memories
*  and also spatial memories was significantly larger
*  in cab drivers than it was in matched controls.
*  Now you could say, well, this is a self-selecting process
*  that people who already have large hippocampi,
*  as we would say, they're just going to be the people
*  who can do the knowledge well and pass as it were.
*  But what they also found was that correlation,
*  the longer that you've been doing the knowledge
*  and being a taxi driver,
*  the bigger and bigger your hippocampus.
*  So it's time on task.
*  So coming back to the rats and this spatial learning,
*  it's almost as though sleep after learning
*  is taking that memory trace
*  and it's like etching into a glass surface.
*  You just go over that memory circuit
*  over and over again
*  and you're strengthening that memory circuit.
*  What was also fascinating, however,
*  I'm telling you that it's during non-REM sleep
*  that you do all of this memory replay.
*  And certainly what we found is that for textbook memory,
*  it's deep non-REM sleep.
*  That's the important stage of sleep.
*  But Matt Wilson published at MIT an interesting study
*  looking at REM sleep.
*  What happens to the memory trace in REM sleep?
*  And REM sleep, which we know is associated
*  with dreaming,
*  that the memory replay didn't slow back down
*  to normal waking speed.
*  It slowed down even further to 0.5 times
*  relative to waking speed.
*  So the waking speed versus the dreaming speed
*  in dreaming sort of in REM sleep, I should say,
*  because we don't know if rats dream or not,
*  but in REM sleep,
*  things had slowed down by essentially 50%.
*  And this comes back to our conversation
*  in a previous episode that we had about time.
*  And you and I were discussing
*  how there's this strange phenomenon
*  where you are woken up by your alarm and you're in a dream,
*  and you have a snooze button that lasts five minutes.
*  You hit the snooze button, you go back to sleep,
*  and you feel as though you've been dreaming
*  for 10 minutes, 15 minutes,
*  but it's been five minutes in the real world,
*  but time has slowed down, time has dilated.
*  It's almost like a concertina that stretched out.
*  And all of a sudden we were finding in,
*  or Matt Wilson, because we don't do animal research,
*  was finding that this replay was slowed down by 50%.
*  So I always wonder whether or not
*  there is neuronal evidence that helps us explain
*  why dreams seem to pack more time
*  despite being in real world time a shorter amount.
*  Absolutely fascinating.
*  Yeah, I have to imagine that rats dream and dogs dream,
*  another animal's dream.
*  I mean, why wouldn't they?
*  If all the components of REM sleep
*  that are expressed in humans appear in these animals
*  and vice versa, you imagine it almost has to be the case.
*  It does, and I think there is some interesting
*  supportive evidence that you can argue.
*  There is a sleep disorder that we understood in humans first
*  called rapid eye movement disorder,
*  or REM sleep behavioral disorder.
*  And in the first episode,
*  we said that one of the fascinating features of REM sleep,
*  which is when we principally dream,
*  is that your brain, and specifically your brain stem,
*  paralyzes your body so that your mind can dream safely.
*  So you're shut down into this motor paralysis incarceration,
*  rightly so.
*  But what also happens is that as we get older,
*  and it seems to be particularly more so in men
*  than in women, but it can be both,
*  once we get past our 50s, there is a higher likelihood
*  that that mechanism starts to degrade,
*  and you can start to act out your dreams.
*  Now, this is not sleepwalking or sleep talking.
*  That actually comes from deep non-REM sleep.
*  And there, what happens is that there is a trigger,
*  an awakening, either a brain response,
*  almost like a stress response, that wakes the brain up,
*  and you're in the deeper stages of sleep,
*  and you are trying to get force back up to wakefulness.
*  Back to that analogy of going from the basement
*  to the penthouse.
*  And instead, you just get locked into this mixed state
*  of consciousness.
*  And as a consequence, you start to enact
*  very rote, basic behaviors.
*  You'll go over to the refrigerator, open the door,
*  close the door, pick up a glass, put it to your mouth,
*  put it back down.
*  And if you wake someone up,
*  which you shouldn't necessarily do unless there's harm,
*  and ask them, what was going through your mind
*  just a few minutes ago?
*  They all say nothing.
*  And the reason is because it wasn't coming from dream sleep,
*  it was from deep non-REM sleep.
*  I see.
*  However, there is a very different condition
*  that sometimes people will mix up as the very same thing,
*  which is REM sleep, behavioral disorder.
*  And there, you're acting out your dreams.
*  It can be quite violent.
*  Some people have enacted violence on their partner
*  and woken up and been absolutely devastated.
*  I bring this up, however, because human beings
*  are not the only species that suffers
*  from REM sleep behavioral disorder.
*  Dogs suffer from this as well.
*  And when you see it, and you can understand it,
*  and it's very clear, you have electrodes on the head,
*  they go into this REM sleep state,
*  and all of a sudden they come out of the paralysis,
*  and they start enacting what very much looks like
*  a behavior of wakefulness.
*  It's quite complex.
*  And at that point, you look at that and you say,
*  okay, I'm sorry, but that looks very much like dreaming.
*  Now we can't, of course, ask dogs a question,
*  what was going through your mind.
*  You can ask them, but they're not gonna answer.
*  But yeah, you can ask them,
*  but it turns out that their response is less than,
*  it's just a look to say, give me a treat.
*  But in science, sometimes, if it looks like a duck,
*  talks like a duck, walks like a duck, maybe it's a duck.
*  What about this phenomenon, which I've experienced before,
*  of being asleep, presumably in rapid eye movement sleep
*  and being completely paralyzed, but then waking up,
*  and I'm still in paralysis, but I'm not asleep.
*  And this was a long time ago, probably the 10th grade,
*  which for me, I was, what, 15 years old, I'm 48 now,
*  and was at a party that I fell asleep on the couch.
*  And I, goodness, I don't believe in underage drinking,
*  but there's a possibility
*  that I might've been inebriated.
*  I was, kids, parents, I actively dissuade young people
*  from drinking, and many older people from drinking.
*  But yeah, I started drinking far too young.
*  And, but I remember, I drank the night before,
*  I got drunk the night before,
*  again, something I'm not suggesting or proud of.
*  I woke up and I was wide awake, gosh,
*  I remember this so well, and I was paralyzed.
*  I could not move, and it was terrifying.
*  And then all of a sudden, boom, I could jolt myself awake,
*  and I was like, oh my goodness.
*  And it must've been an invasion of that atonia,
*  that sleep-induced paralysis into the waking state.
*  So I can explain this, and you have,
*  this is the perfect prototypical situation
*  when we see this.
*  What you're describing to me is something
*  that many people listening will have experienced
*  called REM sleep paralysis.
*  And it's not necessarily a problem or a sign
*  of a condition that you need to be worried about,
*  although if it's happening frequently,
*  we can think about that.
*  What normally happens when we wake up out of REM sleep,
*  and REM sleep, as we spoke about in the first episode,
*  dominates the second half of the night,
*  and particularly the last quarter of the night.
*  As you're coming out of REM sleep,
*  and waking up out of REM sleep,
*  which, you know, you've got a 50-50% chance, perhaps,
*  because the other state that you're in
*  is stage two light non-REM.
*  As you're coming out of REM sleep,
*  you're regaining consciousness to the external world,
*  and then normally in lockstep with that,
*  perfect lockstep, if not a little before,
*  your brain is realizing this,
*  and it's releasing you from the paralysis,
*  and we all wake up, and we don't even think about it.
*  I just wake up, and I lean over,
*  I turn off the alarm, and I get out of bed.
*  Everything's fine.
*  Every now and again, however,
*  the waking up and consciousness re-engaging occurs.
*  However, the brain does not release you
*  from the REM sleep paralysis.
*  So at that point, it's almost like
*  a locked-in body phenomenon,
*  and it's very frightening because you begin to be aware
*  of your surroundings,
*  but you cannot make any voluntary movements,
*  because I told you that the voluntary skeletal muscle system
*  is impaired by the atonia, the absence of muscle.
*  You're involuntary, you're still breathing,
*  but your eyelids turn out to be part of your
*  voluntary muscle set.
*  So you can't lift up your eyelids,
*  and then normally what happens is that
*  it's associated with a strong sense of,
*  often an intruder, it seems to be,
*  if you're doing it sort of in bed by yourself at home.
*  Now your context is a little different,
*  and it turns out that if you look
*  at these descriptions of sleep paralysis
*  where you can't wake up, you can't shout out,
*  you can't move, you have this sense of another presence
*  or another being in the room,
*  it adequately explains most, if not all,
*  alien abduction stories.
*  Because when was the last time you saw a news article
*  or on the news that someone said,
*  okay, today it was very clear that Jimmy in Wisconsin
*  in the middle of the day was abducted by aliens,
*  and everyone saw it.
*  You're at the meeting table and whoosh, what happened?
*  That was Jimmy, just got whisked off by aliens.
*  Doesn't happen that way.
*  It's normally that you're in bed at night,
*  it's the early morning hours just before you're waking up,
*  these aliens came into the room,
*  they injected something into you, they paralyzed you,
*  you couldn't shout, you couldn't move.
*  It simply ramps the paralysis.
*  Now when do we see that?
*  There are ways, and not ways,
*  because these are not protocols that we advise,
*  there are circumstances where the probability
*  of that increases, and I've experienced this too.
*  When you are sleep deprived or you are highly stressed,
*  the likelihood that you will experience
*  these REM sleep paralysis events upon awakening is increased.
*  And for me it was happening when I was a young PhD student
*  and I was studying sleep, and then I would be awake
*  all night because I'd be monitoring the patients
*  and looking at their sleep.
*  The irony of sleep studies.
*  Exactly, that you have to deprive yourself
*  of the very thing that you are trying to study.
*  Which by the way gives you some amazing insights
*  for experiments that I've had as a consequence,
*  not that I would advise that as the way,
*  and we'll come on to why that's,
*  not why when we speak about creativity,
*  but we were doing these studies and then I would go home
*  and then I would take a short period of sleep,
*  maybe just two and a half hours of sleep,
*  and then I would wake up, I didn't want to,
*  because I was ready to go deep into sleep,
*  but I would wake up and then I would force myself
*  to be awake throughout the day and try to get to bed
*  at a reasonable time because if I slept all day,
*  what's gonna happen?
*  I'm just gonna be awake all the next night
*  and I'm gonna be out of my rhythm.
*  But what's interesting is that when I would wake up then,
*  I would be waking up maybe at 10 a.m. in the morning, 11,
*  and at that point if you're sleeping there
*  with someone like my face, you are in a very REM sleep
*  desiring state that it's in those last morning hours
*  and into the early morning hours when your brain wants
*  to devour off the menu of sleep stages,
*  this thing called REM in vast quantities.
*  So I was sleep deprived, point number one.
*  Second, I was going into a very REM sleep rich phase,
*  in other words, higher likelihood of paralysis,
*  and that occurred to me.
*  Your description is also prototypical.
*  You've been drinking the night before,
*  went out to the party.
*  We spoke about in one of our previous episodes
*  that one of the problems with alcohol
*  is that it's very good at blocking your REM sleep.
*  So you'd been absent of REM sleep the prior night.
*  You'd built up what we call a REM sleep debt.
*  And when you slept, all of a sudden
*  what your brain wanted more,
*  because it at least got some sleep
*  and there you're going to get mostly your deep sleep,
*  the debt on the sheets of your balance account for sleep
*  was not so great for deep non-REM,
*  but you were very much in debt with REM.
*  So what happened?
*  As soon as you conked out on the couch,
*  whoosh, you were probably straight into REM sleep.
*  And then when you woke up,
*  you had this mismatch in timing between consciousness
*  and the release of paralysis.
*  What did you experience?
*  REM sleep paralysis.
*  Love it.
*  I mean, hate it.
*  Yes. I did not enjoy it,
*  but I love your description.
*  It's because it makes so very clear what happened.
*  And for those that have had the experience,
*  it can be mildly stressful to terrifying.
*  So thank you for providing the therapy that is knowledge
*  and so that people don't stress it too much,
*  but we still dissuade people from consuming alcohol
*  prior to sleep.
*  Correct.

*  can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.
*  The problem with a lot of blood tests out there, however,
*  is that you get information back
*  about metabolic factors, hormones, et cetera,
*  but you don't know what to do with that information.
*  With InsideTracker,
*  they make it very easy to understand your results

*  Okay, so we've been discussing complete paralysis
*  and of course that's the inability to move.
*  Let's talk about the ability to move,
*  meaning motor learning.
*  What is the relationship between sleep
*  and learning physical skills,
*  either coordination of motor movement
*  or who knows, maybe increased power output or endurance?
*  And if you would, could you comment on whether or not
*  there are specific phases of sleep
*  that are specifically linked to motor learning?
*  Yeah, great question.
*  So what we've spoken about so far is that you need sleep
*  after learning for that textbook-like memory
*  and that is one category of memory
*  that resides within your brain.
*  There's another type of memory that you've spoken about
*  which many of us don't realize is memory
*  and that's what we call non-declarative
*  or procedural skill memory.
*  So if I were to ask you, okay, Andrew,
*  last night for dinner or yesterday for lunch,
*  do you remember what it was that you had to eat?
*  And my guess is that you could probably tell me.
*  So do you recall what some of that food was?
*  My diet's pretty boring.
*  In a sense, I tend to eat more or less
*  the same thing every day,
*  although I'm open to being flexible.
*  Yesterday for lunch, I had two grass-fed hamburger patties,
*  maybe a little bit of rice, a slice of cucumber,
*  some tomatoes, and because I'm a drive-by blueberry eater,
*  there were some blueberries out on the counter
*  and I had several large fistfuls of those.
*  And then I washed it down with some water
*  and a half mug, just like this,
*  of some cold brew sugar-free yerba mate.
*  And I can confirm, folks, I was there at the incident
*  and that's exactly what he had.
*  But did everyone who was watching or listening
*  just realize what happened in this room today?
*  Something that Einstein suggested would never be possible,
*  that Andrew just traveled back in time,
*  that using this incredible gift of memory,
*  you folded time, almost like a concertina compressing it,
*  and you raced back within milliseconds,
*  you were shaking your head, yes, I know what I had,
*  and you raced back into that catalog
*  of all of your previous lunches,
*  you found the correct manila folder
*  for that specific lunch, all of the details,
*  and out it popped.
*  That is a spectacularly complex computational process
*  that your brain's memory system
*  accomplish within milliseconds.
*  It's stunning what we have as this gift of memory.
*  But as I said, there's another type of memory.
*  So if I were to ask you, okay, how do you ride a bike?
*  It's very difficult, there is no textbook
*  for here is how to ride a bike.
*  The way that you do it when you're a child
*  is that you are taught how to learn how to ride a bike
*  by being on it.
*  So if I were to say, how,
*  because I'm a long time cyclist,
*  how do I take a right turn with my bicycle?
*  The obvious suggestion would be,
*  well, you turn the handlebars.
*  If you turn the handlebars at 30 miles an hour,
*  trying to go around a right bend,
*  you're gonna crash very quickly.
*  What in fact you do is you alter the steering angle
*  just a little, but you lean.
*  And that is what we call non-declarative,
*  meaning you can't declare to me what it is that you know,
*  you just have to show me through action and behavior.
*  This is skill learning.
*  And we use it for things like sports,
*  surgical procedures, flying planes.
*  There are so many musical performance as well,
*  so many aspects.
*  So we wanted to then say, well,
*  sleep is helpful after learning for fact-based memory,
*  but what about this other type of memory?
*  And in truth, I didn't come up with the idea.
*  It was given to me back in the,
*  gosh, I'm aging myself, in the early 2000s,
*  I was back in the UK and I gave a lecture
*  for the decade of the brain, which it was back then.
*  And at the end of the course,
*  I'd spoken a little bit about sleep
*  and this informational processing,
*  but no evidence for motor skill memory.
*  And this gentleman, beautiful, lovely gentleman,
*  old gentleman with a sort of a white beard.
*  I remember his tweed jacket, this green hue, it was beautiful.
*  And he came up to me at the end and he said,
*  look, I'm a musician, I'm a pianist.
*  And I was fascinated by what you said about sleep.
*  Sometimes I'll sit down and I'm learning a new piece
*  and I just don't seem to be able to get it.
*  And I practice, practice and practice into the evening.
*  And then I just stop.
*  And then I come back the next day
*  and I sit down at the piano
*  and I can just play.
*  Do you think that's sleep?
*  And of course, at that moment,
*  my mind starts just Rodexing with ideas.
*  And I'm thinking, gosh,
*  there's the next 10 years of my work and grants.
*  And so I sort of said, look,
*  I think it's a fascinating hypothesis.
*  It could also be that you're just maybe
*  a little bit tired in the evening.
*  But it's entirely possible.
*  I don't know of any evidence yet that supports that.
*  I suppose the alternative hypothesis
*  that there's simply a certain amount of time
*  that needs to elapse after experiencing something new
*  that one wants to learn.
*  The trigger for learning is some biochemical
*  slash neural signal.
*  That's like a wave front.
*  And it takes a while for that wave to go ashore,
*  which is learning.
*  And that independent of how much sleep one gets
*  or the quality of sleep that the learning could occur.
*  I suppose that's one idea.
*  No, that's in fact precisely the central hypothesis
*  that we then set out to test,
*  which is that maybe it's practice,
*  then some time that helps you
*  create that perfect motor routine.
*  That's one hypothesis, but let's split that apart.
*  Maybe it's time, but time spent awake,
*  or is it time, but time spent asleep?
*  So we designed a study to disambiguate between those two.
*  Both groups learned a motor skill task.
*  And it's very much like learning a piano.
*  And you learn a sequence of movements.
*  Let's just say four, one, three, two, four.
*  And we have you type that out over and over again
*  for periods of 30 seconds,
*  and then you rest for 30 seconds, and then you do it again.
*  You do 12 of those trials.
*  And sure enough, practice seemed to get you better.
*  And you were learning, and your learning curve went up.
*  And then we brought those participants back 12 hours later,
*  and we retested them on that same motor memory.
*  Half of those participants spent that 12 hours awake.
*  The others had a night of sleep in between,
*  an eight hour night of sleep.
*  When we brought the people who had learned in the morning
*  and tested in the evening without sleep,
*  they had retained that memory.
*  They were no worse, they were just no better.
*  But in the people who had slept,
*  what was stunning was that they had improved
*  their performance output speed by 20%,
*  and they'd improved their accuracy by almost 37%.
*  Wow.
*  So in other words, it wasn't time that you needed
*  to produce perfection.
*  It was time with sleep.
*  In other words, you've often heard the statement,
*  practice makes perfect, but we violated that edict.
*  It wasn't practice that makes perfect.
*  It's practice with a night of sleep
*  that makes or leads to perfection.
*  In other words, after learning,
*  your brain continues to improve
*  in the absence of any further practice.
*  However, that learning occurs exclusively
*  during periods of offline sleep
*  and not across equivalent time periods while you're awake.
*  Now, what was interesting in the group
*  that remained awake across those 12 hours,
*  we then actually brought them back after a further 12 hours,
*  but now after a night of sleep,
*  and they showed that beautiful benefit.
*  So the sleep that can, let's say, enhance,
*  although I think what we're really talking about here
*  that consolidates motor learning,
*  can arrive the night after,
*  meaning one finishes, let's say, learning at 11 a.m.,
*  and then they sleep later that night,
*  or the following night, and in both instances,
*  that sleep can enhance or, let's say,
*  consolidate the motor learning that occurred.
*  That's right, so it was to your question, actually,
*  that we discussed earlier, and I recall now,
*  I didn't answer it, which is that the things
*  that you learn throughout the day,
*  you don't have to worry about learning them
*  really close to bedtime so that they're available
*  and accessible for this sleep-dependent work
*  of sleep after learning.
*  It seems to be that the human brain,
*  and we've plotted this, we've looked at how
*  at what point does the brain sort of fail
*  in terms of its ability to place on hold,
*  sort of on the runway, ready to take off
*  into the consolidation phase,
*  and it seems to be about 16 hours
*  that you can hold on to those freshly formed memories
*  for about 16 hours, and then you get the chance
*  to sleep and consolidate them.
*  So if you learn at 11 o'clock in the morning,
*  or if you learn at 7 p.m. in the evening,
*  don't worry about that.
*  Those memories are still going to be gathered together
*  in the beautiful receptive arms of sleep,
*  and then knitted up and enhanced
*  when it comes to procedural memories.
*  And by the way, that's the key difference
*  to those two types of memory.
*  Sleep will take fact-based memories
*  and simply save them so that you don't forget.
*  It doesn't necessarily boost them anymore.
*  It just simply prevents you from forgetting,
*  which is what would happen otherwise across a waking day.
*  It's not enhancement, it's consolidation of,
*  or essentially, the way I might think about it
*  is the new information is put into a potential memory bank,
*  and that information is either flushed or maintained
*  depending on whether or not you get sleep.
*  That's right.
*  There's no enhancement.
*  Enhancement would be supranormal levels of memory
*  if you sleep.
*  And that's the case for textbook-like memory.
*  In other words, sleep comes in,
*  and it stems the blood flow of forgetting
*  from the memory wound, as it were, to get.
*  I don't know why it came up with,
*  that's a terrible analogy.
*  No, I like it.
*  I guess we might say hemorrhage, right?
*  Like it's, it's, okay.
*  So sleep comes in and prevents that from happening.
*  But with motor memories, it is enhancement.
*  It's that when you're awake across the day,
*  you don't get any worse,
*  which is what happens with fact textbook memory.
*  You hold that performance,
*  but then sleep comes in and it boosts you even further.
*  You get a nice benefit without doing anything further.
*  So then the question became to your point,
*  if sleep is doing that,
*  if it's not practice that makes perfect,
*  but practice with sleep, what is it about sleep?
*  So we looked at the sleep physiology,
*  and what we found were two interesting components.
*  First, it seemed to be related to that lighter form
*  of stage two non-REM sleep.
*  I told you that textbook memory
*  requires deep non-REM sleep stages three and four,
*  casting back to episode one.
*  Motor memory, more dependent on stage two,
*  and those beautiful spindles that are the hallmark
*  of beginning your stage two.
*  The more of those that you had,
*  the greater the memory benefit the next day.
*  We then wanted to say, well,
*  is this effect simply something to do with the night time?
*  Because that's the other hypothesis.
*  It's not really about sleep.
*  It's just something about night-time-ness,
*  because in all of the studies I've described so far,
*  they're all happening at night,
*  and at night they were sleeping.
*  So is it really night time, or is it specifically sleep?
*  So now we did a nap study with motor skill learning.
*  We repeated that, and sure enough,
*  even though that time period was across the day,
*  not during night-ness,
*  they showed this beautiful motor skill benefit
*  if they napped versus if they did not.
*  And then in that nap study,
*  I was telling you that they were learning the sequence
*  with the right non-dominant hand,
*  and they were all, we selected all right-handers
*  to make it equal.
*  And they were typing 41324, 41324.
*  And that right hand, as well you know,
*  is controlled by the left motor cortex.
*  So after the end of the nap study,
*  when we recorded their sleep,
*  we used very high-density EEG,
*  so lots and lots of sensors on top of the head,
*  so we could map with high fidelity resolution
*  the surface of the brain, or the surface of the scalp,
*  and infer what's going on in the brain.
*  And what was interesting is that,
*  yes, those sleep spindles,
*  the more of them that you had in the nap,
*  the better your motor skill learning was,
*  but there seemed to be a lateralized effect
*  such that the sleep spindle activity
*  on the right side of the brain,
*  which controls the left hand, which was not working,
*  that showed no spindle increase in activity.
*  However, on the right hand activity
*  that invoked activation in the left motor cortex,
*  that left motor cortex, and specifically the hand region,
*  showed a local increase in spindle activity.
*  And subsequent work and work prior to ours
*  had demonstrated that it's not sleep physiology globally.
*  It's almost as though your sleep physiology
*  responds to the mapping of the memory in the brain.
*  Wherever the memory is, that's where sleep,
*  when you go to sleep, sort of starts massaging the cortex
*  so that you get that plasticity.
*  It's almost like a good masseuse.
*  You know, you sort of sit down and they say,
*  where are your problem points?
*  And you say, it's here and here.
*  And so they don't give you a general massage.
*  They go to work on the regions that have been working
*  hardest that require greatest attention.
*  Sleep does that.
*  That's amazing and reminds me of some of this work
*  that was done, I think, in the late 90s, early 2000s,
*  Richard Morris and colleagues over in,
*  I think he was in Edinburgh,
*  talked about synaptic tagging.
*  You know, this notion that animals or humans perform
*  or learn some new motor skill,
*  maybe navigation of a novel environment,
*  maybe motor skill of the 41234 that you described,
*  you know, keys on a piano or something like that.
*  And then it was acknowledged that the changes
*  in the connections between neurons don't occur immediately,
*  which meant that there had to be some sort of tag
*  or label to the synapses that marked them
*  for consolidation later for plasticity,
*  long-term potentiation, things of that sort.
*  The names don't really matter.
*  I think later it became clear,
*  based on Marcus Frank's work and others,
*  that indeed during sleep,
*  the hard rewiring of the nervous system occurs,
*  plasticity occurs.
*  But what you're saying is that there's a high degree
*  of specificity, meaning the specific circuits
*  that were active and required for the learning
*  are the specific circuits that are modified,
*  which on the face of it, one could say, well, of course.
*  What that means is that during sleep,
*  the brain is somehow able to,
*  the neurons of the brain, that is,
*  are able to chemically or electrically or both signal,
*  like this is where there needs to be
*  some modifications done.
*  And then like a night crew,
*  the brain self-induces its own changes,
*  which is remarkable.
*  It really is.
*  It's almost as though there are red flags
*  that are planted in the territories
*  that have undergone learning dependent plasticity.
*  And they are calling out almost like hungry mouths
*  that are in plasticity famine
*  for the feast relief that comes by way of sleep.
*  Do we know what the factors are that are released in sleep
*  that allow that to occur?
*  Or is it, and I'm guessing there are many.
*  People love to talk about brain-derived
*  neurotrophic factor, BDNF,
*  which is a very interesting molecule,
*  is probably just one of a panoply of molecules
*  that are important.
*  We don't know necessarily the neurochemical processes,
*  although some people have manipulated plasticity
*  and then blocked it with different types of NMDA,
*  which is a certain type of receptor in the brain
*  for excitatory activity,
*  which is the underlying basis of brain plasticity.
*  So that certainly is dependent.
*  But what's interesting about the sleep spindles,
*  I said in the first episode that they burst
*  somewhere between about 12 to 15 times per second.
*  If you apply that type of stimulation
*  to a particular neuronal circuit within the brain,
*  that seems to be one of the, and it's not the only,
*  but one of the ideal sort of sweet spot tickling of neurons
*  that forces them to say,
*  oh, I think I should strengthen this circuit.
*  So it's almost as though these sleep spindles
*  are ideally designed at the frequency,
*  at the sort of tickling level of neurons
*  to stimulate exactly what we think is the underlying basis
*  of strengthening a memory,
*  which is at the level of the neurons,
*  the strengthening of synapses.
*  So interesting because we hear this fire together,
*  wire together, high frequency transmission between neurons
*  is what creates plasticity,
*  but this is literally a replay of previously,
*  meaning earlier that day or the previous day,
*  as you pointed out, activity in the given circuit
*  being replayed, not unlike the work that you talked about
*  earlier, the fast replay of neurons in the hippocampus.
*  But here it's not necessarily just in the hippocampus,
*  it can be in the neocortex or other structures
*  that then builds up the vigor with which that circuit
*  can function in the daytime, AKA learning.
*  It's super interesting.
*  You mentioned that this is occurring largely in stage two
*  of sleep, not in rapid eye movement sleep.
*  Is this business of stage two being the main period of sleep
*  in which motor learning occurs unique to motor learning?
*  In other words, cognitive information surely can get wired
*  into the brain at night, but is that largely associated
*  just with rapid eye movement sleep?
*  What this would suggest, in other words,
*  is that the earlier stages of sleep one and two
*  and heading into three and four serves a specific purpose,
*  which is consolidation of motor skills and motor learning
*  from the previous one or two days.
*  It does seem to be that stage two.
*  Stage one is, we now think of more of a transitional stage,
*  but we will speak perhaps when we discuss the idea
*  of creativity, that it also may have a memory function,
*  that very light first step of sleep.
*  Stage two is certainly related to motor skill.
*  In fact, stage two is fascinating.
*  We used to think of it as just the stage that you had
*  to go into to get to deep sleep and the stage that you had
*  to go back through to get up to REM sleep.
*  Never made any sense to me, why?
*  Because stage two non-REM sleep is about 40 to 50%
*  of your night.
*  Why would you spend 40 to 50% of your time asleep
*  when it's just simply a gate to get to something better?
*  You would spend more time in the something
*  that's better stages.
*  So we started to find functions, and stage two is distributed
*  throughout the night, but those sleep spindles in stage two
*  are not evenly distributed throughout the night.
*  You get some of them in the first quarter,
*  more of them in the second quarter of sleep.
*  Certainly more in the third quarter,
*  but you get a lot more of those sleep spindles
*  in the last quarter of the night.
*  And in fact, when we looked at the overnight study
*  where we had people learn in the evening,
*  tested the next day, we recorded their sleep in between.
*  Yes, sleep spindles predicted, and stage two predicted
*  how much better they were the next day,
*  but it was especially stage two in the last quarter
*  of the night, let's say I'm going to bed,
*  I'm just for argument's sake for ease,
*  midnight and I'm waking up at eight,
*  it's in that sort of six a.m. to eight a.m. range
*  when I, if I was going to sleep at that time,
*  would be getting my stage two.
*  And I find that interesting because it is the time of night
*  that we all feel it's okay to cut short,
*  to get a jumpstart on the day.
*  It's this modern life erosion of our sleep time.
*  And what these findings would suggest
*  is that you are shortchanging your brain
*  of some significant motor memory performance,
*  especially those classic Olympic coaches
*  that have the athletes training until eight in the evening.
*  And then they're in bed by sort of 10 or 11,
*  but they have them waking up at five
*  back on the athletic field at six.
*  But they would gain some additional motor memory benefit
*  if you just let them sleep a little bit longer.
*  I recall there was a study done at Stanford,
*  a relatively small study, but interesting nonetheless,
*  because I think it was the basketball team
*  that was asked to spend, I think,
*  an additional two hours in bed.
*  It's a sleep extension study.
*  And they were even told that they could do
*  other things in bed besides sleep.
*  There might have been some specifications of, you know,
*  things they should not do in bed during that time.
*  But at least by self-report,
*  some of the students said that they slept a bit more
*  or they relaxed a bit more in bed.
*  And indeed, when compared to the control group,
*  there was a significant improvement in their,
*  I forget if it was three throw, free throw percentage,
*  excuse me, or other metrics of basketball performance.
*  Yeah, it was the point scoring performance.
*  It was the speed up and down the court.
*  And it was a great study done by Sherry Ma
*  at Stanford University.
*  And she's done epic work with athletes
*  to sort of replicate those findings.
*  And the athlete story is interesting.
*  Some people may be saying, well,
*  didn't you just make a hop, skip, and a jump from,
*  you know, four, one, three, two, four
*  to inferring complex motor skill?
*  I thought about that.
*  So we did a new series of studies where we,
*  this is control.
*  That's the nice thing about the sort of typing on a sequence.
*  You can really measure that performance
*  with high sort of accuracy.
*  But we then switched it to a bi-manual task,
*  much more like learning to play a piano.
*  And you were learning sequences that were 12, 14 items
*  in length, and you had to learn them over and over.
*  And we had a hypothesis.
*  Would sleep fail at the task when motor skill performance
*  became much more complex, or would it be different?
*  And what we found was that the more and more complex
*  the motor skill became, the greater and the greater
*  the benefit of sleep by way of that consolidation effect.
*  And then I started to hear something,
*  because I would often be in the room
*  as these participants were learning the sequence.
*  And then as they were testing,
*  and my ears started to hear something
*  that I couldn't quite believe to begin with.
*  They would start to learn these motor sequences,
*  but they would seem to have these pauses,
*  and it's what we call chunking in motor skill memory.
*  So instead of four, one, three, two, four,
*  four, one, three, two, four, they would do four, one, three,
*  two, four, four, one, three, two, four.
*  And I would have them be using the same keyboard,
*  and I got to know the sound of the keyboard
*  and I could hear it, four, one, three, two, four,
*  four, one, three, two, four.
*  And then when they came back the next day,
*  yes, they were performing faster,
*  but they weren't just doing four, one, three, two, four,
*  four, one, three, two, four.
*  They were simply doing four, one, three, two, four,
*  four, one, three, two, four, four.
*  There was no gap at all.
*  So we went into the individual responses,
*  individual motor sort of finger responses.
*  And sure enough, before sleep,
*  there were these very clear problem points,
*  almost these pain points in the motor memory sequence.
*  But then when we came back after a night of sleep
*  and looked at their data,
*  it wasn't as though sleep simply grabbed
*  the motor skill memory sort of profile
*  and lifted everything up.
*  Sleep was selectively going after those pain points
*  and improving them.
*  And that to me was interesting
*  because that's the goal of a good athlete.
*  It is automaticity.
*  You don't want to be thinking about it.
*  At some point, you go from a very conscious act
*  of deliberately trying to remember what you should be doing
*  to then not thinking about it at all.
*  It's only automaticity that gives you that ability
*  not to think, and it operates below the level
*  of consciousness.
*  Super interesting.
*  And here we're talking about specific changes in the brain,
*  in terms of neural activity, et cetera,
*  that occur during sleep when we've been exposed to
*  or engaged in a particular novel for us, motor skill.
*  And you see these spindles in stage two, et cetera.
*  But does it work the other way as well?
*  Meaning, does the process of trying to learn
*  a new motor skill enhance certain components of sleep
*  or maybe even one's ability to sleep?
*  Years ago, I heard that
*  practicing unilateral leg movements,
*  this is perhaps a crazy idea, but it makes sense
*  in the context of what we're talking about.
*  Practicing unilateral leg movements,
*  things like, everyone's familiar with squats and deadlifts
*  and things of that sort,
*  but there are some one-legged movements.
*  Like a pistol squat.
*  I think a pistol squat, that's pretty hard.
*  If one can do them, I'm always impressed.
*  Bulgarian split squats, foot up on the bench
*  and then squatting down with a dumbbell, things like that.
*  Or just unilateral movements that require
*  a lot of mental attention to the performance
*  of that movement.
*  Could be in the gym, but it could be something else as well.
*  You think about a dancer trying to learn
*  how to organize their steps,
*  where they have to pay careful attention
*  to right versus left foot.
*  They always say, you know, like people have two right feet.
*  They can't dance, have two right feet or two left feet.
*  By the way, for those listening,
*  Andrew's looking at me right now
*  when he's saying two right feet.
*  No, no, no, no, no.
*  Rightfully so.
*  No, I have no knowledge of your dancing ability
*  or challenges.
*  Absence thereof.
*  Yeah.
*  As I recall, there may have been some very preliminary data
*  about changes in the amount of certain sleep stages
*  according to whether or not someone had tried
*  to learn a skill, in this case,
*  unilateral limb performance the previous day.
*  So in other words, if one wants to improve their sleep,
*  would the attempt to learn a new motor skill
*  be one avenue to improve one's sleep?
*  It's interesting.
*  If you look at some of the data,
*  it's a little bit mixed in terms of motor skill learning,
*  but there are some studies demonstrating
*  that it's true for textbook-like memory.
*  And there's a study, gosh, done many years ago,
*  again, by the great German group of Jan Born.
*  And they simply asked the question,
*  if you were to just not be learning very deliberately
*  and intensively through a textbook-like set of information,
*  and then we just measure your sleep to get a baseline,
*  and then we force you to have a very long,
*  very intensive learning session of these facts,
*  and then we measure your sleep again,
*  is there any difference relative to
*  the non-intensive learning day
*  versus the intensive learning day?
*  And indeed, what they found was that there was an increase
*  in their deep non-REM sleep, in their deep slow-wave sleep.
*  And again, we think it's almost,
*  we describe it as a homeostatic response,
*  which is just a fancy way of saying that
*  when the brain is driven to undergo a demand,
*  then sleep will respond to try to accommodate that demand.
*  And so I would say that there are probably many other things,
*  and we discussed this in episode two in terms of,
*  A, how to optimize your sleep,
*  that probably carry a bigger bang for your buck
*  in terms of optimizing and enhancing your sleep.
*  But is there any evidence to suggest that that's the case?
*  There does seem to be some evidence in the literature, yeah.
*  So interesting.
*  I certainly know the experience of trying to learn
*  a lot of information and then feeling like my sleep
*  is that much deeper, although I've also experienced
*  the challenges in, quote unquote, turning my brain off
*  when I've been trying to learn something
*  and then it's late in the evening.
*  Forget the caffeine component, you know,
*  just the information is spooling in my head,
*  maybe some pre-test anxiety, that kind of thing.
*  So I think that the tools and protocols that you offered
*  so generously in episodes one, two, and three
*  are especially important under those conditions,
*  learning how to really taper off one's level
*  of thinking and planning and arousal in the evening,
*  really bring things down so that one can access that sleep.
*  I mean, one only wishes that the more we did during the day,
*  the easier it would be to sleep.
*  I think to some extent that's true,
*  but there's some conditions in which doing more,
*  thinking about more, and I guess that's sort of the irony,
*  right, I interrupted myself, but on purpose,
*  that wouldn't it be wonderful if the amount
*  and ease of sleep was directly proportional
*  to how much we needed to sleep?
*  That's one of the tricks in this whole business.
*  The fickle system sometimes.
*  Right, like sometimes when we really need sleep,
*  we're dealing with something psychologically challenging
*  or we need to learn something, we have an exam,
*  that often can be when it's most difficult to sleep.
*  Gets right in the way of what we need most.
*  Although coming back to your point,
*  I think physical activity does seem to be
*  one of those things that is very good,
*  and I'm remiss to have not included it in the optimization
*  or the unconventional tips.
*  There is a very good robust literature now
*  demonstrating that if you are physically active
*  during the day, you can boost the quality of your sleep,
*  particularly your deep sleep at night.
*  It seems to be, there are some subtle differences
*  in terms of whether you're doing aerobic versus anaerobic,
*  so let's say versus doing a spin bike class for an hour
*  versus lifting resistance, or doing resistance training
*  for an hour or strength training.
*  There's subtle differences, but net that overall,
*  the big picture view is that when you perform exercise,
*  you drive a response from enhanced sleep,
*  particularly deep sleep at night,
*  and I think many people have had that experience.
*  You've been out on a long hike, maybe a 10, 12-mile hike,
*  or you've just been working in the garden,
*  doing really sort of long landscaping work
*  throughout the day, six or seven hours,
*  and you just come in and you go to bed that night,
*  and you just know that this is going to be
*  the most royal night of sleep that you could,
*  you know it ahead of time, sort of ear hole to elbow,
*  and that evidence is now very clear.
*  The one interesting thing, if you dig into that data though,
*  you can drive increases in deep sleep by way of exercise.
*  It does seem to come at a little bit of cost to REM sleep.
*  Exercise may throttle back some of your REM sleep.
*  Now, don't fear that.
*  It may just simply be that every night, and we know this,
*  my sleep and my stages of sleep are going to be
*  much different to yours in how they are structured
*  and how they play out, but even within me,
*  the same individual, Matt, my sleep stages vary
*  from one night to the next to the next.
*  Some of that is idiosyncratic.
*  Others, or other reasons, depend on what I've been doing
*  during the day, and so it may be that we don't need
*  to get concerned about that modest reduction in REM
*  due to exercise-enhanced non-REM,
*  because it's simply that when you've gone through
*  that form of activity as a human being during the day,
*  what you need is that type of sleep
*  more so than perhaps REM sleep,
*  and therefore the next night, things calibrate back down.
*  Let's say I wasn't as active,
*  I just sort of went to work during the day,
*  and I'm back to baseline again.
*  So I don't get too concerned about that,
*  but I just want to bring it up.
*  It's there in the literature.
*  Yeah, I think it's a very interesting point,
*  and one just has to trust that nature knows best
*  in modifying the percentage of different sleep stages
*  according to our daytime activity.
*  Again, highlighting the key relationship,
*  the closely tethered relationship
*  between daytime activity and sleep, and vice versa.
*  Correct, yeah, and it's a reciprocal loop,
*  because what we found is that exercise during the day
*  can enhance sleep at night,
*  but also what we found is that sleep at night
*  enhances your athletic performance the following day,
*  and I'm not just talking about motor skill,
*  memory upstairs in the brain.
*  I'm talking about physical activity in the body,
*  and if you limit sleep to let's say less than six hours,
*  the data demonstrates that your peak muscle performance
*  is decreased, your peak vertical jump height decreases,
*  your time to exhaustion decreases.
*  In some studies, it was up to 30%,
*  so if you're training for a 10K marathon,
*  but you don't get enough sleep the night before,
*  you're done by seven.
*  We also know that it decreases perhaps more than almost
*  any of those, and it's striking the brain's motivation
*  to exercise at all.
*  So in fact, many people may be able to get close
*  to their peak muscle strength when they are under slept.
*  Chances are they're probably never going to get
*  to the chance to express that,
*  because their motivation to exercise just drops off,
*  and I think many people will resonate
*  that you had a bad night of sleep,
*  I just don't want to go to the gym the next day.
*  The final part of that is injury risk.
*  There is a significantly elevated injury risk,
*  and if you ask most athletes,
*  okay, what am I particularly concerned about?
*  Is it my performance, or if I had some kind of injury,
*  that knocks me out for the rest of the season?
*  And so I've had the fortunate chance to work
*  with many professional teams of different kinds,
*  and gradually they are realizing what I sort of long said,
*  and it's a crass statement,
*  but I think sleep is probably the greatest
*  legal performance enhancing drug
*  that most athletes are not abusing enough.
*  I could not agree more.
*  I mean, I feel like every time I say sleep
*  is the bedrock of mental health,
*  physical health, and performance,
*  it's sometimes perceived as just kind of like,
*  oh yeah, sleep, we need to sleep,
*  but there's no question that the positive effects
*  of getting excellent sleep on a consistent basis,
*  far outweigh and perform any kind of supplement
*  or even performance enhancing drug.
*  In fact, those most supplements
*  and performance enhancing drugs
*  that can indeed improve performance of various kinds
*  seem to only function or function best,
*  certainly on a backdrop of excellent sleep.
*  And I should say that I think you've done a brilliant job
*  of being very explicit about the fact
*  that you need to get all of the basics in place,
*  and then it's great to think about fine tweaking
*  with optimization of things like supplementation
*  and all of these other things.
*  And I think sometimes that message has been
*  maybe a little bit more mixed
*  in the social media environment
*  that we often don't think about the basics,
*  and we go straight to supplementation
*  where you would say, gosh,
*  there's actually a log order of magnitude benefit
*  that's on the table if only you had to do
*  some of the basic things that your grandmother
*  would probably tell you.
*  Eat right, get your stress sorted out,
*  do some physical activity,
*  and make sure that you get some sleep.
*  Do those things and you're very far along.
*  Now there's more opportunity on the table
*  for fine tuning as you've elegantly discussed.
*  But I think I just want to acknowledge
*  that I think you've done a really great job
*  of being balanced in that message.
*  And I hope people in the general sphere
*  can appreciate how hard that is to do.
*  It's not an easy thing
*  when you are talking about supplementation
*  At first it sounds as though,
*  gosh, all of this speak and you describe great data
*  means that it is the holy grail of enhanced human beings.
*  But you're always careful to say this after the foundation.
*  And I can give a very good example with sleep.
*  Let's say that you're trying to manage your weight
*  and lose weight and you're dieting,
*  but you're not getting sufficient sleep.
*  What we've discovered is that yes, you will lose weight
*  when you're dieting,
*  even though you're not getting enough sleep.
*  The problem is that almost 60% of the weight that you lose
*  will come from lean muscle mass and not fat.
*  In other words, when you are under slapped and dieting,
*  you keep what you're trying to lose, which is the fat,
*  and you lose what you wish to keep, which is the muscle.
*  So your body does something very interesting
*  in its removal of different types of energy stores
*  in your body when you are not slept.
*  It becomes very stingy with fat and it will not give it up
*  when you are sleep deprived, which is very interesting.
*  Why would that be, by the way?
*  Muscles such as metabolically demanding tissue,
*  you know, by not sleeping well, you're sending signals
*  that there really isn't the capacity to take care
*  of what you already have,
*  much less increase the size of the engine.
*  That's exactly right.
*  And then think about fat, which is in terms of its energy,
*  you know, unit benefit, it has, you know,
*  at least perhaps twice the caloric value that protein does.
*  So if you are under slapped, that is a warning sign
*  to any evolutionary species past that things are dire.
*  So whatever I'm going to do, this is break glass
*  in case of emergency situation.
*  And if you're not getting enough calories,
*  I'm gonna hold onto the thing
*  that has the highest caloric value right until the end,
*  which is fat, and I'm going to give away the stuff
*  that doesn't have as much caloric benefit
*  because I am in a caloric deficit right now.
*  Now, of course, that's strange
*  because the person trying to lose weight perhaps
*  is rightfully trying to lose weight
*  based on them being somewhat overweight.
*  But that's the biology that we think explains
*  why that that's the case.
*  It's not just a strange phenomenon,
*  it's a very logical one.
*  Yeah, it is a logical one.
*  And thanks for the support around, you know,
*  my constant voicing and revoicing of the pillars
*  of healthy you mentioned, you know, exercise, well,
*  I put in the order of sleep as the most important pillar.
*  And then one could argue about the order of the others,
*  but in no specific order, light, which dovetails with sleep,
*  but nutrition, movement, exercise,
*  social connection, stress modulation,
*  these kinds of things.
*  Yeah, the fact that the speed with which
*  that comes out of your mouth tells you
*  how many times you've said it,
*  and you've said it over and over.
*  It's wonderful.
*  Well, thank you.
*  It's interesting because they are the basics,
*  but they are basics that need to be re-upped every 24 hours.
*  And so often I feel like we all need to be reminded
*  every 24 hours.
*  I also, you know, one of the most common questions I get
*  is what should I take?
*  People like if I had a dollar for every time somebody said,
*  what should I take?
*  You know, I'd keep podcasting, but I'd be a gazillionaire.
*  But my response is always the same,
*  which is how's your sleep?
*  The first question I say is how's your sleep?
*  And then they think I'm gonna suggest a sleep supplement,
*  but I wanna know whether or not people are sleeping well
*  on a consistent basis.
*  And that opens up a whole set of discussions,
*  and then inevitably we forget about
*  what one should take conversation.
*  I think it's the rare individual who's sleeping very well
*  every night of their life.
*  There are such individuals.
*  And then the what should I take conversation
*  makes sense in a certain context.
*  There's something I wanted to just return to
*  for a moment before I move on to the next topic,
*  which is you mentioned all the significant deficits
*  that occur in motor performance
*  when one has not slept that well the night before.
*  Grip strength, vertical jump, motivation, et cetera.
*  You know, we're not here to deliver anything
*  except the facts to people.
*  We're certainly not here to soften the blow of reality.
*  But there are a good number of people
*  that will have say a physical performance, like a race.
*  They're training for a half marathon,
*  or they have a big game the next day,
*  or they have some performance event the next day.
*  And by virtue of butterflies, anxiety, travel,
*  an alarm going off in a hotel in the middle of the night,
*  I've had that experience, et cetera,
*  that they may not get the best night's sleep.
*  And obviously, there are going to be ramifications of that.
*  But I'm reminded of a study that was done
*  by Ali Krum's lab at Stanford,
*  where people wear sleep trackers.
*  And they actually knew how much
*  and how well or poorly they slept the night before.
*  I don't know how detailed the analysis was,
*  but it was Stanford Sleep Center,
*  so presumably it was reasonably detailed.
*  And then the next day, with that knowledge in hand,
*  either lied to the people or told them the truth
*  about how well they had slept the night before or poorly.
*  For instance, if someone had got eight hours
*  of great sleep the night before,
*  they might have told them,
*  hey, you got eight hours of great sleep the night before.
*  Or they might have been in a condition where they said,
*  hey, you know what, your sleep last night wasn't that great.
*  Or if somebody got five hours of sleep,
*  they might have said, hey, you know,
*  you got eight hours of great sleep.
*  So there was a lot of lying involved in this study.
*  But basically what they observed is that performance,
*  I think it was motor skill performance,
*  but it might have been cognitive,
*  but that's not the issue here.
*  The point is that much of our performance
*  can be dependent on our subjective understanding
*  of how well or poorly we slept the night before.
*  In other words, there can be belief effects.
*  So this is one of the concerns
*  about placing too much emphasis on the one poor night sleep.
*  And obviously people should be mindful of injury,
*  as you pointed out.
*  But if someone has a big race or a big event the next day
*  and they just don't sleep well,
*  I think that we have to be careful
*  that the mere knowledge
*  that they're not gonna perform as well,
*  because that's what the data say,
*  can potentially be offset by the Allie Crumb study,
*  which is if they believe like,
*  hey, a lot of it is about what they believe
*  about their own sleep to be,
*  which just tells you that performance can,
*  and motivation presumably,
*  can override some of the physiology.
*  There's a, you know, and again,
*  you can't rescue what you can't rescue.
*  No, and I think it's a very good point
*  because it comes back to our discussion
*  about the placebo effect in some ways,
*  which is this is mind over matter
*  and that your biological state.
*  So one of the things I do
*  when I'm working with professional athletes
*  and we're doing sleep tracking,
*  often I'm working with a coach
*  and I will say during that period where they're really,
*  you know, it's sort of that they're on the road
*  and now it's they've got seven games to play
*  in the playoffs, let's keep tracking their sleep
*  and let's you and I make sure
*  that we're trying to optimize this athlete,
*  because they've given consent,
*  they want to have their sleep as good as possible
*  and they want us to help them do that.
*  But I say at that point,
*  we will simply look at the data night after night
*  and then we can describe the data
*  that they've been having at the end of the week
*  after they finished the series.
*  Because for exactly that reason,
*  if you start giving them feedback,
*  we don't want to erode confidence.
*  And with sleep trackers,
*  there is such a thing called orthosomnia
*  and it's now a described situation.
*  Orthosomnia in medicine words mean something.
*  So ortho people will be familiar with in medicine,
*  orthopedics, orthodontics,
*  it's about getting things straight,
*  orthopedics getting your sort of bone straight,
*  orthodontics getting your teeth straight.
*  Orthosomnia is about trying to get your sleep straight
*  and being so worried about that,
*  that it compromises your sleep.
*  Now we don't know exactly what proportion of people,
*  it may be less than 10% who use sleep trackers,
*  but I would say that to anyone listening,
*  if you are tracking your sleep with a tracker
*  and you're experiencing this sleep related anxiety,
*  do one of two things.
*  First, take my recommendation,
*  which is that only on let's say a Sunday afternoon,
*  do you open up the app and check your data.
*  So that way you can still be measuring your sleep,
*  which is very helpful,
*  but you don't have to get the anxiety morning after morning.
*  The other is that if you are truly starting
*  to get a very negative experience,
*  take it off, put it in the drawer
*  and just get your sleep confidence back
*  using some of the suggestions that we had
*  in the optimization episode.
*  And only then return to using that tracker.
*  What's also interesting,
*  it relates to what you were saying about beliefs
*  and intention, they did another great study
*  where they looked at this cortisol rise in the morning
*  that you and I have discussed on this series many times,
*  which starts to happen sort of just before you're waking up
*  and really rises into the morning.
*  What they did was they brought participants
*  into the laboratory and they had them go to sleep
*  at around 11 o'clock at night.
*  And then in one group, they said,
*  we're going to wake you up at 7 a.m. in the morning.
*  The other group, they said,
*  we're going to wake you up at 5 a.m. in the morning.
*  Well, it turns out that both of those groups
*  were woken up at 7 a.m.
*  But what was bizarre is that in the group that was told
*  they were going to wake up at 5 a.m.,
*  their cortisol release started to rise around 5 a.m.
*  In other words, just the knowledge before sleep
*  that you're going to be woken up at 5 a.m.
*  changed the non-conscious brain's release
*  of a stock standard prototypical hormonal release mechanism.
*  And that comes right back to this idea
*  that we were speaking about with time,
*  that consciously we have lost time perception
*  when we're sleeping, but non-consciously,
*  it seems as though the brain is still knowing
*  what's going on because for that early morning flight,
*  you wake up two minutes before your alarm.
*  Well, perhaps the reason why is that you've learned
*  that you have to wake up at that time
*  and you've changed your cortisol response,
*  which would normally, because you don't wake up
*  for an early morning flight every day,
*  would normally not come for two hours,
*  but it's arriving earlier.
*  It just blew me away.
*  I couldn't believe that the brain non-consciously
*  could change a hormonal profile simply based on me telling you
*  what time you're going to wake up the next morning.
*  Spectacular.
*  And really, as you pointed out,
*  really speaks to the fact that during sleep,
*  there is a lot of processing going on,
*  you know, subconscious, unconscious, cognitive processing.
*  And we know this in the form of dreams,
*  a topic that we'll talk about
*  in a subsequent episode of this series.
*  But okay, so you've shared with us the clear value
*  of getting the best possible night's sleep
*  before what I call a bout of learning.
*  Yeah.
*  You also shared with us the clear value of getting sleep
*  after being exposed to some new information,
*  aka a bout of learning.
*  And you've explained to us the key relationship
*  between sleep and motor learning,
*  learning of new motor skills.
*  What are some other aspects of brain and cognition
*  for which sleep exerts a significant positive effect?
*  So those, for a while, were the first two things
*  that we really thought sleep was doing
*  for learning and memory.
*  Sleep before learning to make those memories,
*  sleep after learning to consolidate them
*  and hit the save button.
*  But then data started to emerge
*  and we started to look at this too,
*  that sleep was much more intelligent
*  than we ever imagined
*  when it comes to information processing.
*  Sleep doesn't simply just strengthen individual memories
*  like isolate islands, unconnected.
*  Sleep after learning is almost a form
*  of informational alchemy.
*  That sleep will take these new memories
*  and it will start to interconnect them
*  and cross-link them with the new information
*  that you've learned,
*  because usually information that you're learning
*  during the day is interconnected.
*  And sleep was building those connections
*  between new memories.
*  But also it was integrating them into the back catalog
*  of all of your past autobiographical memory systems
*  so that you woke up the next day
*  and you had a revised mind-wide web of associations.
*  And a good example of this,
*  we did a study, gosh, very early on,
*  where we asked the question,
*  which stage of sleep then is important for this type of,
*  I almost think of it as a bit of a strange analogy,
*  but almost like group therapy for memories,
*  that at the end of the day,
*  every new memory gets a name badge
*  and sleep gathers in all of these memories
*  into the same room.
*  And it forces you, however, to speak to the people,
*  not at the front of the room
*  that you think you've got the most obvious connection with.
*  It forces you to speak to the people
*  all the way at the back of the room
*  that you don't think you've got really
*  any connection with at all.
*  But it turns out that you do,
*  because sleep doesn't simply build associations
*  and connections, it does.
*  It seems to bias the brain
*  towards building the most non-obvious distant associations.
*  It's almost like a Google search gone wrong,
*  that during the waking day, our memories,
*  which our brains are still associative
*  in how they can build links and connections,
*  that's like page one of the Google search.
*  So let's say that I type in Andrew Huberman,
*  and the first page I get,
*  the first hit is the Huberman Lab website, great.
*  But if I go to page 20,
*  it's about a field hockey game in Utah.
*  And I think, heck, in a second, what's Andrew doing?
*  You didn't know?
*  But yeah, I know exactly.
*  The only thing I've ever played field hockey,
*  I've been to Utah, it's a beautiful state.
*  Oh, it's beautiful.
*  But if I look, I can actually see
*  that there is a very distant non-obvious association.
*  I can understand why it's there.
*  That's what sleep seems to be over-indexing for
*  in this associational framework.
*  So then we ask, well, what is it about sleep?
*  So we had participants perform anagram solving tasks.
*  And anagrams are simply these words that are,
*  the letters are all jumbled up,
*  and you have to kind of stare at them or work through them.
*  And all of a sudden, you start to see which word it really is
*  because at first it's all jumbled up and it makes no sense.
*  But we didn't teach them it before sleep and after sleep.
*  We did something different.
*  We woke them up out of different stages of sleep.
*  Why?
*  Well, when you come out of different stages of sleep,
*  there is still some degree of the biology
*  of that sleep state that lingers in your brain,
*  almost like vapors coming off the stage of sleep
*  that you've just exited.
*  And it only lasts for about two minutes or so.
*  But what was nice is that this anagram test
*  you could do within two minutes.
*  So we would wake them up out of different stages of sleep,
*  and then we'd have them quickly do these anagrams.
*  And I told you that for fact-based memory,
*  that sleep after learning was important
*  to strengthen the individual memories.
*  And it was particularly non-rapid eye movement sleep
*  that was doing that strengthening of the individual facts.
*  Now what we found is that the association
*  creativity benefit of sleep was very different.
*  That cross-linking benefit came by way,
*  it seemed, of REM sleep.
*  Because when we woke them up out of REM sleep
*  compared to non-REM sleep,
*  they were 30% more capable of solving these anagrams.
*  And when we looked at how they were solving them,
*  it was interesting.
*  Coming out of non-REM sleep, it was very sort of analogical.
*  It was very, what we think of as very sort of convergent,
*  very focused way of trying to logically solve the problem.
*  But with REM sleep,
*  it was much more divergent fluid intelligence.
*  It was almost as though they were just standing back
*  and waiting for it and then it just popped out
*  in front of them.
*  All the letters kind of reorganized
*  and clicked into place.
*  And then there was a subsequent study
*  that did something different.
*  It looked specifically at creative insight.
*  And it was a lovely study
*  and they performed something
*  called the numeric number reduction test,
*  which is one of those tests
*  that psychologists love to administer
*  and participants hate to perform.
*  And here's what happens.
*  You're shown a whole string of numbers
*  and you are given a certain set of rules
*  and you have to work through those number problems
*  and come out with a final end answer.
*  And you're told that you're going to be judged simply
*  on how many correct final end answers that you get.
*  And you work through hundreds of these problems.
*  What they don't tell you in the instructions, however,
*  is that there is a hidden rule here
*  embedded in that all of those sequences,
*  all of the sequences are different that you have to solve,
*  but there is one common rule that binds them all together,
*  which is that the second part,
*  sort of the second component of the solution.
*  So you're working through,
*  let's say it's a 10 digit string number
*  and you have to apply these rules, the first number,
*  then carry it through to the second number
*  and then to the third number.
*  The second partial number that you produce
*  in this string of calculations
*  to get to the final end answer,
*  it turns out to be always the same end answer.
*  So in other words, if you clue on to this hidden rule,
*  all you have to do is work up to the first,
*  let's say 10% of every problem,
*  you can just shortcut the rest of it
*  and you just write down the number
*  because you are told that the only thing
*  we're going to judge you on is the end answer.
*  So they train participants on these sort of numeric number reduction trials
*  and then they brought them back after 12 hours of being awake
*  and no one seemed to have that light bulb moment of the sort of,
*  okay, I get it.
*  But then they did the same thing, they trained them,
*  but now they train them in the evening,
*  they gave them a full eight hours of sleep,
*  they came back the next morning
*  and there was a three-fold increase
*  in creative insight problem solving ability.
*  In other words, people were coming back with that aha moment of,
*  you know, the gig is up, I've got it,
*  I know what you guys are trying to do and I'm going to show you.
*  Then they did something clever,
*  they said back to our question of motor skill learning,
*  well, is that really sleep or is it just circadian,
*  that it's just something about going through the night
*  that gives you this kind of do-lally creative benefit.
*  So they took another group,
*  they taught them the information in the evening
*  and they tested them the next morning just like the sleep group,
*  but they kept them up all night.
*  So they went through night time nurse for that time period
*  and they showed no benefit in the problem solving.
*  Yeah, my experience is that sleep deprivation
*  leads to all sorts of ideas about how one is coming up
*  with novel ideas and solutions,
*  all of which completely suck after two good nights sleep.
*  But most of the time it seems that sleep deprivation,
*  intoxication of any kind,
*  it gives one the impression that, you know,
*  you're coming up with novel solutions,
*  but really they're just novel.
*  Yeah, that data is very clear that, you know,
*  there's this misnomer that if I sort of go through the night
*  and work through into the morning,
*  I'm just much more creative when I'm sleep deprived
*  and it's been tested and it's just, it's the opposite,
*  quite the opposite in fact.
*  What I also find interesting though
*  about this sleep and creativity lock,
*  it was always there in the literature
*  that there are innumerable anecdotes
*  of people having sleep inspired insight.
*  It's almost as though when you wake up the next morning,
*  having had that revised set of web connections in your brain,
*  you can divine solutions
*  to previously impenetrable problems.
*  And there's a great example, I think,
*  Dmitri Mendeleev, who at the time was trying to answer
*  one of the most epic questions in human history.
*  How do all of the known elements in the universe
*  fit together in some logical order?
*  And he was failing, he just could not,
*  and he was so obsessed with this problem,
*  he created playing cards with all of the different elements
*  of the universe and their atomic weights and their electron.
*  And he would go on these long train rides
*  and he would just shuffle the cards
*  and he would deal the cards on the table.
*  He was just desperate to try to see what the pattern was,
*  shuffling and shuffling and shuffling.
*  And then the story goes and it's written that
*  one night he fell asleep and he dreamt
*  and he could start to see all of the cards
*  just dancing around in front of his eyes
*  and then they snapped together in this logical grid
*  based on the atomic weight
*  and the different electron properties.
*  And he wrote it down on the back of an envelope
*  which still exists to this date.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, and you can see it.
*  And that was the initial basis
*  for what we call the periodic table of elements.
*  Amazing.
*  And it revolutionized human history.
*  And it's not just in science.
*  I mean, there's great scientific,
*  people have won Nobel prizes
*  for understanding your old transmission, Otto Lowey.
*  Well, and maybe it's worth rattling off
*  a few brief examples because they're so spectacular.
*  Einstein was known for taking naps in the middle of the day
*  multiple times throughout the day
*  in order to come up with novel solutions.
*  I think the discovery of some of the organic,
*  The benzene ring?
*  The benzene ring came to, I'm forgetting.
*  Ogas Kekulay.
*  In a dream, thank you.
*  There are numerous examples
*  of fundamental scientific discoveries
*  that is creative insights
*  that were anchored to real world experiments
*  and theory, pure theory as well,
*  that came to people in their dreams.
*  So what's interesting though
*  is that there seems to be some sort of hydraulic pressure
*  created by the waking or within wakefulness attempt
*  to like figure something out.
*  So all of these people, to be very clear,
*  didn't just sleep to come up with solutions.
*  They put a lot of hydraulic pressure
*  feeding a lot of information,
*  thinking about a problem in a structured
*  or unstructured way, taking walks,
*  focusing on their other demands of the day.
*  But then when they went to sleep,
*  clearly that information was still being worked with
*  in important ways.
*  And then you were going to mention some examples
*  from the arts, I think.
*  Yeah, there's some great, you know,
*  I was born and raised in Liverpool, in England,
*  and of course, famous for The Beatles
*  and for Liverpool Football Club,
*  and Everton as well, but I'm a Liverpool supporter.
*  However, Paul McCartney has gone on record very clearly
*  to say that two songs that were probably
*  some of the most successful songs,
*  Yesterday and Let It Be,
*  both came to him by way of dream-inspired insight.
*  There's a lovely description, I think, in his biography.
*  He was filming, it was either help
*  or a hard day's night down in London
*  with the rest of The Beatles,
*  and he was staying in a rental in Wimpole Street in London,
*  and he was staying on the third floor,
*  and in his bedroom, fortunately,
*  there was a piano on the opposite side of the room.
*  And he describes how he woke up one morning
*  with this beautiful melody by way of,
*  it was a string quartet that was playing it,
*  and it was the melody for Yesterday,
*  and he went straight over to the piano
*  and he started playing it,
*  and he said it was just so sumptuous,
*  and he couldn't remember where he had heard it.
*  And then after a while, he remembered,
*  I haven't heard it anywhere before.
*  It came to me by way of sleep.
*  Same thing with Let It Be.
*  Obviously, Mother Mary comes to me singing songs
*  or singing words of wisdom, Let It Be.
*  And there's often been a suggestion
*  that that has religious overtones in terms of Mother Mary.
*  It actually is not.
*  It's his mother, Mary McCartney.
*  And he was having a hard time struggling
*  with the fame of The Beatles at that moment,
*  and one night he slept and his mother, Mary,
*  came to him and just said, relax, it's going to be okay.
*  Stay true to yourself, continue doing what you're doing.
*  Just let it be.
*  And he woke up and he wrote the song.
*  I love that story.
*  And there's some actionable takeaways here
*  that if I may, I just wanted to mention.
*  A previous guest on this episode,
*  in fact, he's been on the podcast twice,
*  is the great Rick Rubin.
*  I've listened to those.
*  Yeah, one of the most legendary music producers of all time.
*  And the second episode that we did with Rick,
*  he gets heavily into some of his protocols,
*  for lack of a better way to describe them.
*  And one of the things that Rick does
*  is when he wakes up in the morning,
*  he makes it a point to, he takes walks, he gets sunshine,
*  he hydrates, he does all of those things.
*  But to try and make the transition between sleep
*  and wakefulness to be rather gradual,
*  almost to allow some of the components of sleep
*  to bleed into the morning
*  and then allow wakefulness to come about.
*  And in his case, he's able to push
*  some of the more linear processing and procedural things
*  to later in the day.
*  And I've spent a lot of time with Rick.
*  I'm fortunate to be close friends with Rick.
*  And I can tell you that he also spends a fair amount of time
*  sitting or lying down typically very still
*  with his eyes closed, just thinking
*  or allowing thoughts to emerge
*  as part of his creative process.
*  Now, he's certainly not the only one to do this,
*  but he's a notable example.
*  But what's the takeaway here?
*  Should everyone be lying with their eyes closed
*  when they first wake up?
*  Perhaps, but there's some potential do's.
*  But I think there's a really strong don't.
*  If one subscribes to the idea that during sleep,
*  there is substantial reorganization of neural circuitry,
*  AKA learning, but also expansion of creative opportunity,
*  as you've clearly pointed out,
*  and there are data to support that statement,
*  then it stands to reason that upon waking,
*  there's a key opportunity to capture some of that
*  information that is now in your mind
*  that was created the night before,
*  but that if you immediately look at your phone,
*  that you eclipse that process with sensory input
*  from somebody else's ideas and what's going on in the world.
*  And it's not to say that looking at your phone
*  first thing in the morning is a cardinal sin
*  or a violation of any kind of neural circuit requirement,
*  but I, in an attempt to try and capture some of the learning
*  and creativity that occurs during sleep,
*  have tried for a while now to not look at my phone
*  for at least the first 30 minutes after waking.
*  It's very challenging to do for most everybody,
*  but rather to let some of the ideas from sleep percolate up,
*  and I will often go, you know,
*  be making a morning cup of tea or something,
*  and then go running to my office to write something down
*  that suddenly springs to mind,
*  and then I'll remember that this was something
*  that came to me in a dream the night before,
*  none of which is significant as the benzene ring
*  or the periodic table or the kind of works
*  that Rick has produced,
*  but I think that we need to be cautious
*  about not short-circuiting these creative insights
*  that no doubt can come to us in sleep.
*  I think it's very well worth just,
*  even for your own mental health,
*  firstly, not to just wake up
*  and start your reception of the world,
*  but to do some, as we've mentioned, reflection
*  on what you've just experienced by way of sleeping,
*  and it doesn't necessarily have to be
*  that you're trying to recall your dreams.
*  Just sit with whatever your thoughts are.
*  Think about the day ahead, think about the days prior,
*  and there is some benefit,
*  and the creative benefit there,
*  and you mentioned Einstein.
*  Another one that is often mentioned to me is Edison,
*  Thomas Edison, the inventor,
*  and Edison was claimed to be a short sleeper.
*  People will say, well, he was a brilliant inventor,
*  but he said that he didn't sleep very much.
*  Turns out that Edison was a habitual napper during the day,
*  and I've got lots of pictures of him napping
*  on his workbench in his studio, him napping in the garden.
*  Well, I took a 45-minute nap today.
*  Yeah, and it was, he, and-
*  And I'm no Edison, but I subscribe to his protocols.
*  But, you know, he understood the creative brilliance
*  of sleep, to your point, about writing things down,
*  and he used it ruthlessly as a tool,
*  and here's what he would do, it's genius.
*  He would take a pair of steel ball bearings
*  in his right hand, and he would sit in his office
*  on a reclining chair with a rest for his arm,
*  and then he would put a pad of paper and a pen next to him,
*  and then he would gradually start to relax off,
*  but what he'd done was he used a metal saucepan
*  and turned it upside down and placed it
*  underneath the armrest, and as he was drifting off
*  into that state, into that sort of liminal state,
*  so he didn't go too far into sleep,
*  what would happen is that his muscle tone
*  would gradually relax, he would release
*  the steel ball bearings, they would crash on the saucepan,
*  wake him up, and then he would start to write down
*  all of the ideas that he was having
*  from that liminal state.
*  Oh, you said saucepan.
*  Saucepan, sorry.
*  No, no, that's okay, but.
*  Bad accent.
*  So it made a clanging sound.
*  A metal saucepan underneath, or a water pail,
*  whatever it was, and it would crash that, wake him up,
*  and then he would write down these ideas.
*  So interesting.
*  And in fact, if you look at his house,
*  which is preserved, historical, you can walk around,
*  and he had nap cots installed in his house
*  so he could go into different rooms
*  and take naps in these little cots for his genius.
*  Brilliant, isn't it?
*  It is brilliant, sorry I didn't mean to interrupt,
*  but it was out of enthusiasm.
*  I mean, I don't want to give too much detailed information
*  about Rick's working environment, but yeah,
*  let's just say there are a lot of places to lie down
*  and access these states of mind.
*  And it looks like somebody just lying there
*  with their eyes closed,
*  but there's an extremely active mind in there.
*  Obviously, look at the productive output
*  of Rick's career, it's truly something to behold,
*  behold in capital, bold, underlined, highlighted letters.
*  But it's so clear to me, based on all the examples
*  you gave, the ones that we're kind of batting
*  back and forth now, and I think there's a book,
*  the title is something like Winston Churchill's Nap,
*  or something like that, that my dad is always talking,
*  my dad's a theoretical physicist,
*  he's always talking about napping is so key
*  to one's ability to come up with novel solutions.
*  You know, I guess that napping frequently
*  throughout the day perhaps violates some of the tenets
*  that you described in the episode on napping in caffeine,
*  episode three.
*  I think you agree, because we put in guardrails,
*  and we put in the protocols to say, okay,
*  naps under certain circumstances are no bad thing at all,
*  and if you're going to do it,
*  here are the suggested guidelines as to exactly
*  how you optimize naps with a protocol.
*  But it is, I think it's very worthwhile
*  to just appreciate exactly how complex sleep is
*  in terms of what it's doing for information processing.
*  And if you were to ask me, look, what's the take home
*  of this final section?
*  I think it's, no one has ever told you,
*  Andrew, you really need to stay awake on a problem.
*  They've told you that you should sleep.
*  Now many times.
*  On a problem.
*  Go to sleep.
*  Yeah, sleep on a problem.
*  And what's interesting is that in every language
*  that I've been quiet about today,
*  from English to Swahili,
*  that phrase, sleeping on a problem,
*  or something like it, very much exists.
*  I think the Spanish someone was telling me is,
*  it translated as you have a conversation with your pillow,
*  which I thought was lovely.
*  What I also was struck by a fellow who was French said,
*  you in England, you say you sleep on a problem.
*  Well, the French translation is much closer to you
*  sleep with a problem.
*  And I thought that's so much about the romantic difference
*  between the beautiful French and the English.
*  You sleep on a problem versus you sleep with a problem.
*  Yes, I agree.
*  I think not only does it have more romantic notions,
*  but I like it because there's a symbiotic aspect
*  to sleeping with the problem.
*  There's kind of a meshing with the challenge
*  in a way that isn't as combative.
*  Like this thing that's weighing on you,
*  you go to sleep with it,
*  and you're supposed to wake up and feel like you solved it.
*  Like Eureka, right?
*  Push down on it rather than it's a collaboration with sleep
*  rather than a demand from it.
*  But I also think it's,
*  I make that notion about language translation
*  and maybe a slight joke,
*  but what it also tells me is this,
*  that that phenomenon of sleep dependent creativity
*  transcends cultural boundaries.
*  It is common across the globe.
*  It's a universal phenomenon.
*  Why?
*  Well, because sleep is a universal phenomenon,
*  not just even in humans,
*  but in almost every species
*  that we've studied carefully today.
*  As you described the French notion
*  of sleeping with a problem,
*  I think what the image that comes to mind
*  is that perhaps the idea is
*  if you're going to sleep with a problem,
*  that you should be the big spoon
*  and they should be the little spoon.
*  As opposed to the problem being the big spoon
*  and you're kind of wrapped in the problem,
*  maybe the problem needs to mesh with you,
*  but maybe I'm taking this imagery a little too far.
*  Before we close out this discussion
*  about sleep and creativity,
*  I can't help but bring up a set of questions
*  around a different non-sleep protocol
*  that in many ways seems to mimic sleep
*  and that for some individuals throughout history,
*  in particular the great physicist Richard Feynman,
*  another habitual napper.
*  Yeah, and an absolute idol of mine.
*  Wrote about and spoke about his fondness
*  for these flotation tanks
*  that contain a temperature of water
*  that is fairly neutral so one doesn't recognize
*  the difference between body temperature
*  and the surrounding water.
*  And there's a certain amount of salt salinity in the water
*  that allows one to float at a depth within the water
*  that one loses their sense of proprioceptive awareness
*  as you described earlier in the series,
*  a key component of falling asleep.
*  And he talked about how under those conditions
*  in the flotation tank, there was a kind of an untethering
*  of one's notions of space and time
*  that were very sleep-like and that that was one of his
*  go-tos for creative solutions.
*  People talked about walks as a go-to for creative solutions.
*  In the shower, people seem to come up
*  with creative solutions.
*  States of mind where there are activities
*  where it's only somewhat goal-directed,
*  but basically the idea is to just lose track
*  of one's body positioning and let the mind go, so to speak.
*  And for that matter, psychedelics have on occasion
*  been attributed as at least one of the sources
*  of creative solutions.
*  I raised these ideas, understanding that each one of those
*  could be a podcast into itself.
*  But it seems to me that sleep, and in particular,
*  dream sleep, is nature's way of creating these states
*  of untethering our rigid linear understanding
*  of what relates to what.
*  And it provides this near-magical mixing
*  of things learned the day before,
*  and that's the essence of creativity.
*  And humans have been trying to tap into the creative process
*  through all these other portals for a long time
*  with expensive technologies.
*  But it's becoming very clear to me
*  that the technology already exists,
*  and that it costs absolutely nothing.
*  And that it has tremendous health benefits
*  in addition to its benefits for creativity,
*  and that technology is this brilliant technology of sleep.
*  Yeah, and dreaming, it's a stunning state.
*  Matt, thank you so much for today's discussion
*  about sleep, memory, learning, and creativity.
*  We are now four episodes into this series on sleep.
*  First episode, we discussed, rather, you taught us
*  about sleep and the biology of sleep,
*  as well as some actionable takeaways.
*  So actually, I would say some important guidelines
*  for getting one's sleep correct.
*  And then in this second episode,
*  you went much further into protocols,
*  both basic and advanced, for getting one's sleep right,
*  maybe even optimized.
*  And in the third episode,
*  you taught us about naps and caffeine.
*  And today, you've taken us on a beautiful exploration
*  of the relationship between sleep and learning.
*  What's more interesting than neuroplasticity and learning?
*  I mean, after all, humans are unique in our ability
*  to learn so many things throughout the lifespan.
*  It's one of the things that distinguishes us
*  from the other species on the planet,
*  the very, very long window, perhaps lifelong window,
*  for the opportunity to learn.
*  And of course, creativity and novel solutions
*  to challenging problems in the world,
*  but also great works of art and music, et cetera.
*  I think we can fairly say,
*  based on what you've taught us today,
*  that sleep has been not only the bedrock of mental health,
*  physical health, and performance
*  since the beginning of time and still now,
*  but also has been one of the fundamental drivers
*  of human evolution because of all the creative insights
*  that have occurred and all the learning
*  that's occurred in sleep that's then been transformed
*  into real world technologies.
*  And indeed, it's much of the way that we have
*  the blessing of being right here, right now.
*  If that's the flag that you're raising,
*  I will salute it, Five Ways Till Tuesday, very much yes.
*  Well, I'll salute that flag right with you.
*  And also point to the exciting fact
*  that the next episode, episode five in this series,
*  you're going to teach us about the really tight relationship
*  between sleep and emotional processing and emotionality.
*  And I can't think of a more interesting topic to get into,
*  especially at this point in the series.
*  And I look forward to that discussion
*  with emotional enthusiasm.
*  I can't wait.
*  Folks are interested in trying to modulate
*  their mental health.
*  I think that next discussion should be very helpful
*  with regard to sleep.
*  I hope so, at least.
