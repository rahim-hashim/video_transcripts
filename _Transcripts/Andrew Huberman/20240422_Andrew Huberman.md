# Dr. Bonnie Halpern-Felsher: Vaping, Alcohol Use & Other Risky Youth Behaviors
**Andrew Huberman:** [April 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlc4VrDx_qk)
*  Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
*  where we discuss science and science-based tools
*  for everyday life.
*  I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology
*  and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.
*  My guest today is Dr. Bonnie Halpern-Felscher.
*  Dr. Bonnie Halpern-Felscher is a professor of pediatrics
*  and adolescent medicine
*  at Stanford University School of Medicine.
*  A developmental psychologist by training,
*  Dr. Halpern-Felscher is a world expert
*  in the risk behaviors that adolescents, teens,
*  and young adults participate in.
*  Today, we discuss nicotine use, both by way of smoking,
*  as well as vaping and e-cigarette use.
*  We also discuss cannabis and some of the correlative,
*  as well as possibly causal data,
*  linking cannabis use to psychosis in young adults.
*  And we discuss some of the other common risky behaviors
*  that adolescents, teens, and young adults participate in,
*  including risky driving behavior,
*  alcohol consumption, and risky sexual behavior.
*  We discuss the various factors
*  that impact whether or not a young person
*  will participate in risky behaviors,
*  including the family and home,
*  as well as peer group and social media.
*  And as we discuss social media,
*  we get into a deep discussion
*  about how marketing is combining with peer pressure
*  in order to drive youth toward particular risky behaviors.
*  By the end of today's conversation,
*  you will have learned from Dr. Halpern-Felscher
*  the latest research on risk-taking behavior
*  in adolescents, teens, and young adults,
*  and what we can each and all do
*  to ensure that they either avoid these behaviors
*  or if they are already engaging in these behaviors,
*  that we can mitigate some of the potential harms
*  and potentially get them to eliminate these behaviors
*  toward having a life of enhanced mental and physical health.
*  Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
*  is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
*  It is, however, part of my desire and effort
*  to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
*  and science-related tools to the general public.
*  In keeping with that theme,
*  I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
*  Our first sponsor is 8Sleep.
*  8Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling, heating,
*  and sleep tracking capacity.
*  Now, I've spoken many times before in this podcast
*  about the critical need to get sleep,
*  both enough sleep and enough quality sleep.
*  When we do that, everything,
*  our mental health, our physical health,
*  performance in any sports or school, et cetera,
*  all get better.
*  And when we're not sleeping well or enough,
*  all those things suffer.
*  One of the key things to getting a great night's sleep
*  is that your body temperature actually has to drop
*  by about one to three degrees
*  in order to fall and stay deeply asleep.
*  And in order to wake up feeling refreshed,
*  your body temperature actually has to increase
*  by about one to three degrees.
*  One of the best ways to ensure that happens
*  is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment.
*  And with 8Sleep, it makes it very easy to do that.
*  You program in the temperature that you want
*  at the beginning, middle, and end of the night.
*  You can even divide the temperature
*  for two different people,
*  if you have two different people sleeping in the bed,
*  and it tracks your sleep.
*  It tells you how much slow wave sleep
*  and rapid eye movement sleep you're getting.
*  It really helps you dial in the correct parameters
*  to get the best possible night's sleep for you.
*  I've been sleeping on an 8Sleep mattress cover
*  for well over three years now,
*  and it has completely transformed my sleep for the better.
*  If you'd like to try 8Sleep,
*  you can go to 8Sleep.com slash Huberman
*  and save $150 off their pod three cover.
*  8Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, UK,
*  select countries in the EU and Australia.
*  Again, that's 8Sleep.com slash Huberman.
*  Today's episode is also brought to us by Matina.
*  Matina makes loose leaf and ready to drink yerba mate.
*  I often discuss yerba mate's benefits,
*  such as regulating blood sugar,
*  its high antioxidant content,
*  the ways that it can improve digestion,
*  and possible neuroprotective effects.
*  I also drink yerba mate because I love the taste.
*  While there are a lot of different choices
*  of yerba mate drinks out there,
*  I love Matina because, again,
*  they have the no sugar variety,
*  as well as the fact that both their loose leaf
*  and their canned varieties are of the absolute best quality.
*  So much so that I decided to become a partial owner
*  in the company.
*  Although I must say,
*  even if they hadn't allowed me to do that,
*  I would be drinking Matina is the cleanest tasting
*  and best yerba mate you can find.
*  I love the taste of brewed loose leaf Matina yerba mate,
*  and I particularly love the taste of Matina's new
*  canned cold brew zero sugar yerba mate,
*  which I personally helped them develop.
*  If you'd like to try Matina,
*  go to drinkmatina.com slash Huberman.
*  Right now, Matina is offering a free one pound bag
*  of loose leaf yerba mate tea and free shipping
*  with the purchase of two cases of their cold brew yerba mate.
*  Again, that's drinkmatina.com slash Huberman
*  to get the free bag of yerba mate loose leaf tea
*  and free shipping.
*  Today's episode is also brought to us by Element.
*  Element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need
*  and nothing you don't.
*  That means zero sugar and the appropriate ratios
*  of the electrolytes, sodium, magnesium, and potassium.
*  And that correct ratio of electrolytes
*  is extremely important because every cell in your body,
*  but especially your nerve cells, your neurons,
*  relies on electrolytes in order to function properly.
*  So when you're well hydrated and your hydration
*  also includes the appropriate ratios of electrolytes,
*  your mental functioning
*  and your physical functioning is improved.
*  I drink one packet of Element dissolved
*  in about 16 to 32 ounces of water
*  when I wake up in the morning,
*  as well as while I exercise.
*  And if I've sweat a lot during that exercise,
*  I often will drink a third Element packet dissolved
*  in about 32 ounces of water after I exercise.
*  If you'd like to try Element,
*  you can go to drinkelement spelled LMNT.com slash Huberman
*  to try a free sample pack.
*  Again, that's drinkelement.com slash Huberman.
*  And now for my discussion with Dr. Bonnie Halpern-Felscher.
*  Dr. Halpern-Felscher, welcome.
*  Thank you so much for having me.
*  We're going to talk about a very important
*  and sometimes troubling period of life,
*  not always troubling, but I think for everyone,
*  adolescents and the teen years,
*  youth essentially is a tricky landscape.
*  Yes, it is.
*  It can be.
*  Yeah, as our brain and bodies mature,
*  we have more autonomy in where we take them,
*  but that means also more exposure to the ideas,
*  suggestions, actions, peer pressure of others.
*  That's sometimes where the problems arise,
*  and who knows, probably also where the solutions come from,
*  too, from time to time.
*  But I think as conscientious people
*  who mind the wellbeing of others of our species,
*  we'd all like to know,
*  what are the key features
*  that mark this stage of development?
*  Maybe we'll just start off by talking about this
*  through the lens of your expertise
*  as a developmental psychologist.
*  What is adolescence in the teen years?
*  What's going on?
*  What sorts of things are being worked out psychologically
*  that we might not be aware of?
*  And then we can talk about some of the common pitfalls
*  and the risk-taking behavior,
*  everything from smoking, vaping, drug use,
*  sexual behavior, addictive behaviors
*  as it relates to social media, bullying, risky driving.
*  There's so much there,
*  but maybe we could just look at this stage of youth
*  through the lens of a developmental psychologist
*  and share with us anything you feel is worth knowing.
*  Sure, so first of all, ages.
*  Adolescents can be anywhere from starting roughly
*  around age 10, some people would say ending around age 18,
*  maybe 21, if you wanna go into young adulthood,
*  then maybe mid-20s.
*  And really, adolescence is a wonderful time of,
*  as you said, exploration.
*  It's a time when, first of all,
*  marked by pubertal changes, onset of menses for girls,
*  and really the pubertal and physical development,
*  secondary sexual characteristics are coming out.
*  We also have a lot of emotional development
*  going on during this time.
*  Height changes are occurring during this time,
*  but we're getting a lot of social changes as well,
*  as you said, peer pressures.
*  So why misnomerous parents think that they don't matter
*  during adolescence?
*  They still really matter.
*  The peers also come in and matter quite a bit.
*  And then teens are really trying to figure out who they are.
*  You get a lot of questions, who am I?
*  Where am I going in life?
*  What do I wanna do when I grow up?
*  What's important to me?
*  How do other people feel about me?
*  And then how do I feel about other people?
*  So a lot of the social and psychosocial development
*  is happening as well.
*  And you get asynchronous development too
*  if a young person, for example, starts puberty
*  at a younger age, say 10,
*  where they're physically looking older, more mature,
*  but emotionally and psychosocially,
*  they still might be young versus the late matures,
*  physical matures who may be not having
*  and looking like an older teen or an adult till 16, 17, 18,
*  but they're more mature emotionally than others,
*  then you might have some confusion to that young person.
*  I look older, but I don't feel older and stuff like that.
*  But it's really this wonderful time of exploration
*  for an adolescent and a time of really wanting autonomy
*  and wanting to make a lot of decisions
*  that we should like them make,
*  but there are some risks
*  that we have to be careful about at the same time.
*  I've often heard this word autonomy
*  as it relates to this stage of puberty in the teen years.
*  You mentioned that kids of that age
*  still really need their parents.
*  In the last, gosh, 20, 30 years in this country,
*  there's been a market increase in the frequency of divorce.
*  Is there any direct evidence that single parent homes
*  or homes where, I don't know, people are remarried
*  or just basically divorced homes
*  are somehow creating more challenges
*  in terms of risk taking behavior in adolescents and teens
*  or not, because I know plenty of people
*  who had grew up in single parent homes,
*  sometimes parents remarried and sometimes didn't.
*  By my mind, I can't seem to come up
*  with any direct correlation.
*  Plenty of those kids did fine
*  and plenty of kids in two parent homes
*  that I know had challenges and vice versa.
*  Yeah, I haven't contributed,
*  actually, that was some of my earlier dissertation work,
*  and I haven't really contributed to that literature
*  for a while, but what you're saying
*  is pretty accurate to what I've seen,
*  which is really the literature would say
*  it's not the divorce per se,
*  it's the conflict that is happening.
*  So if parents actually get divorced,
*  usually if the conflict resumes,
*  teenagers and children generally do well,
*  and particularly within about two years.
*  If the conflict resolves.
*  If the conflict resolves, right.
*  So you can have two parents who are married
*  and living in the same home
*  and may or may not be a good relationship,
*  but living in the same home,
*  if there's no conflict,
*  then generally teens will do well,
*  or as you're saying,
*  there's not necessarily a direct correlation.
*  The problem comes in whether parents
*  are living at home together or separated or divorced
*  is if there's conflict,
*  and then that conflict tends to result in social issues,
*  emotional issues, a lot of social anxiety,
*  a lot of feeling like I need to do better
*  so that way my parents like me more,
*  and we see that with children too,
*  that's not just adolescents.
*  A lot of depression,
*  and with depression can come self-medication,
*  self-medicating around other drugs and so on,
*  but that generally is resolved if the conflict resolves.
*  But as you're saying,
*  we're seeing adolescent angst regardless of parenting.
*  What we really need though,
*  it's not a matter of just the divorce or not divorce
*  or the relationship between the parents,
*  it's parenting that's important.
*  So parents being good monitors,
*  being involved in their kids' lives, not this,
*  oh, you're 16, you have a car,
*  you can go wherever you want,
*  and we're not gonna keep an eye on you.
*  We still need parents to monitor, to pay attention,
*  to find out their kids' friends,
*  where are they going after school.
*  That discretionary time when parents are working
*  and teenagers come home between three and five
*  or three and six tends to be the most risky couple of hours.
*  It's called discretionary hours
*  where there's no parent around,
*  and we don't always know
*  where those teenagers are hanging out.
*  So that's more important,
*  knowing where their children are and what they're doing
*  and that there's some adult presence, some monitoring,
*  than whether or not they're still in a relationship.
*  My sense is that smartphones have allowed
*  more communication and monitoring between parents and kids,
*  but also more interactions between kids
*  and other kids and kids and adults more broadly.
*  So is there any evidence that the advent of smartphones
*  is directly creating problems for kids
*  that has to do with just so much more
*  peer-to-peer interaction or peer-to-peer exposure?
*  Like when I was growing up, we didn't have smartphones.
*  If you did something stupid,
*  like that meaning that kids would laugh at,
*  it might get told to a small group of people,
*  maybe a larger group of people,
*  but in general, it just kind of didn't go anywhere.
*  You're like, ah, I screwed up.
*  And then you get teased a bit
*  and then it would kind of dissipate.
*  But now, of course, that can propagate
*  very, very far, very fast.
*  Is there any evidence that that mere fact
*  is creating issues for kids?
*  So I would say it's not a blanket statement.
*  I think it depends on the behavior
*  that we're talking about.
*  Bullying, no doubt, the example that you gave,
*  no doubt that if you mess up, if you do something stupid,
*  it's getting filmed and it's going to go viral.
*  It will go on social media
*  and then it will perpetuate and escalate
*  amongst the peers.
*  That we definitely know is happening.
*  And certainly in terms of drug use and marketing,
*  there's definitely some peer-to-peer interaction.
*  Look how cool I am. Look at the smoke ring I did.
*  Look at other things that I've been doing.
*  There is no doubt.
*  But in general, there are also some good things about it.
*  Parent communication,
*  they can monitor where their children are.
*  They can put a tracker on the phone.
*  I know with my own kids, sometimes it was the best way to say,
*  you seem a little sad when face-to-face communication
*  wasn't happening, I could use the phone
*  to have that conversation.
*  So yes, there is some evidence that overall phones
*  and smartphones have increased risk behavior.
*  But it's more the access to the behavior
*  and then the viruleness of really getting that information out.
*  Like you said, if somebody screws up, somebody dresses wrong,
*  if somebody kisses somebody, that could go pretty viral.
*  I wouldn't say that smartphones and social media as a whole
*  is the problem.
*  I think it's situation-specific and behavior-specific
*  that we're seeing, and particularly around marketing,
*  for example, that teenagers have more access now to YouTube,
*  to marketing, that they're promoting,
*  not only are industries promoting, for example, e-cigarettes
*  or cannabis promoting to young people,
*  but teens are promoting to each other.
*  And that we didn't see before smartphones, right?
*  I took a picture or Instagram, look at me smoking
*  or look at me dressing sexy, or look at me looking cool
*  or anything like that.
*  That didn't happen before.
*  It was more just word of mouth.
*  So that is definitely where we're a lot more concerned
*  about social media.
*  But more my concern about social media
*  is the outside world targeting young people.
*  That's where I've been the biggest concern about it.
*  Teenagers targeting each other with bullying, no doubt,
*  big issue, but in other ways, there's more support.
*  There's more social interaction.
*  The other time I get concerned though around teenagers
*  is more the social piece of sitting around together
*  at a table and they're not talking, they're on the phones.
*  So what we really don't know enough is how is the not getting
*  out and playing and instead playing on a game,
*  not going to the park and instead communicating
*  through phones, how is that changing their social
*  and physical development is where I'm also very concerned.
*  Yeah, I have family relatives who are in their teens
*  and it's interesting to see them interact
*  whether on their phones a lot of the time.
*  But I've also noticed that there's a cohort of kids
*  that are really trying to put their phones away
*  and just spend time together.
*  And that was actually directly stated to me that,
*  oh yeah, we hang out and we make it a point not to be
*  on our phones when we hang out.
*  But then of course they'll text or be on the iPad
*  with one another in the evening when they're apart.
*  So they're sort of never apart.
*  But I do think there seems to be at least a sub movement
*  of kids and teens that are trying to do more
*  face-to-face interaction with devices at least put aside.
*  I think that's a really good point.
*  I've talked to some teens who say that they get together
*  and they will deliberately put the phones face down
*  in the middle, no phones and have dinner
*  or have a conversation.
*  So I think you're right.
*  I definitely think that that has been a movement
*  and I really appreciate that and I think that's fantastic.
*  I've also seen circumstances where two teens are trying
*  to help each other with homework
*  and they're texting each other, which is fine.
*  But I've often said, why don't you just pick up the phone
*  and call the person and in five minutes
*  you can figure out the math assignment
*  instead of 20, 30 minutes of back and forth.
*  It's just not as efficient unless you're literally copying
*  and showing the picture.
*  But is that having a change on their social
*  or physical development or emotional development?
*  Probably not.
*  It's just a different world, the way that they communicate.
*  And that's why I say, I'm less worried in some ways,
*  as long as they're still getting out and they're playing
*  and they're being creative, I'm less worried about
*  that kind of social interaction on phones and social media.
*  It's a different way.
*  We don't have a lot of evidence to say one way or the other,
*  but if they're still doing the things that they should be
*  doing as young people, my concern is that outside world,
*  the concern of predatory behaviors, the concern of industry,
*  the concern of mass media and marketing to teens,
*  that's the part that gets me particularly worried.
*  Yeah, well, we know for sure that this is the first time
*  in human evolution that humans have essentially written
*  with their thumbs.
*  There's gotta be a massive expansion
*  of the brain's representation of the thumbs
*  relative to 20, 30 years ago.
*  But maybe now would be a good time to talk about
*  risky behaviors or even just behaviors that are known
*  to have some detriment to health, smoking and vaping
*  and e-cigarettes primarily.
*  And we should be probably distinguishing between nicotine
*  and cannabis.
*  Maybe let's just start with nicotine.
*  What are the statistics on smoking, vaping and e-cigarettes?
*  Just rough statistics.
*  I saw a talk that you did online that cited some pretty
*  outrageous increases in or shocking increases in smoking
*  and vaping in the last couple of years, just staggering.
*  So maybe if you give us the top contour of those.
*  Sure, absolutely.
*  So the good news is smoking rates,
*  conventional cigarette smoking rates has gone down
*  pretty dramatically in the last couple of decades
*  with teenagers, with all people in the US,
*  which is wonderful, but teenagers to well below 10%,
*  if not really well below 5% of teenagers.
*  That's the good news.
*  In terms of e-cigarette use, which I prefer the term
*  e-cigarette use than vaping, because they're not vapes,
*  they're aerosols, but e-cigarette use has gone up
*  pretty dramatically.
*  So e-cigarettes came on the market in the US in 2007
*  and they were slowed for uptick amongst teenagers.
*  They looked like cigarettes when they first came
*  on the market.
*  They weren't very popular with teenagers.
*  They didn't have, they had some flavors, not a lot.
*  Didn't have a lot of nicotine.
*  It was probably around 2011 to 2014,
*  we started seeing an uptick, but then it was really
*  in 2017 to 19 that we saw a dramatic increase.
*  And that was the statistics that we saw upwards of 27
*  to 29% of teens using e-cigarettes during those
*  couple of years.
*  Daily use?
*  Past 30 days.
*  So any use in the past 30 days was, and in daily use
*  will be some smaller percentage of that.
*  It was something like a 78% increase in high school
*  student use and a 48% increase in middle school use
*  over those couple of years.
*  So a very dramatic increase in use.
*  Since 2019, it's gone down, but I'm gonna give a caveat.
*  It's gone down in 2020 to the national numbers are showing.
*  It went to around 20% and now around 10%.
*  Part of that was in 2020, we had COVID and initiation
*  of e-cigarette use really occurs socially.
*  Going back to socialization, it's a lot of teens
*  getting together and it's not peer pressure
*  of you have to try, come on, try this.
*  It's more like my friends are using, I'm at a party,
*  I feel like using, yeah, I'll try it.
*  Well, during the pandemic and the shutdown,
*  teens were not at school, they weren't with their friends.
*  So initiation went down.
*  Teens who were addicted, and we can certainly talk about
*  the levels of nicotine and e-cigarettes,
*  but teens who were addicted continues to use.
*  Some tried to quit, which was great,
*  but we still saw a fair amount of use.
*  So part of the decrease in those 2020 to 2021
*  have to do with just access and socialization had changed
*  and so rates went down.
*  Since then, even we publish a paper showing relationships
*  between COVID and vaping.
*  We saw EVALI, e-cigarette and vaping
*  associated lung illness.
*  So that we think was part of why we also saw further drops
*  around 2021, but people were concerned about
*  their lung health and teens as well, and that's great.
*  The latest data show that the rates are under 10%,
*  the national data.
*  I actually don't think it's true.
*  And the reason I don't think it's true is
*  I'm in the schools doing curriculum presentations
*  all the time where I teach and educate teachers
*  to use our tobacco and cannabis prevention curriculums.
*  And we've never been busier than we are right now
*  with schools just crying for help.
*  We have another group of teenagers using e-cigarettes,
*  nicotine or cannabis or whatever.
*  It's way more than 10%.
*  I would say schools are telling me
*  that it's 40 to 60% of their students are using e-cigarettes.
*  For nicotine?
*  We don't know.
*  Or cannabis.
*  It's very hard to know.
*  It's very hard to know what's in there.
*  But the point is- 40 to 60%.
*  That's what the schools are saying.
*  At some point in the last 30 days.
*  At some point in the last 30 days.
*  They're catching just exorbitant numbers
*  of students using right now.
*  And so from a science perspective, is it 10%, 20%, 30?
*  We don't know.
*  I can just tell you that the national CDC data would say 10%.
*  And maybe it's a problem with the surveys
*  or the questions or teens aren't being honest.
*  But from a school's perspective, it's much higher.
*  And then we have some national data suggesting
*  it's more than 20 to 30 to 40% range as well.
*  Whatever it is, it's too many.
*  It's too many teens who are inhaling nicotine
*  and cannabis as well.
*  Well, a lot to unpack there.
*  First of all, nicotine.
*  I did an episode of the podcast about nicotine
*  and a little bit of that got confused in the way it landed.
*  So I'll just quickly state that nicotine,
*  known cognitive enhancer,
*  also known to dramatically increase blood pressure
*  and vasoconstriction, not healthy for the body.
*  Just to be clear, it's not healthy for the body.
*  So when people hear that it's a cognitive enhancer
*  that increases focus and alertness, that's true.
*  In the short term, highly addictive,
*  highly, highly addictive and habit forming
*  since sometimes those are separated.
*  Maybe we delve into that distinction.
*  But by my observation,
*  very few people can use nicotine occasionally.
*  People who try it seem to like it,
*  at least in the short run, and keep using it.
*  So presumably kids are using,
*  or I should say youth are using nicotine
*  either by vape or e-cigarette.
*  And they quote unquote like the way it makes them feel.
*  Who knows, maybe it allows them
*  to focus on their studies better, I don't know.
*  But it is known to improve certain forms of cognition,
*  but only transiently and it's highly addictive
*  and it's bad for their health, for anyone's health.
*  So that puts us in a kind of a tricky situation
*  when evaluating the statistics that you just laid out.
*  Because one wonders, are they taking it
*  and then continuing to take it because of peer pressure,
*  because of lack of peer pressure to not do it,
*  because it helps them with their schoolwork,
*  because they're naturally a little bit depressed
*  and it provides a kind of antidepressant signal.
*  I mean, what do we know about why they're actually starting
*  and why they're continuing
*  and why they are reluctant to quit?
*  May we just parse those?
*  So why does a teenager try nicotine?
*  So there are a few reasons why they start
*  based on the literature, scientific literature
*  and just talking to teens.
*  One has to do with the marketing, no doubt.
*  If you look at the marketing, it is targeting young people.
*  It's targeting them with, first of all,
*  the devices themselves, they are cool looking.
*  They're easy to hide.
*  They look like USB devices.
*  They look like highlighters.
*  In fact, there's a new brand out called Highlight
*  that is a highlighter, that's a working highlighter,
*  but it's actually a nicotine e-cigarette.
*  So a highlighter pen to study.
*  Highlighter pen to study,
*  but it's actually, you take the cover off
*  and it's actually a nicotine e-cigarette device.
*  Clearly marketed towards students.
*  Clearly marketed towards students.
*  You have what's it called, boba teas, drinks.
*  Oh yeah, the tea with the, yeah.
*  Yeah, the little, mimicking that drink
*  that's actually, that the straw is actually the vaping,
*  inhaling there, little pieces.
*  You have Star Wars shapes.
*  It goes on and on, just the cartoon shapes
*  that are clearly being targeted to,
*  not just teenagers, children that we're seeing.
*  Children like young children?
*  Children like young children.
*  So what I-
*  Wait, so I'm shocked.
*  So kids younger than 10
*  are having these products pushed their way?
*  They are.
*  And actually I didn't tell you in the statistics,
*  the statistics I was citing,
*  I should go back and clarify a couple there
*  that are even more shocking.
*  So those are the numbers from middle and high school.
*  We don't have data from elementary,
*  but again, the other part in addition to the science
*  I contribute to, the interventions I do,
*  I am getting elementary school teachers calling us for help.
*  They are catching second and third graders
*  using nicotine cigarettes.
*  I'm not kidding.
*  And not just one or two, quite a bit.
*  We said we would never develop an elementary school version
*  of a vaping prevention curriculum.
*  That's what we call ours.
*  You and me together, vape free.
*  We would never, we have a middle school and a high school.
*  We were never gonna do elementary.
*  We've had so many schools across the country
*  call us and say, we need something for elementary.
*  So we actually created a curriculum.
*  So we're having, there was a story of an eight year old
*  back East who was caught and using,
*  and the teachers and police didn't know what to do.
*  And of course I said, it's not a police matter.
*  Why aren't we helping this young person?
*  So we're seeing younger now, sometimes they're starting
*  because they're siblings, older siblings.
*  It's being marketed to.
*  They don't realize that it's a nicotine cigarette
*  or cannabis e-cigarette.
*  They just don't realize what it is.
*  But the number of these products that are being targeted
*  to young people is absolutely ridiculous
*  what they look like.
*  The pictures are endless.
*  And the problem is they're coming out with new products
*  every few months that are targeting kids.
*  So marketing.
*  The other is flavors and flavors of marketing
*  go hand in hand.
*  If it looks bad, it looks like, or it smells like
*  and tastes like nicotine or tobacco,
*  teens know that that's gross.
*  That's why we don't have cigarette use anymore.
*  We've socialized our country to say, if you smell tobacco,
*  it's nothing that we want to smell.
*  We walk away from it, you walk across the street, whatever.
*  We've done a really good job in tobacco control
*  getting the word out around that.
*  These products, e-cigarettes, smell and taste like sugar,
*  like sweets, like dessert, like candy.
*  So you've got, and the names are things like
*  unicorn poop and sugar booger and honey doodoo.
*  That's not for adults.
*  Those names are squarely for kids.
*  It's kids who are using chocolate.
*  It's kids who are using these flavors that are on the market.
*  And then the marketing around it are these,
*  I mean, they're beautiful.
*  There are these pizzazz of pineapple dancing around
*  or strawberries dancing or whatever it is
*  that are very animated.
*  There are juice box style that have come out,
*  juice box style, vaping devices
*  that are marketed looking like juice boxes.
*  And that's not targeting you and me.
*  That's targeting a kid.
*  Interesting and scary to hear all this.
*  I'd like to take a brief break
*  and acknowledge our sponsor, AG1.
*  By now, most of you have heard me tell my story
*  about how I've been taking AG1 once or twice a day,
*  every day since 2012.
*  And indeed that's true.
*  I started taking AG1 and I still take AG1
*  once or twice a day because it gives me vitamins
*  and minerals that I might not be getting enough of
*  from whole foods that I eat,
*  as well as adaptogens and micronutrients.
*  Those adaptogens and micronutrients are really critical
*  because even though I strive to eat most of my foods
*  from unprocessed or minimally processed whole foods,
*  it's often hard to do so, especially when I'm traveling
*  and especially when I'm busy.
*  So by drinking a packet of AG1 in the morning
*  and oftentimes also again in the afternoon or evening,
*  I'm ensuring that I'm getting everything I need.
*  I'm covering all of my foundational nutritional needs.
*  And I, like so many other people that take AG1 regularly,
*  just report feeling better.
*  And that shouldn't be surprising
*  because it supports gut health
*  and of course gut health supports immune system health
*  and brain health, and it's supporting a ton
*  of different cellular and organ processes
*  that all interact with one another.
*  So while certain supplements are really directed
*  towards one specific outcome,
*  like sleeping better or being more alert,
*  AG1 really is foundational nutritional support.
*  It's really designed to support all of the systems
*  of your brain and body that relate to mental health
*  and physical health.
*  If you'd like to try AG1,
*  you can go to drinkag1.com slash Huberman
*  to claim a special offer.
*  They'll give you five free travel packs with your order
*  plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
*  Again, that's drinkag1.com slash Huberman.
*  What percentage of adults in the US vapor use e-cigarettes
*  just by way of comparison?
*  I've seen numbers anywhere from 5% to around 20%,
*  depending on the statistic.
*  I actually haven't looked at the latest data on adults.
*  But the majority of adults who are using,
*  it's a little bit different to think about it.
*  Adults are using, generally,
*  they're not initiating tobacco through e-cigarettes.
*  They're generally, and I'm talking 30 and up,
*  they generally have been smoking cigarettes
*  and then maybe they're trying to use e-cigarettes to quit,
*  which is a whole nother set of literature
*  that it's not necessarily as effective
*  as we're hoping that it is.
*  There isn't good literature on a population level
*  that e-cigarettes help adults quit cigarettes.
*  The difference with teenagers
*  is they're initiating with e-cigarettes
*  and they're not saying, huh, here's a cigarette,
*  here's an e-cigarette, which one do I choose?
*  It's not that they're substituting or replacing.
*  They're not using cigarettes.
*  Some are now because they're switching back and forth,
*  but they're initiating with e-cigarettes.
*  They're initiating because of the marketing.
*  They're initiating because of the flavors
*  and the products and the ability to hide it.
*  Parents don't know what these products look like.
*  So the landscape is very different.
*  So you were telling us why teens and adolescents start vaping.
*  The marketing is clearly oriented toward them.
*  There are a number of reinforcing factors
*  that at least to my mind, as you're describing all this,
*  make it sound like this stuff is supposed to be
*  quote unquote playful, that it's not a drug,
*  that sort of thing.
*  It reminds me a little bit of sugary cereals.
*  When I was a kid, you'd buy the cereal
*  because you wanted the taste,
*  but you also wanted the colorful box,
*  you had the cartoons that it related to on TV,
*  and there's usually a toy inside that you wanted,
*  some surprise that you could then collect across boxes.
*  So there was a lot of levels of incentivization.
*  Why do they keep smoking or vaping?
*  Are they addicted to nicotine?
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  So the other reason why they start is they like the taste
*  and they like the rush.
*  So I've talked to, so that's the other piece says.
*  So a few more reasons why they start
*  and then certainly answer your question around the nicotine.
*  Teens have told me outright that they like the taste,
*  they like the rush, they like the buzz.
*  And we could talk about how much nicotine is in there.
*  It's astonishing and I can explain that,
*  but they like the buzz.
*  Another reason by the way, is stress and coping.
*  Right now, teens are so stressed out.
*  They've been stressed out for years,
*  but they're particularly stressed with the pandemic.
*  And even though we're a couple years out of the lockdown,
*  teens are still, they're having socialization issues,
*  social emotional learning issues.
*  They're still confused.
*  They missed a couple of years,
*  particularly high school students
*  may have missed part of middle school
*  where you're learning to socialize with other people.
*  So they're very stressed.
*  And we know that there's a pretty strong relationship
*  between stress, not being able to cope
*  and using any drug, but including nicotine.
*  So there's a lot of different reasons why young people,
*  and certainly the peers.
*  And again, it's not peer pressure,
*  it's more like a lot of friends are using it.
*  I've talked to teens who say,
*  I wasn't intending on, but I tried it.
*  Wow, I really liked the taste, I liked the flavor.
*  And then there's the amount of nicotine that's in there.
*  In 2015, when the newer products came on the market,
*  it was a salt-based nicotine.
*  So cigarettes and then earlier e-cigarettes
*  have a free-based nicotine.
*  Free-based nicotine uses ammonia and sugar
*  to bind to the nicotine and the other chemicals.
*  There's hundreds of chemicals in there
*  to go through the body, lungs, into the brain
*  and give you that rush.
*  The free-based nicotine is very caustic.
*  If you think the litmus test,
*  it's very much on the basic side of the litmus test there.
*  And if you're a nicotine-naive youth,
*  which again, most teens starting with nicotine e-cigarettes
*  have not used nicotine before,
*  when you start, you don't want that caustic,
*  throat-hit feeling, that's how it's described.
*  Teens will say they don't like it, they cough, it tasted bad.
*  Well, to an adult who's been using cigarettes,
*  they don't mind that, they're used to it, but a teen is not.
*  Well, I will mention Joel here, because it's relevant.
*  Joel came on the market in 2015 with a salt-based nicotine.
*  Which essentially, for those who aren't familiar
*  with caustic and litmus tests and things like that,
*  the salt-based nicotine, as I understand,
*  is quote-unquote smoother.
*  Correct.
*  It causes less sort of coughing,
*  static contraction of the muscles in the mouth and throat,
*  and so it's basically more palpable,
*  and more of a kind of gradual on-ramp,
*  which is exactly what a company wants
*  if you want somebody to start using something.
*  You don't want to hit them square in the face.
*  That's exactly right, that's exactly right.
*  So salt-based nicotine generally uses benzoic acid
*  to move that litmus test needle from the caustic
*  towards acidic, because it's an acid,
*  but really towards neutral.
*  So you know, exactly.
*  So when you use it, it's smooth, it's easy to use,
*  you don't have that throat hit, you don't cough,
*  you don't feel sick from it.
*  So teens will say, and I've talked to teens
*  and young adults who tried earlier e-cigarettes
*  and didn't like it, and then tried the salt-based style
*  and said, ooh, I like it, coupled with the flavors.
*  It's also more absorbent.
*  So there's some suggestion and some early evidence
*  that it's also more addictive.
*  So when those products first came on the market,
*  before earlier e-cigarettes had say zero
*  to 36 milligrams of nicotine, suddenly we jumped up
*  to 59 milligrams per mil, which is about, generally
*  about a 40, 41 milligram, because it's about a 0.7 mil.
*  Sorry, little chemistry and math that we do a lot here,
*  but you're looking at, basically, it's anywhere
*  from the nicotine that you see in either one
*  to two packs of cigarettes.
*  Per? Per device, per pod, per e-cigarette device.
*  And how long does a pod typically last?
*  Let's say like a 15 or 16 year old kid
*  who's taking a hit off the vape pen,
*  I don't know what, five times a day?
*  So I've asked teens in some of the earlier publications,
*  and they did, now, not with the newer devices,
*  but the older devices, and they would say
*  that they were using a pod a week,
*  which is about two or three cigarettes a day,
*  to one to four pods a day.
*  One to four pods a day? One to four.
*  Now these are highly addicted teenagers,
*  that is one to eight packs of cigarettes,
*  depending on the debates on how much nicotine is in there,
*  but you're looking at several packs of cigarettes
*  worth of nicotine.
*  Okay, so just to backtrack a little bit,
*  which is great,
*  but I want to make sure everyone's on board.
*  The amount of nicotine in one of these pods
*  that goes into the vape pen, or e-cig,
*  is significantly greater than the amount of nicotine
*  in one pack of cigarettes, in many cases.
*  In many cases.
*  And there are many youth, so adolescents and teens,
*  you said before, between ages of 10 and 21,
*  roughly 10 to 18, 10 to 21,
*  that are going through as many as four pods per day,
*  which has to be at least the equivalent
*  of four packs of cigarettes,
*  but could be as much as eight packs of cigarettes per day.
*  Correct.
*  In terms of nicotine concentration.
*  Correct.
*  Now, I guess to be fair,
*  they are not smoking in the traditional sense,
*  so that presumably there's some tars and other contaminants
*  that are not going into their system,
*  but we know that there are a lot of chemicals in these pods
*  besides just nicotine.
*  And I think that's where a big source of the debate
*  and interest is now,
*  is how dangerous are those other chemicals?
*  It's really an interesting question.
*  So a lot of things that you said
*  are really important to highlight.
*  Absolutely.
*  Now, not all teenagers are using four pods a day.
*  These are extremely, very highly addicted teens.
*  And unfortunately, teens we've seen with lung collapses
*  and other pretty significant health issues.
*  Typically teens are using maybe a pod a day.
*  The newer e-cigarettes, by the way,
*  have probably four times that.
*  They're bigger volume,
*  so you're looking at 60, 70 milligrams of nicotine.
*  Some of them are equivalent to about three to 500 cigarettes
*  worth of nicotine.
*  Now, are they using them in a day?
*  Probably not.
*  We haven't done the studies on that,
*  but it's really the first nicotine product we've had
*  that you can use 24 seven.
*  When I've talked to teens,
*  you know, I wake up in the middle of the night,
*  I may check my phone and check my email.
*  Teens are waking up in the middle of the night to take a hit
*  and they're hiding them under their pillows
*  and their nightstands, whatever.
*  And they're telling me that they're just using them
*  all the time.
*  And they could just suck on them all the time.
*  Are they using, when you say all the time,
*  that's interesting, forgive me for interrupting.
*  No, no, no.
*  Are they using it specifically to wake up, to study,
*  or just to maintain baseline?
*  I mean, that's the problem with any addictive substance
*  or habit forming substance is that what starts off
*  as a rush becomes less of a rush.
*  And then when one doesn't use, they feel below baseline.
*  I've done a lot of discussions about dopamine and baseline
*  versus, you know, non-baseline peaks in dopamine.
*  And some of that is smoothed out for general discussion.
*  Dopamine does many things besides set up reward systems
*  and incentives in the brain,
*  but it's at least one of the things it does.
*  So are kids starting off taking nicotine and then,
*  and feeling like, whoa, that makes them feel really elevated
*  in terms of mood, focus, and alertness,
*  and then finding that without it, they're just depressed?
*  Is that the general theme?
*  I'm not trying to lead the witness here.
*  I just want to know what's going on internally.
*  Absolutely.
*  No, no, no, all great questions there.
*  So what we're finding when we talk to teens
*  is that pretty rapidly they are going from,
*  I like it till I need it.
*  So, you know, your multi-part question was just great.
*  What makes them start and what makes them continue?
*  They start because of the flavors and the marketing,
*  and they like the taste and all that.
*  They continue because of that high level of nicotine.
*  And we are seeing that teens are addicted.
*  And we're seeing, we actually published a couple of studies
*  showing that teens who have been using e-cigarettes
*  in the past 30 days,
*  that the majority are showing signs of addiction.
*  Pretty rapidly too within a few weeks.
*  It's such high levels of nicotine.
*  And there are some people who don't believe
*  that teens are becoming addicted to nicotine
*  and that the levels of nicotine are not the same
*  as what we're seeing in cigarettes.
*  That's actually not the case.
*  And we've seen more and more studies.
*  And to the question of using it as soon as they wake up,
*  there's a study by a colleague of mine
*  that showed in the last few years,
*  the data is showing that teens,
*  a greater percentage of teens who use e-cigarettes
*  are doing so in the first five minutes of waking.
*  That is a sign of addiction.
*  So you wake up, maybe go to the bathroom, maybe not,
*  and you take that hit.
*  And so, and all the national data are showing,
*  even though initiation may go down,
*  the percentage of teens who are using daily has gone up.
*  And I attribute that a lot to the type of nicotine,
*  the salt-based nicotine,
*  and to the huge amount of nicotine
*  that's been on the market.
*  So yes, teens are definitely feeling it.
*  They're definitely going through withdrawal symptoms,
*  that feeling, shaking, the sweats,
*  all the feelings that they need, lack of concentration.
*  The problem is when you talk to teens,
*  they think that e-cigarettes are helping with school.
*  And by the way, I've not heard a teen tell me
*  that they started because of school reasons
*  or concentration.
*  Maybe they're continuing for that reason.
*  But teens have said that taking the hit makes them feel good.
*  What they don't understand is it's that
*  it makes them feel not bad, right?
*  The withdrawal is making them feel bad,
*  and they don't realize that that hit
*  and that dopamine rush, that they now need it,
*  that they're going through withdrawal either way.
*  I'm wondering where they're getting the money
*  to pay for all this nicotine.
*  When I was a kid, I worked, I like mowed lawns.
*  I had a newspaper out for a little while,
*  but mostly started working when I think I was about 14 or so.
*  Coffee shop, skateboard shop,
*  bus tables, did that kind of thing.
*  So I made money, and I was able to use that money
*  on the things that were important, music, skateboarding,
*  and bus passes and stuff that that's what it was back then,
*  food, et cetera.
*  Where are 12-year-olds getting the money to buy
*  or even one vape cartridge, pod as you called it per day?
*  Someone's gotta pay for this stuff.
*  Unless they're stealing it, and I can't imagine
*  that they're all stealing it, where are they getting it?
*  How are they getting it?
*  Yeah, it's a great question.
*  So there's not one way.
*  In terms of money, I think there's questions around money
*  and questions around access, right?
*  And they're not necessarily the same thing.
*  Money, babysitting, the problem is
*  when some of the newer products came on the market,
*  some of them, the say 2020, 2021 products
*  were about a dollar or two per pod.
*  Compare that with a pack of cigarettes,
*  which is 10 to $15 depending on the state you live in.
*  So they are cheap, they're easy to get.
*  Now, newer ones and older ones are a few dollars more,
*  but they're not that expensive.
*  They started off very expensive
*  when they first came on the market, but they haven't been.
*  The other is the sharing.
*  And we used to hear about pod parties
*  where somebody buys the device, which is more expensive,
*  buys the device, and then you bring your own,
*  not beer, bring your own pod, which is a few dollars,
*  then you pop it in and then you share it around.
*  We've also heard stories of a few teenagers buying them
*  and then selling for a few cents or a few dollars a puff.
*  So meet me in the bathroom for 50 cents or a dollar,
*  you can have a couple of puffs.
*  So I think teens are getting very, very creative.
*  We've also seen, unfortunately, parents buying e-cigarettes
*  for their teens.
*  Well, at least they're not smoking cigarettes.
*  That's not the right comparison.
*  So I think they're very creative.
*  They're getting in many, many different ways.
*  I've heard students say,
*  I'm not using my lunch money to buy lunch.
*  I'm gonna use it to buy vapes.
*  There's no one way.
*  There's not.
*  And unfortunately, access is easier than it should.
*  By the way, one thing I think is incredibly important
*  for people to understand is across the US in 2019,
*  December of 2019, the legal age to be allowed to purchase
*  or to sell nicotine products across the US has become 21.
*  So many people think it's still 18.
*  So you go into a vape shop or a tobacco shop
*  and if the shop owner doesn't realize it's 21,
*  they'll sell it to somebody who's 18.
*  And even if they know it's 21, they're still selling it
*  because there's not enforcement right now going on.
*  So we really do need the public.
*  We need all the parents listening.
*  We need educators, police officers to really enforce
*  and regulate this age restriction
*  because teens are getting them from vape shops really easily.
*  They're getting it online really easily.
*  They're buying them for each other.
*  Somebody's going and buying 10 and then reselling them
*  if the person looks older.
*  There's not a lot of carding going on
*  or fake cards, ID cards is pretty easy still to get.
*  So unfortunately we have a product
*  that is appealing to teens
*  in a very unregulated market right now.
*  The FDA is not regulating it.
*  Local shops are not regulating it.
*  That it's just, it is the Wild West out there.
*  So setting aside the issue of whether or not vaping is
*  better for us than smoking cigarettes
*  because that argument is a complicated one to say the least.
*  What do we know about the health hazards of vaping per se?
*  Does it increase lung disease?
*  Does it increase cancer rates?
*  I mean, my understanding is that nicotine,
*  the chemical is not what causes cancer in cigarettes.
*  It's the tars and other things that are consumed
*  or brought into the lungs
*  and therefore bloodstream when one smokes.
*  That's not to say nicotine is safe.
*  I have to be careful here.
*  Sometimes clips get cut and people run wild
*  and I'm not saying nicotine is safe,
*  but what are the problems with vaping nicotine?
*  Even let's just say one or two hits per day,
*  especially in kids.
*  Are there known challenges for brain development?
*  Are there known challenges for cognitive development?
*  Are there known challenges for lung function?
*  I mean, nicotine is a vasoconstrictor
*  and it raises blood pressure.
*  So that's basically stress on the system, chronic stress.
*  But what do we know about what vaping
*  and e-cigarettes are doing to malign health?
*  Yeah, so first of all, start with the brain.
*  And nicotine, absolutely these high levels of nicotine,
*  and really any nicotine is harmful to the developing brain.
*  And our brains continue to develop until we're around 25,
*  24, 26, depending, but to around 25.
*  So in that process of your brain developing
*  or of your brain changing, if you introduce nicotine,
*  you're changing your brain,
*  you're changing the brain chemistry
*  and you're so much more likely to become addicted
*  as an adolescent and a young adult.
*  The tobacco industry knows this.
*  I mean, that's why they target teens.
*  We've noticed with cigarettes, if we target a teen,
*  then we're gonna have them for life.
*  So significantly more likely to become addicted
*  because it actually rewires your brain.
*  And there's plenty of evidence for that.
*  The other pieces that we're worried about is,
*  no, you're right, nicotine in terms of cancer.
*  Although I will tell you,
*  having talked to some oncologists,
*  they would say the vast amount of nicotine
*  still worries them in terms of cancer.
*  We just haven't had enough research
*  on e-cigarettes to really know.
*  Now you're right, e-cigarettes do not have tar,
*  but e-cigarettes have aldehydes
*  and aldehydes have been linked to cancer.
*  So there's still some concern there.
*  There's some early anecdotal evidence
*  and probably some of my colleagues out there would say,
*  no, no, there's pretty good evidence around cancer.
*  We just don't have enough body of research.
*  But again, it took 50 years to figure out cancer
*  in cigarettes.
*  We've not had the amount of e-cigarette use
*  or that we saw with cigarettes for that long,
*  for that many people to really know it's still pretty new.
*  I just might want to just interject that aldehydes,
*  like paraformaldehyde, formaldehyde,
*  these are the same chemicals that we use in laboratories
*  to fix as it's called tissues,
*  to make those tissues firm
*  so that then they can be cut and analyzed
*  under the microscope.
*  Aldehydes cross-link proteins
*  basically change the configuration of proteins
*  and turn what would otherwise be a pliable tissue
*  into kind of a hard rubbery,
*  think of like a dense eraser-like consistency.
*  And in other words,
*  not the configuration most conducive for those cells
*  to live and thrive, actually quite the opposite,
*  which is why that's for sake of doing anatomy on,
*  well, any body part,
*  you use paraformaldehyde, gluteraldehyde,
*  and formaldehyde to cross-link proteins.
*  It basically kills tissue by cross-linking proteins,
*  taking a nice pliable configuration
*  that's amenable to life and twisting the,
*  or shearing the proteins more or less,
*  relative cross-linking them and making them nice and rigid.
*  So if that's happening in the living child,
*  that can't be good.
*  That can't be good. That can't be good.
*  Flugs, bloodstream, everything.
*  And all the aldehydes are carcinogens.
*  Correct. We know they cause cancer.
*  Right, right.
*  And so that's why there's a lot of concern there.
*  And when I talk to teens,
*  and in our curriculum, we often say,
*  because when you just say,
*  and you gave a beautiful explanation of the aldehydes,
*  but for a teenager, what I generally say is,
*  if you ever dissected a,
*  had biology to dissect a frog, yes.
*  How did it smell? It was gross.
*  Well, that's what you're putting into your body
*  when you're vaping, because that's exactly the point.
*  And that kind of helps them understand it a little bit more.
*  But there's a lot of concern around the aldehydes.
*  There's lead, there's cadmium,
*  there's propylene glycol and glycerin.
*  So there's a lot of other chemicals.
*  So no, we may not have the thousands of chemicals
*  that we have in cigarettes,
*  but we certainly have hundreds of chemicals
*  in an e-cigarette. That's very concerning.
*  So there are a lot of studies now
*  really showing pretty significant effects
*  of e-cigarette use on heart and lungs a lot.
*  Not only all the chemicals we've mentioned,
*  but also the flavorants.
*  There's cinnamon aldehyde, another aldehyde.
*  There's vanilla, and there's, what is it?
*  The buttery flavor that's in there is also a lot of concern.
*  So that you're inhaling these flavors,
*  I often explain you can take flavors,
*  you can take butter and heat it to several hundred degrees
*  and eat it if you don't burn your tongue,
*  but you then take it and really inhale the resulting aerosol.
*  And then we're seeing the lesions on the lungs.
*  We're seeing young people who have been using e-cigarettes,
*  having lung collapses, pneumonia,
*  asthma amongst people who have not had seizures.
*  One of the teens I know who was using four pods a day
*  was having seizures.
*  Makes sense because nicotine is a stimulant.
*  Yes.
*  It can cause runaway excitability in the brain
*  if too much is taken.
*  If 40 to 60% of kids are using e-cigarettes
*  and it's destructive to the lungs,
*  and it sounds like the brain as well,
*  where are all the young athletes?
*  Are they the remaining fraction?
*  Yeah, and I should say 40 to 60
*  is what schools are telling me,
*  and that might just be using once in a while.
*  We don't really know.
*  But even kids just like,
*  I had to do PE class when I was in high school.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, we had to run a few laps.
*  I can't imagine doing that
*  if your lungs don't function properly.
*  No, it is actually much harder and teens will say that.
*  And adults I know,
*  I actually know an adult who said that
*  when he went from smoking cigarettes to e-cigarettes,
*  it actually was harder for him to exercise
*  and to ride his bike and exercise
*  and do other things on the e-cigarette
*  compared to the cigarettes,
*  that the impact on the lungs is so strong.
*  So you're right.
*  It is probably hurting athletics right now,
*  where actually there are some curriculums
*  on athletes and vaping,
*  and we're building one as well
*  because there's a lot of concern.
*  When you tell a teen,
*  I'm worried about lung cancer in 20 years.
*  I don't care about 20 years from now,
*  but you would tell a teen it's harder to run,
*  they're more likely to listen to you.
*  I'd like to take a brief break
*  and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Waking Up.
*  Waking Up is a meditation app
*  that offers hundreds of guided meditations,
*  mindfulness trainings, yoga nidra sessions and more.
*  I started meditating over three decades ago.
*  And what I found in the ensuing years
*  is that sometimes it was very easy for me
*  to do my daily meditation practice.
*  I was just really diligent.
*  But then as things would get more stressful,
*  which of course is exactly
*  when I should have been meditating more,
*  my meditation practice would fall off.
*  With Waking Up, they make it very easy to find
*  and consistently use a given meditation practice.
*  It has very convenient reminders
*  and they come in different durations.
*  So even if you just have one minute
*  or five minutes to meditate,
*  you can still get your meditation in,
*  which research shows is still highly beneficial.
*  In addition to the many different meditations
*  on the Waking Up app,
*  they also have yoga nidra sessions,
*  which are a form of non-sleep deep rest
*  that I personally find is extremely valuable
*  for restoring mental and physical vigor.
*  I tend to do a yoga nidra
*  lasting anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes,
*  at least once a day.
*  And if I ever wake up in the middle of the night
*  and I need to fall back asleep,
*  I also find yoga nidra to be extremely useful.
*  If you'd like to try the Waking Up app,
*  you can go to wakingup.com slash Huberman
*  to try a free 30 day trial.
*  Again, that's wakingup.com slash Huberman.
*  We haven't talked too much about peer pressure.
*  They were just social pressure.
*  I remember when I was a kid,
*  it was in the just say no to drugs era.
*  I remember seeing the television commercials with the eggs,
*  like two really beautiful raw eggs.
*  And they'd say, this is your brain.
*  And then it was just your brain on drugs.
*  And it was frying.
*  Nancy Reagan was everywhere in that time.
*  Just say no, just say no.
*  In any case, there must be a lot of data
*  indicating what messages kids respond to.
*  I was told, and I don't know if this is true,
*  but I was told by a researcher
*  that the anti-smoking campaign that was effective in kids
*  was not one that convinced them
*  that smoking was bad for their health,
*  but was one that convinced them
*  that it was their purchasing and use of cigarettes
*  that was making other people rich
*  and then kind of demonizing those people that was effective.
*  Kind of like show the commercials of these guys
*  kind of cackling behind closed doors,
*  making fun of the people that were, in their words,
*  not bright enough to know
*  that they were being taken advantage of.
*  And then that set a kind of a psychological warfare
*  between teens and these people that they perceived
*  as taking advantage of them for money.
*  And that that was effective in getting them to smoke less
*  as opposed to telling them,
*  hey, listen, smoking is really bad for your health.
*  Right, absolutely.
*  So first of all, the just say no, not effective.
*  It's saying just say no around any behavior to a teenager,
*  whether it's tobacco, cannabis, cigarettes, and sex,
*  does not work.
*  It does not work.
*  And for many reasons.
*  First of all, teens are curious.
*  And when you say just say no, why?
*  Well, because it's bad for you.
*  Well, wait a second, exactly what you're saying.
*  Just telling me that it's bad for me.
*  If you tell me I'm gonna get lung cancer
*  or I'm gonna have lung disease or anything,
*  and I tried the e-cigarette
*  and I didn't have lung problems
*  and instead I actually liked it, then we look bad.
*  We look like we're lying to teenagers.
*  And instead, what we were talking about earlier,
*  the feeling, the rush, the flavor, the taste,
*  the perceived and real benefits outweigh the concerns
*  over the risks as a teenager.
*  So when we say to a teen, just say no, don't,
*  they say, well, why?
*  Well, your brain or your heart or your lungs
*  or it's bad for you, they don't believe us.
*  And we absolutely lose credibility.
*  So when we talk to teens,
*  and this is based on decision-making research
*  that I've been doing for 25 years,
*  we have to help teens weigh the benefits and the risk.
*  Now, I don't mean that we say, hey, it's good for you
*  or you're gonna like it, certainly not.
*  But if we only come from a risk model
*  and a just say no model, that never works for teens.
*  We need to help them understand the balance.
*  And teens know that there are good things
*  about using some drugs, real or perceived,
*  and we can't lie to them on that.
*  So that gets to then how do we have those messages?
*  And you're right, if we only harp on,
*  and our research would show this too,
*  the long-term health risks, your brain on drugs,
*  those kinds of things, that's so far in the future
*  are the trach.
*  You're gonna have a trach if you smoke,
*  but they're showing the 80-year-old,
*  and no 16-year-old even looks at somebody at that age
*  or cares about somebody that's so that other person.
*  That's the problem.
*  So we need to talk about the social aspects
*  that teens really care about.
*  You may get wrinkles, although we don't know that
*  so much with e-cigarettes, but the athletics,
*  the things that are important to teens.
*  Now, the campaigns that you're talking about
*  are really effective as well,
*  particularly the mass campaign,
*  which at level that we see social media campaign,
*  which is do you realize that the industry,
*  e-cigarettes, tobacco, nicotine, cigarette,
*  whatever you wanna call it,
*  is targeting you as a teenager on purpose?
*  They want you as a smoker.
*  I used to go to middle school students and say,
*  before e-cigarettes, when cigarettes were of concern,
*  and I love saying to young people,
*  400,000 adults are dying each year from cigarette use.
*  You're a replacement smoker.
*  And it was great, because teens would get really angry
*  and say, wait, this 12-year-old boy was so cute.
*  Wait, I don't wanna be a replacement smoker, Dr. Bonny.
*  It was a big deal to him.
*  And I don't wanna give money to the industry,
*  and it's great.
*  Channel that energy and get young people mad.
*  That's what really worked.
*  Showing that the seven dwarfs, we call it the seven CEOs
*  of the big tobacco companies at the time,
*  said nicotine's not addictive.
*  Our cigarettes are not addictive.
*  And that clearly they were lying to teens.
*  You show that to a teen and explain
*  how nicotine is addictive, and they knew it,
*  but they're trying to get you.
*  Works really well.
*  And same thing with marketing.
*  We have a whole lesson on marketing.
*  Do you think that that candy was for me
*  as a middle-aged adult?
*  It's for you.
*  And that gets them mad, because they don't wanna be duped.
*  They don't wanna be targeted.
*  That is a much better message.
*  Now, we still have to tell them about the health risks.
*  We absolutely do.
*  They still need the knowledge.
*  They still need to understand
*  what they're doing is unhealthy.
*  But we can't do it in a lecturing way,
*  and we can't do it in a way that makes them feel stupid.
*  We can't tell them their brains are developing till 25,
*  and therefore they're dumb.
*  Our lessons on talking about brain are more like,
*  it's really cool that you're developing.
*  It's why you can do dance.
*  That's why you can sing better.
*  You can learn language.
*  There's so much that you could do that's really cool
*  that I can't do right now.
*  But because of that, that's why you're so much more likely
*  to become addicted, and the industry knew that.
*  That's why they're targeting you.
*  Those are the messages that work a lot better for teens.
*  Sounds like the key is to never undervalue
*  the spirit of defiance in youth,
*  and perhaps to wager it
*  against these clearly destructive behaviors.
*  To be honest, I'm shocked that there's so much vape use
*  and e-cigarette use.
*  These numbers are staggering.
*  Maybe we could weave in a discussion about cannabis.
*  Sure.
*  I did an episode about cannabis.
*  The landscape around cannabis has changed so much
*  since I was a kid.
*  It was highly illegal, at least where I grew up.
*  Now, I think it's been decriminalized certain places,
*  still illegal elsewhere.
*  I don't want anyone getting in trouble
*  as a consequence of not understanding
*  what the law is in their area.
*  And outright legal, pretty easy to get
*  in a lot of the country.
*  And it's not clear that at least with individual use,
*  that it's being punished nearly as frequently
*  as it used to be.
*  So the 10-word summary of the cannabis thing
*  is that the ratio of THC to CBD is important.
*  It is true that a lot of cannabis has much, much higher
*  levels of THC now than in the past,
*  although I'm told that high THC level cannabis always existed.
*  But it seems to be the concentration of THC
*  that is of, let's just say concern,
*  as it relates to the potential development of psychosis,
*  if there's a predisposition,
*  as in terms of how addictive the cannabis is,
*  and so on and so forth.
*  Which is not to say that CBD is totally innocuous,
*  but it seems to be like the THC concentration
*  is the kind of the thing to mainly focus on.
*  So what do we know about cannabis?
*  And here, we're going to assume cannabis
*  with a reasonable to high level of THC in it,
*  so not pure CBD.
*  What do we know about vaping and e-cig use
*  of cannabis specifically?
*  Is it true that youth that are taking nicotine
*  by way of vape or e-cigarette,
*  then transition into using cannabis?
*  Is it sort of a gateway into cannabis use?
*  And how prevalent is cannabis use in kids age 10 to 21?
*  First of all, you're right.
*  I mean, THC levels we're seeing today's joint
*  is about 10 joints when I was a teen.
*  So the dramatic increases in the potency right now
*  that we're seeing around THC,
*  and then you get something like dabbing,
*  which is about 80% THC versus 20 to 30%
*  of the more mainstream products that we have in the market.
*  When I say mainstream, I mean like joints or e-cigarettes.
*  So the potency has gone up dramatically
*  and it is of concern.
*  So depending on the study,
*  you're going to see anywhere from 10 to 20% of teens
*  is saying that they're using some form of cannabis,
*  either smoked or in the form of a joint or a blunt.
*  And for those who don't know a blunt,
*  a lot of people don't realize is a combination
*  of both tobacco and cannabis.
*  So it's a cigar leaf or some people buy a cigar
*  and pull out the tobacco and put in the cannabis,
*  or they'll just get the cigar leaf
*  and roll the cannabis flower.
*  Then you're getting both the kind of the double whammy
*  and the chaser, the high of both of nicotine and THC.
*  So we're seeing a fair number of,
*  it's interesting, even though teens are not smoking cigarettes,
*  they're still using joints, which is interesting,
*  but very quickly increasing is e-cigarettes
*  with cannabis in there.
*  You could buy a cannabis style e-cigarettes,
*  and that's been around for a long time
*  with volcano vaporizers and specific cannabis vaporizers.
*  That's not new, but it's become much, much more popular.
*  But now we're also seeing teens buy a nicotine e-cigarette,
*  inhale half of it and then add the cannabis wax or oil to it,
*  and then basically get the combination.
*  I had one young teenager, probably 12, 13, 14 year old,
*  young man who said, yeah, I got a cherry nicotine vape
*  and I inhaled half of it.
*  He probably didn't use the word inhale,
*  but I used half of it.
*  And then I added in some cannabis oil,
*  and now I had a cherry flavored cannabis nicotine device.
*  So we're seeing that more and more.
*  And even though you're not technically supposed to,
*  and the manufacturers of nicotin-e-cigarettes will say,
*  don't open them and add stuff,
*  a simple YouTube video will teach you how to do it.
*  And unfortunately, the videos are not using gloves
*  and benzoic acid is covering your skin
*  and things like that.
*  But- Which is bad for-
*  Which is bad.
*  Does it go transdermally?
*  Does it go through the skin?
*  It supposedly it does, yeah.
*  But if the benzoic acid is going transdermally,
*  presumably when one inhales off one of these pods,
*  they're also bringing benzoic acid into the lungs.
*  Correct.
*  And hopefully people realize this
*  from our episodes on breathing,
*  but if not, I'll just make it clear now
*  that when you breathe in a substance,
*  you know, a airborne substance into your lungs,
*  because of the interface between the vasculature,
*  the blood supply and the lungs,
*  I mean, basically things pass from the lungs
*  into the blood supply very, very readily.
*  Very quickly.
*  And then if those things are able,
*  they'll cross the blood brain barrier.
*  Correct. Yeah.
*  Correct.
*  And it only takes about seven to 10 seconds
*  to go through the whole system and into the brain too.
*  So it's a very fast process.
*  So teenagers are definitely vaping
*  or using cannabis e-cigarettes.
*  And the problem is, you know,
*  for one teens will think it's healthier than
*  just like nicotine e-cigarettes,
*  they think it's healthier than combustible.
*  I mean, yes, you're not burning it,
*  but you're still inhaling and you still are inhaling.
*  There seems to be the propylene glycol, the glycerin,
*  the flavorants, all the aldehydes,
*  even if it's just a cannabis e-cigarette.
*  So there's a lot of concern there.
*  And then addiction is still huge.
*  It's a huge issue when you're talking about cannabis,
*  the same reasons that we talked about with nicotine,
*  the brain development and so on.
*  Psychosis, just a lot to think about here.
*  Psychosis.
*  There's actually some scientists now
*  who are really strongly saying it's not associated
*  with cause or cause or cause.
*  That if you are predetermined to have a mental health issue,
*  psychosis, schizophrenia, then starting to use
*  or using cannabis can actually trigger
*  and cause you to become psychotic.
*  I don't totally understand the mechanism yet.
*  I don't think we totally do yet,
*  but that there seems to be more than just,
*  eh, it might happen.
*  And it seems to be right in that older adolescent,
*  young adult timeframe that it is happening.
*  Around the same time that the brain's developing
*  and we're hardwiring the rest of our brain
*  that that change is happening
*  from a neuronal connection perspective.
*  My understanding, sorry to interrupt,
*  but my understanding is that indeed
*  the use of high THC cannabis in youth,
*  in particular male youth, predisposes,
*  and you're saying might even be causal
*  toward the development of psychotic symptoms
*  in late teens, early twenties.
*  Correct.
*  And that some of those cases
*  are ones in which the psychosis is irreversible.
*  Correct.
*  Is it sometimes the case that somebody
*  exhibits psychotic symptoms as the consequence
*  of using THC and the psychotic symptoms resolve?
*  Or is it some sort of circuit switch
*  that is then permanent?
*  You know, it's a good question.
*  I honestly don't really know the answer to that
*  of what percentage.
*  The few cases I know of in talking to the psychiatrist
*  would say that it's causal and it may be permanent.
*  No, it could be managed.
*  It doesn't mean that somebody is going to be having
*  psychotic episodes all the time.
*  I mean, it certainly can be managed.
*  And certainly we would say,
*  please don't continue to use, would be very important.
*  But whether it's completely reversible
*  is something that I'm not sure of.
*  Somebody more versed in this.
*  But what you do in your research
*  and what I know is, you know,
*  changes to the neural circuitry is not changeable.
*  You know, when we hurt our brain cells,
*  that is not something that we could recover from.
*  So that is very much concerning.
*  Yeah, as adults, there are very few new neurons
*  added to the brain.
*  There is significant plasticity and recovery of function
*  in some cases, both by virtue of traumatic brain injury.
*  Certainly people can get over certain behavioral patterns
*  and that no doubt involves plasticity, but it takes work.
*  And when it comes to addiction,
*  there's evidence that some of the reward circuitry
*  can adjust, but again, it takes adherence to specific things
*  in order to make that happen.
*  I'm very concerned about this
*  potentially causal relationship,
*  but certainly correlation between
*  high THC containing cannabis and psychosis,
*  mostly because we already have a serious problem
*  with psychosis on the planet.
*  A lot of people don't realize that, you know,
*  approximately 1% of the world's population has schizophrenia.
*  And by the way, I have to be careful with the language.
*  Nowadays, you know, has schizophrenia or is schizophrenic
*  or all that language gets murky,
*  but meet the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia,
*  I think is a safe way to put it.
*  So if one is then adding to that number of people exhibiting
*  and suffering from psychotic symptoms,
*  that prevent them from having functional work lives, etc.
*  That's an issue.
*  How difficult is it for these adolescents and teens
*  to quit vaping and e-cigarettes and cannabis?
*  I mean, can they quit just by deciding?
*  Are there programs?
*  Are they all going into, you know, recovery programs?
*  Are there recovery programs in schools?
*  I mean, how successful are they in stopping?
*  It's really difficult.
*  And maybe I'll talk about nicotine first.
*  And the same would be true for cannabis,
*  but a little bit less extent.
*  I mean, both are addictive.
*  And interestingly, not a lot of people realize
*  that cannabis is addictive.
*  And about one in six teens or people who are using,
*  particularly under the age of 25, do become addicted.
*  They don't realize that it's addictive.
*  They don't realize it's addictive.
*  The argument I often heard was, it's not as bad as alcohol,
*  which is kind of a lame argument.
*  I understand why people default to that,
*  but I mean, getting hit by a car might not be as bad
*  as getting hit by a train.
*  But I wouldn't even look at that analogy as accurate.
*  There's just different levels of destructive,
*  different types of destructive.
*  Yeah, these not as bad as blank
*  doesn't really seem to work.
*  No, no.
*  And, you know, I often say, people say,
*  well, why'd you start studying tobacco?
*  I mean, there is no safe level of tobacco use, period.
*  Yes, we have very few 30-year-olds
*  who suddenly pick up a cigarette and become addicted.
*  You know, at that point, your development of your brain.
*  Now, if you use regularly,
*  are you still gonna hurt your lungs and heart
*  and stuff like that?
*  Absolutely.
*  The brain changes may not be there in the same way.
*  But most people don't pick up a cigarette or an A cigarette
*  for the first time in their 30s or 40s and on.
*  So absolutely, it's addictive.
*  And it is probably the most difficult to quit
*  drug that's out there.
*  Whereas alcohol, we don't see, I mean, yes,
*  we have alcoholism.
*  I'm not downplaying that.
*  It's a huge issue in this country.
*  It's a huge issue on this planet.
*  But you're not gonna have people in two weeks,
*  three weeks suddenly say, I'm addicted to alcohol.
*  You are going to with nicotine
*  and you are with cannabis to some extent as well.
*  So yes, nicotine is incredibly addictive.
*  And we have so many teens who are addictive,
*  addicted to nicotine through e-cigarettes
*  and really struggling to get off of it.
*  I gave a talk recently to a group of parents
*  and they said, this is all great information, Bonnie,
*  but how do I help my kid?
*  And I just felt awful because there's not a lot
*  that we have.
*  So taking a few different things.
*  First of all, we don't have,
*  there are some programs, there are inpatient programs,
*  absolutely showing some positive.
*  Inpatient programs.
*  There are actually some inpatient programs.
*  But those are gonna be expensive or require
*  that people have insurance that will cover that.
*  Absolutely, and they take weeks.
*  And then you're taking a young person
*  out of their natural environment,
*  out of their school, out of their friends, stigmatizing,
*  which hopefully we're not stigmatizing drug use anyway,
*  but you take a young person at 12, 14, 16,
*  you put them in another place,
*  that's very difficult on them.
*  And if part of why they're using in the first place
*  is stress, you're just enhancing that.
*  Outpatient programs, we have some things,
*  but the problem is we don't have the best recommendations
*  because we don't have great research.
*  So for example, Nectarine Replacement Therapy, the patch.
*  First of all, it's not authorized for use by the FDA,
*  it's not been approved by the FDA for anybody under 18.
*  And yet we have a lot of teenagers who are addicted.
*  We just don't have the right studies
*  and they haven't gone to the FDA for that approval.
*  Now, a lot of doctors are using nicotine patches
*  and prescribing them for somebody under 18,
*  it's considered off label, but you still can do it.
*  And most people would recommend it.
*  The problem is, and I don't mean problem with using them,
*  I have no problem with, and I've often suggested to,
*  I don't treat, I wanna make sure that
*  I'm not misquoted there either,
*  I don't directly treat and see patients myself,
*  but based on the evidence
*  and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations,
*  we should be using a patch with those under 18.
*  But then the question is how much?
*  If a nicotine patch is about 21 milligrams of nicotine
*  and a teenager's using 40 milligrams in a day,
*  do you give two patches?
*  And I've had some doctors say,
*  wow, that's a lot of nicotine.
*  I say, well, they're using a lot of nicotine.
*  What I've heard some, my adolescent medicine colleagues
*  have suggested is one patch and then supplement with gums
*  and suckers and lozenges.
*  Not as a starting, I don't mean like what we're seeing
*  with some pouches out there like Zin, as a starter.
*  I don't mean that, I mean as a form of treatment.
*  As a way to wean them off?
*  As a way to.
*  So reducing the dosage over time?
*  Correct, correct.
*  And now, but then they also don't have the hand to mouth
*  piece that we see that is difficult.
*  So gum, in this case, I mean non-nicotine gum,
*  just chewing regular gum.
*  I've heard teenagers say that their withdrawal
*  lasts three to four minutes.
*  So they have a, one teenager said,
*  I have a playlist on my phone
*  that's each song is three to four minutes.
*  And when I start to feel the withdrawal,
*  I pop the music in my ears and I go do something
*  and I listen to the song and by then
*  that uncomfortable feeling is over.
*  I've heard teens say that they'll run,
*  that there's many different things that they'll do.
*  Chewing on a toothpick, not a nicotine toothpick,
*  but just a toothpick.
*  Other ways to really get their mind off of that feeling
*  is really important.
*  But we also have to know with adults and cigarettes,
*  it can take seven to 11 tries.
*  So we can't expect, until they're fully off of a cigarette,
*  can't expect a teenager to quit overnight.
*  Especially with the social pressure.
*  And again, sorry to interrupt,
*  but I think that the seven to 11 tries,
*  did an episode on nicotine
*  and I talked about smoking a bit and most people fail.
*  Most people fail.
*  They relapse.
*  It's very, very difficult to quit smoking.
*  People that do it and stick to it
*  are real heroes of the process.
*  It's not easy, but that's with a heavy incentive,
*  immediate health issues, sometimes it's financial, et cetera.
*  With kids, it feels like all the pressures
*  are pushing in the opposite direction
*  because it's socially rewarded.
*  They get that elevation of mood and focus
*  and there's just oh so much driving them
*  to continue using.
*  Absolutely right.
*  One of the things that we do in our program
*  to help teens quit is we talk about social withdrawal.
*  And it was actually one of our,
*  we have a wonderful group of 40 youth who work with us.
*  We call it our Youth Action Board, our YAB,
*  our ReachLab YAB.
*  Our YABs say that we need to talk about social withdrawal,
*  not just physical because of exactly what you're talking
*  about, they may not be able to go to that party
*  on a Saturday night where they know their friends are vaping
*  because it'll, and we know the brain queues up
*  that they'll see or smell or witness somebody
*  using an e-cigarette and those queues will happen
*  and they'll want to use it.
*  So they actually have to isolate themselves
*  from their friend group who was using.
*  So it's very difficult.
*  So really setting up your social milieu,
*  really setting up your friends who are not using,
*  really trying to talk and have your family around you.
*  And I really tell parents, it's not the time
*  to get pissed off with your kids for using,
*  it's the time to really help them.
*  Let's be in this together.
*  And often I say the reason why they're using
*  is that they're fault.
*  Let's go back to the beginning of our conversation
*  about marketing and that they're being targeted.
*  And teens didn't even know what was hitting them,
*  what was going on.
*  So let's not be mad at them, let's be sympathetic and help.
*  So they need the combination of nicotine replacement,
*  they need to change their milieu,
*  they need to have healthy snacks and water and exercise
*  and all kinds of things around them.
*  And they may also need cognitive behavioral therapy
*  or some other therapy to really get them.
*  It's not gonna be a one stop.
*  We need to work with them.
*  And that's the same with cannabis, by the way.
*  This is just any drugs and just feels so bad.
*  It is such a problem right now.
*  When we built our curriculums,
*  same thing I said I was doing middle and high school
*  and never thought I'd do elementary
*  and we have an elementary curriculum.
*  I thought I was only gonna do prevention.
*  We now have intervention and moving towards cessation.
*  That's how many young people are just struggling right now.
*  When I was in high school,
*  there seemed to be a phenomenon of certain behaviors
*  allowed kids to have some social clout
*  by virtue of, I guess they used to call it holding.
*  Like if someone had weed or if somebody,
*  yeah, if they had weed,
*  then it sort of gave them a position in the social structure.
*  Oftentimes the kids that,
*  I mean, I was friendly and knew most people
*  in my high school class.
*  And a few of them were kind of like
*  less socially engaged than others.
*  But then at some point midway through high school,
*  one of them was like start showing up with weed
*  at parties or something.
*  And suddenly like they had like a social clout.
*  It was kind of interesting to see how,
*  having paraphernalia, having nicotine or cannabis
*  or whatever it is,
*  is sort of, I think has long been a kind of like
*  an instant sort of route to inserting oneself
*  into a social structure, which is obviously unhealthy.
*  I'm not promoting this.
*  And then it is social, right?
*  That there's sort of an instant substrate for communication.
*  When I was growing up, I worked at a skateboard shop
*  and on my break, I would go behind the shop.
*  There's a little alley there, we'd skateboard.
*  There's this little bump.
*  But occasionally like employees would share a cigarette
*  or you'd ask someone for a cigarette.
*  This was kind of a way of bridging social gaps.
*  So again, I feel like it's so hard to be a teenager.
*  There's so much going on internally and externally.
*  And everything you're talking about,
*  in terms of the negative health effects,
*  the paraphernalia, the marketing, the taste,
*  the addictive qualities of it, et cetera,
*  just start to pile on all these challenges
*  to staying away from it.
*  But a big one seems to be the kind of instant social cred
*  that one gets when they participate in something
*  that other people are participating in.
*  Because for instance, like a sport,
*  there's a pickup basketball game.
*  You have to play reasonably well to get into the game.
*  Otherwise it's not gonna be easy
*  or you have to be very bold, right?
*  So unless you're engaged in a sport, you're in theater,
*  you're doing other things, it's sort of an instant route.
*  Okay, I think I've made my point.
*  Is there anything about that that by way of understanding
*  can help create like replacement behaviors?
*  I mean, it's gonna be hard to take a kid
*  whose entire life is hanging out with their friends
*  and vaping cannabis or nicotine after school
*  and hanging around and playing on their phone and saying,
*  hey, listen, you're gonna quit vaping nicotine.
*  You're gonna feel worse.
*  Your friends are all gonna be doing it
*  and you'll still be their friend,
*  but you're not really part of it.
*  It's almost like you have to create a culture of quitting
*  before this can really go the other direction.
*  You do.
*  And what you're saying is so correct and so relevant
*  and why I feel so bad for teens right now
*  and the social media, right?
*  You put that in there as well
*  and it's all over the place right now.
*  With them, they're bombarded by all of the different factors
*  that you talked about.
*  And it was interesting,
*  we were talking about earlier around the social aspects too.
*  I was thinking there was a point where it was so cool,
*  particularly around Joel, it was so cool to Joel
*  that I had teens come up to me and say,
*  Dr. Bonnie, do you have a fake e-cigarette?
*  And I said, a fake e-cigarette?
*  Well, yeah, all my friends are using
*  and I don't want to, but I wanna fake it.
*  And I just felt so bad and I said,
*  well, I'm not gonna get you a fake e-cigarette,
*  but I will help you with refusal skills
*  and teach you how to say no, but in this case,
*  not just say no, but teach you how to feel good
*  about saying no to certain things
*  that you don't wanna be doing.
*  And during that time, it was very difficult for teens
*  to come up and say, I either wanna quit
*  or I don't wanna be a user, I just don't wanna start
*  because that was not cool.
*  I think we've changed in the last couple years, thankfully.
*  I think there are more teens who are not using,
*  who are open to it or who are open to quitting.
*  A lot of teens wanna quit right now.
*  So thankfully, we're in a new era where the,
*  yes, the pressures to use are absolutely there,
*  but there's starting to be a tide change
*  where we're getting more teens who are getting
*  on the so-called bandwagon to either quit or not use.
*  I think the social supports are being there
*  a lot more than we've ever seen before.
*  We have more youth groups who are getting on board
*  of either trying to help quit or trying to make sure
*  that it's okay not to use.
*  It's still hard and what you're talking about.
*  So it's our job as adults and healthcare providers
*  and community partners and educators to really talk
*  to young people to set up those social groups
*  and say, it's okay not to use.
*  It's okay to come on over to this group and yeah,
*  maybe you're not gonna be with that same social group
*  on Saturday night.
*  Let's start a new social group for you.
*  I'm not saying it's easy.
*  This is not easy for young people and it's not easy.
*  Parents are struggling too.
*  They're struggling to know how to talk to their teenagers,
*  but this is what we have to work towards
*  and setting up those social networks of it's cool not to use.
*  One of the other things by the way that we talk about
*  is the environment.
*  When we talk to teens about not using
*  and why it's bad for them, heart, lungs, et cetera,
*  and all the things and being duped and be marketed to
*  and the money, the environment piece
*  has also been interesting.
*  Teens right now may not care about their hearts,
*  their lungs 20 years from now,
*  but they care about the environment
*  and there are environmental aspects to these.
*  The plastics, the pods don't disappear.
*  The benzoylg acid does not evaporate
*  and we've got secondhand vapor, secondhand smoke,
*  secondhand and thirdhand.
*  So what I mean by that is if I were to use an e-cigarette
*  near you, you would actually get a lot of the volatile
*  organic chemicals, a lot of the nicotine is in the air.
*  Actually some studies suggest COVID might even be
*  in those droplets.
*  There's a lot of issues there.
*  And then thirdhand is it just doesn't dissipate
*  that vapor, aerosol, it's not a vapor,
*  that aerosol then settles into carpets and clothes and so on.
*  And this is toxic to pets, to children, things like that.
*  So when we talk to teens about that,
*  that's another way to get young people to be willing
*  to either quit or to rally around not using
*  is the environment.
*  You know, if I wash dishes for too long,
*  my younger is out of the house, but when she comes over,
*  I get yelled across the room, mom, turn the water off,
*  the environment, we have to save water.
*  That's what they care about so much that if we could
*  at least get that into young people's hands,
*  say, you know what, you may not care about yourself,
*  but what about your friends and what about the environment?
*  I think we can also shift some of the generation right now.
*  Interesting, yeah, I think replacement behaviors,
*  concern for the environment seem like good incentives.
*  I don't know, I'm hearing all this,
*  I feel really lucky that I was always obsessed
*  with something growing up, whether or not it was like birds
*  and fish tanks or skateboarding or prior to that, soccer,
*  or you know, I mean, certainly there were drugs
*  and alcohol around, but there were always activities
*  that kept us busy.
*  And I guess I wonder whether or not the advent
*  of social media has created less interest in activities,
*  I mean, you know, after school activities,
*  I guess they used to call them, but I mean,
*  even if it's video games, if it's playing a sport,
*  if it's theater, if it's art, if it's music,
*  presumably kids are still doing all that stuff,
*  but is it the case that the kids that are vaping,
*  let's say nicotine, maybe cannabis as well,
*  are less likely to be engaged in other activities?
*  I mean, is this thing becoming just kind of a closed loop
*  of reward?
*  I mean, that's to me the real danger of any substance
*  that increases the dopamine system activation
*  without a lot of effort, right?
*  Because as you and I know that the whole of dopamine circuitry
*  as it relates to reward is all about effort,
*  reward, reinforcement, effort reward reinforcement.
*  But the effort piece is key and drugs basically bypass
*  the effort piece and then you get the reward reinforcement
*  and then eventually the rewarding and reinforcing levels
*  of return on that drug, nicotine, cannabis, et cetera,
*  diminishes and then you're just caught in a behavioral loop.
*  Right, right, absolutely.
*  So, you know, are kids doing less stuff?
*  Are they studying less as a consequence of this?
*  Are they playing fewer sports?
*  Are they less engaged in youth theater and music
*  and youth groups and things like that?
*  When we were talking about cigarettes,
*  when I first started my career up until probably 2014,
*  I would say, yes, you're absolutely correct.
*  And it was generally the teens who would say I'm bored
*  and I didn't know what to do with myself
*  and that's why I picked up cigarettes
*  or I'm not an athlete or this was my social outlet.
*  I haven't seen that as a result as much with e-cigarettes.
*  Now, as a result of e-cigarettes, yes,
*  but not as a cause of using because it's so ubiquitous.
*  E-cigarettes we're seeing everywhere.
*  It doesn't matter if you're how old you are, male, female,
*  used to be more males using because some of the earlier
*  devices were more tech and guys were using it
*  and some of the females didn't want to put them
*  in their person because they would leak.
*  We now are seeing more of an equal rate,
*  if not a little bit more female using.
*  It's not your so-called bad or good kids.
*  It's not anything, it's not the young people
*  who are struggling with school.
*  It's everywhere right now, independent of location,
*  race, ethnicity, things like that.
*  So I don't see so much what you're talking about
*  in terms of a predictor.
*  In terms of a result, absolutely.
*  I mean, then we're seeing teens who become more isolated,
*  who are not engaged as much, who are more bored
*  because they're sitting home and they're vaping.
*  But I also see a lot of young people
*  sitting around together vaping.
*  So I do think that that landscape has changed.
*  Is it gonna change back?
*  I don't know, as hopefully we change the culture again.
*  But it's an interesting thought.
*  I mean, as soon as you said that, I was thinking,
*  yeah, I mean, they're certainly not out as much
*  as they used to be in terms of,
*  and we were talking about this at the beginning,
*  we're not seeing them out in parks as much.
*  We're not seeing them playing pickup sports games
*  as much as we used to.
*  But I don't think that's because of, it's a great use.
*  I think that's because of social media
*  and just the whole change.
*  And honestly, parents being afraid of letting their kids out
*  for some predatory behavior in other ways.
*  You mean if kids are let out of the house,
*  they're more at risk to predatory behavior?
*  But of course they're also at risk
*  but just by use of the phone
*  because the phone connects everywhere.
*  Absolutely, the phone connects everywhere.
*  And that's something we try to teach teens as well.
*  But I think that that's been something
*  that parents are worried about.
*  I have to say, almost the pendulum almost swung too much
*  of now I have to keep my kid in
*  because I don't want to let them out of the house
*  and I don't want to let them alone driving
*  and alone at the park and things like that.
*  But I think that we've reduced,
*  you were talking earlier about autonomy,
*  we've reduced teens just autonomy.
*  They have to get into a little bit of trouble.
*  They have to jaywalk, they have to do,
*  I mean, I'm not encouraging.
*  But there's some natural amount of getting together
*  and hanging out and being crazy at the park
*  and playing games and things like that.
*  And I think that has stopped or slowed down a lot.
*  I see it with some people in my own community.
*  I don't see as much just hanging out in the front yard
*  and shooting the breeze and instead they're inside
*  and they're on their phones and stuff like that.
*  So could that be part of why we're seeing
*  more e-cigarette use?
*  Possibly, I just don't have,
*  I haven't seen the studies on it.
*  Yeah, perhaps that's a good segue into risky behaviors.
*  When I was a kid, I mean, the dumb stuff that we did,
*  meaning dumb because it was dangerous to ourselves.
*  I mean, I am not suggesting people do this,
*  kids, please don't do this, just don't.
*  But just the dumb stuff of, you know,
*  jumping off roofs or between roofs.
*  I'm not gonna give any other, any anecdotes,
*  just it's amazing that we all survived.
*  And some didn't, but that was largely the consequence
*  of drugs, alcohol, mental health issues of kids I knew.
*  But car accidents, actually I grew up in the,
*  in the mothers against drunk driving era
*  and there was a real discouragement around drunk driving.
*  I was fortunate that at least in high school,
*  most of my friends didn't drink or didn't drink much.
*  But you still heard about fatalities in kids happen.
*  Even one is too many, obviously.
*  What's going on now in terms of risk-taking behavior,
*  driving fast, driving drunk,
*  doing what used to be just described as dumb stuff
*  that unfortunately sometimes is fatal
*  or results in paralysis, people jumping off bridges
*  into water without testing the water depth.
*  We've all heard the stories and sadly,
*  they're true stories of people becoming paralyzed,
*  that kind of thing.
*  Dumb stuff, dangerous stuff, teens do more of it.
*  Is it still true that males are doing more of that,
*  physical danger stuff than females or is that not true?
*  That's what we used to hear.
*  But then of course, there's been this big push importantly,
*  really to balance out the amount of research on both sexes.
*  Yeah, it's a good point.
*  I mean, some of it has to do with just the methods
*  of our research to know, you know, it's interesting.
*  I haven't seen more recent data in terms of differences
*  by sex of risk engagement or risk behavior.
*  I mean, a lot of what I've seen is balanced out.
*  I think it's maybe different kinds of risk behaviors
*  that people do, but we're still seeing it.
*  We're still seeing teens drinking.
*  We're still seeing teens going to parties and getting drunk.
*  We're still seeing teens out on the beach and getting drunk.
*  I think the big difference now is whether it's
*  from mothers against now, I think it's destructive driving.
*  Is that what it's called?
*  I think it's now mothers against.
*  Destructive driving.
*  I think that's what it is.
*  So that includes drunk driving and racing.
*  And racing and driving under the influence of cannabis
*  or anything else, which can be harmful.
*  But at least in a lot of the teens and young adults
*  I've talked to, at least we've gotten that word out to teens.
*  So they're still drinking and they're still doing stupid
*  stuff when they drink, but they're not getting behind
*  the wheel as much, much less.
*  And this idea of a designated driver or a sober driver.
*  Uber.
*  Or Uber.
*  Uber's really changed. Or Lyft, I guess we should be fair.
*  Or any ride share, let's just say any ride share
*  has certainly been a game changer in the landscape
*  of teenagers and young adults right now.
*  And in fact, I've heard not just a designated driver
*  but a designated partner or a sober sitter.
*  So this idea that you go to a party
*  and there may be drinking going on,
*  but you make sure that there's one person who's sober,
*  not just for driving, but to make sure you're not going home
*  with somebody you don't want to go home with.
*  To make sure that you're not leaving drunk
*  and falling down stairs.
*  To make sure that you're not falling out of that window.
*  So that message we've gotten across really well,
*  which I'm thrilled about.
*  Are we still seeing drunk driving in accidents?
*  I certainly have among some people I know.
*  Certainly we are, but I think that the message overall
*  has gotten out there.
*  Some people I've talked to said,
*  we just don't get behind the wheel, period.
*  What's also interesting is more and more teens
*  are not driving.
*  They're delaying driving more and more.
*  Whether that's because of Uber lift.
*  I mean, it's, as a parent, it's less expensive
*  to pay for a ride share than to pay for insurance
*  for somebody under 25 or to pay for a car.
*  So certainly that might be it.
*  But that is there.
*  Doing other stupid stuff, I mean, in addition to drugs,
*  jumping, skateboarding, certainly we're still seeing that.
*  Well, skateboarding is a good sport.
*  You gotta, don't exceed your skill level,
*  but jumping between buildings, not smart,
*  unless you're super skilled and know what you're doing.
*  I mean, you know, there are the parkour kids
*  and the skateboard kids and the BMX,
*  because we don't wanna take away
*  what the incredible things that they can do,
*  but there's risk there.
*  I was referring to people who lack the skill
*  to complete the maneuver and getting badly hurt,
*  or in some cases, not getting badly hurt,
*  but you just kind of shake your head and wonder
*  why you ever engaged in that kind of stuff.
*  Just so risky.
*  Yeah, yeah, we're definitely still seeing
*  risk behavior amongst teenagers,
*  and part of it has to do with impulsivity.
*  We know that teens up until around,
*  part of the development of cognitive and psychosocial
*  and social development is up until around 16, 17,
*  they're still very impulsive.
*  We know with the brain development,
*  the back of the brain develops faster and first,
*  and that's our amygdala, our emotional center,
*  our motor coordination versus the front of the brain,
*  which is our executive functioning,
*  our planning for the future are really slowing down
*  and being able to think of the risks and benefits
*  and make those decisions a little slower
*  and a little bit better, more like we would as adults.
*  So we certainly see impulsive decision,
*  hey, let's go TP that house, or let's go ride on that car,
*  or let's go do things that probably,
*  hopefully wouldn't get them killed or injured,
*  but may get them busted in other ways.
*  We're still seeing that.
*  I think there have been more programs to help teens
*  sort of rehearse in situations so they're not,
*  in more life skills training,
*  so they're not making some of those impulsive decisions,
*  but teens will, teens are gonna be teens,
*  which by the way is why we don't put things in front of them
*  like sugar booger and unicorn kind of marketing
*  that's going to get teens attractive
*  because that is buying into that knee jerk,
*  impulsive, it looks cool,
*  everyone's doing a kind of thing that they can't resist.
*  I don't mean that they can't,
*  but just buys right into teens are going to be teens
*  and that's what they're gonna do.
*  What about sexual behavior?
*  You mentioned that kids are driving less,
*  or getting their driver's license less frequently,
*  which by the way, with respect to teens wanting to drive less,
*  that just like baffles my mind.
*  I mean, one of the reasons I like skateboarding as a sport
*  is you could do it anywhere.
*  It was also transportation and I liked the social,
*  I loved the social milieu of it.
*  But getting my driver's license
*  was like one of the most important events of my life.
*  Me too, me too.
*  I could drive to Yosemite in the summer,
*  I could do all sorts of things with that.
*  I'm so surprised that kids wouldn't want to do that.
*  Such autonomy there, so much fun.
*  Oh, I agree.
*  But I've also heard that rates of sexual behavior
*  are going down, is that true?
*  Yeah, stabilizing and going down.
*  And certainly rates of risky sexual behavior
*  has also gone down.
*  So we are getting the message across around condom use,
*  around STI testing, around birth control,
*  things like that, which is also really good.
*  But rates overall have gone down.
*  Is teen pregnancy down?
*  I think it's down.
*  Actually, I haven't looked at the latest numbers.
*  I think it's down.
*  Certainly, I don't think it's gone up.
*  But I actually would need to look back at those numbers.
*  It's been a little while since I've looked at them.
*  And is what we're talking about today
*  mostly within the United States and the United States alone,
*  or is it carryover to other countries as well?
*  So it totally depends on the behavior
*  that we're talking about.
*  Let's say vaping or e-cig use of cannabis or nicotine.
*  So interestingly, e-cigarette nicotine, e-cigarette use
*  has not been as high in a lot of other countries.
*  It depends on the country.
*  But for example, the UK or Europe,
*  we haven't seen the rates as high in the last few years.
*  Part of it was that a lot of other states
*  have a nicotine standard.
*  So that means a minimum amount, or maximum amount,
*  excuse me, of nicotine that you're allowed to have.
*  So for example, the UK, I think it's around 1.7%.
*  In the US, we have no nicotine standard,
*  which is another major issue with regulation.
*  We have, as I was saying, 5%, 10% nicotine levels.
*  There is no regulation about how much nicotine
*  that you could have.
*  So in certain countries, if it's right around
*  the addictive level or a little bit below it,
*  we're gonna see fewer teens becoming addictive.
*  It's still bad at any amount,
*  but we're gonna see fewer people becoming addictive.
*  The other is the marketing was not as big in other countries
*  and really was the marketing was e-cigarettes
*  if you're trying to stop smoking cigarettes
*  not marketed to teens.
*  That has changed in the last year or two.
*  So in countries I've talked to, for example, the UK,
*  I've been interviewed by them many times in the last few years
*  and they would say, we don't have the same problem.
*  And now they're saying, boy, we are seeing
*  a pretty significant increase in the number of teens
*  who are using.
*  Part of it is a different landscape
*  of the kind of e-cigarette that's out there,
*  the kind of marketing that's out there, whatever it is,
*  we are now seeing, is it as high as we have in the US?
*  I don't think so, but it's certainly increasing.
*  Same thing in other countries where they actually
*  didn't allow certain e-cigarettes to be on the market,
*  have now come in and been on the market and infiltrated.
*  And even in this country, certain e-cigarettes are illegal
*  and they're coming in illegally through illicit trading
*  is happening and crossing the borders.
*  So e-cigarette, we're still seeing.
*  Cannabis depends on the country, right,
*  whether it's legal or not.
*  Now, even in the US, I should say,
*  even states that have legalized cannabis,
*  you have to be 21, but we're still seeing
*  underage cannabis use, of course,
*  just like we're seeing underage drinking
*  and underage nicotine use.
*  In other states where it's just really difficult to get,
*  we're not seeing cannabis as much,
*  but we still are seeing it.
*  We didn't talk about things like Zin pouches,
*  which are becoming more popular with adults as well.
*  So no vaping, no e-cig, no smoking nicotine,
*  but a little pouch, which is different
*  than dipping tobacco or snuffing tobacco.
*  As far as I know, Zin pouches and things similar
*  deliver nicotine into the bloodstream,
*  which then crosses the blood-brain barrier,
*  goes into the brain, has this effect of creating focus
*  and alertness kind of a little high.
*  But doesn't carry the same carcinogenic risk,
*  but presumably there are other risks,
*  which include, of course, the addictive
*  and habit-forming nature of it,
*  the blood pressure increase, the vasoconstriction,
*  which is related to the blood pressure, et cetera.
*  But what do we know about Zin pouch use?
*  Is it on the rise, or is it that there's something
*  so compelling about vaping and e-cigs
*  that people in particular kids want
*  the physical act of vaping?
*  This is a case where, I've seen this one other time,
*  where actually the popular press is ahead
*  of the scientific press, and probably ahead of the science
*  in teaching us scientists that we better hurry up
*  and figure this out.
*  How is that?
*  So the popular press has been talking about Zin a lot
*  and arguing that it's a very popular product,
*  and that we're seeing, now this is true,
*  we're seeing a very sharp increase
*  in the market share of Zin compared
*  to other nicotine products, so we're seeing it on the rise.
*  What I mean by science hasn't caught up
*  is we don't have a lot of surveillance data
*  to show whether or not teens are actually using Zin.
*  We have some data, we actually published a study
*  a couple years ago showing around 20 to 25%
*  of people in general, adolescents and adults,
*  and about 11 to 15% of teens are using a pouch,
*  presumably Zin, we didn't ask, we now are looking
*  at our data around Zin use.
*  But we don't have wide-scale studies.
*  We do have studies of pouches more generally,
*  like the CDC showed that about,
*  I think it was a couple of percent, 1.5%,
*  and that it went up a little bit.
*  So I think, I can't remember, it was something like,
*  I think it went from 1.1% to about 1.5%
*  of teens seem to be admitting using pouches.
*  So not a huge increase, but a few hundred thousand teens
*  are using across the country,
*  as opposed to 2.5 million plus using e-cigarettes.
*  But with all those qualifications aside,
*  yes, we are seeing an increase in Zin use amongst teenagers.
*  What's most concerning is that it seems like it's teenagers
*  who are not using it in addition to e-cigarettes,
*  but new initiates.
*  So they're now, just like I'm concerned about,
*  teens initiating tobacco or nicotine through e-cigarettes,
*  now it seems like some are initiating through Zin.
*  So Zin is kind of the gateway.
*  It may be an on-ramp to using,
*  and the idea is that they're putting it
*  in between their lip and their gum,
*  and then each pouch of Zin is three or six milligrams.
*  It comes in a three milligram pouch or a six milligram pouch.
*  Now it is nicotine that, yes,
*  it's originally derived from tobacco,
*  but there's no tobacco in the pouch itself.
*  It's a white powdered nicotine.
*  And I don't know what else is in there.
*  We are really lacking the research there,
*  but my concern is we've seen this
*  with smokeless tobacco for years is oral cancer,
*  and you're putting this in the mouth and at the mucosal line,
*  and are we going to start being concerned about oral cancer,
*  which we've already been concerned about
*  with other pouches.
*  How would you get oral cancer if there's no tobacco
*  and it's just nicotine?
*  I was under the impression,
*  and please tell me if I'm wrong,
*  that nicotine itself doesn't cause cancer.
*  The question is what else is in there?
*  Is it just nicotine or is there aldehydes
*  and other chemicals that are cut with it?
*  So that's why I'm saying we don't know enough about it.
*  My big concern is exactly what you're saying.
*  Are we going to start seeing teens using nicotine
*  and then nicotine pouches and moving on?
*  But the brain piece, it doesn't matter.
*  What else is in there?
*  We are still concerned about the brain development,
*  and if you're using a three milligram
*  or a six milligram pouch,
*  and we know that a lot of teens
*  are using multiple pouches,
*  our study showed this as well,
*  multiple pouches throughout the day,
*  and actually some social media is showing teens
*  putting in several pouches at the same time,
*  then you might be getting, again,
*  as much as a pack of cigarettes of nicotine,
*  and that's very concerning.
*  So the whole piece we talked about before
*  about brain development and are we stunting or changing
*  or really rewiring the brain with nicotine?
*  Doesn't matter what form it's in, it is not good,
*  and it's not good for teenagers.
*  Yeah, I get asked a lot of questions about Zin pouches
*  and other nicotine pouches,
*  and one of the more common questions is related
*  to the fact that a lot of people start
*  with one or two pouches a day, quickly move to four to five,
*  and the typical ceiling for most people
*  that at least ask me questions about it
*  is moving to quickly a canister a day,
*  which is a lot of pouches.
*  I think it's 15 to 20 pouches per can.
*  Okay, so three to six milligrams.
*  Right, so do the math.
*  What's that, 60 to upwards of 60 milligrams?
*  That's three packs of cigarettes.
*  You got your step ahead of me, two steps ahead of me.
*  Yeah, let's play it safe, two, I'll give you,
*  at least two packs of cigarettes worth of nicotine.
*  And it's interesting in the old days
*  when we didn't have e-cigarettes
*  and we were talking about cigarettes
*  and we were talking about adults,
*  we would talk pack cigarette years, right?
*  How many packs of cigarettes and for how many years?
*  And that language kind of reduced for a while
*  because adults and people weren't using cigarettes as much.
*  And so we weren't worrying about this concept of packs.
*  I'm worried about it again.
*  We're getting so much nicotine now.
*  Now, yes, not in the form of combusted,
*  not in the form of burning,
*  maybe it's in the form of e-cigarettes or pouches,
*  but it's still a huge amount of nicotine
*  that we're seeing that young, very young brains are using.
*  Yeah, can't be good in my opinion.
*  I spent years studying brain development,
*  still teach brain development every year.
*  Can't be good.
*  The brain doesn't do well developing
*  with artificially high levels of any neuromodulator.
*  And then you go back to the eight-year-olds
*  we were talking about earlier.
*  And we have no studies, right,
*  on what does a drug like nicotine do
*  to not a teen brain, but a child brain.
*  And clearly is not good, but what exactly is happening?
*  We don't have those studies,
*  but it's incredibly scary to think about
*  what's happening with young people
*  and getting addicted so young
*  and then continuing that addiction
*  of a lifetime of addiction that they might have.
*  Seems like it would be appropriate now
*  to kind of take a step back.
*  I think everyone agrees that these are major problems
*  that are in our youth.
*  And just evaluate messaging and tools
*  to overcome these issues, right?
*  So obviously if you never try a substance or a behavior,
*  you can't get addicted to it.
*  But given the prevalence of this stuff,
*  what sorts of messaging work?
*  Earlier we talked about accessing the rebellious spirit
*  that is youth as a way to get youth
*  to engage in healthier behaviors
*  and abandon unhealthy behaviors.
*  But there's quitting, there's just saying no,
*  and then there's harm reduction.
*  There's convincing people that some substance
*  is bad for them and scaring them
*  to the point where they quit.
*  There's incentivizing them to be healthy.
*  There's replacement behaviors.
*  There's just so much in that landscape.
*  I know you just held a conference
*  on cannabis and tobacco recently.
*  I'm sorry I wasn't able to attend.
*  It sounds super interesting.
*  But whether or not we're talking about social media
*  or cannabis or risky driving behavior
*  or reckless behavior of any kind, what works?
*  And when I say this, I don't necessarily just mean
*  at the level of public health discourse,
*  but also parent to child, peer to peer, sibling to sibling.
*  What works?
*  I mean, how should one approach a kid
*  or an adult for that matter who's vaping cannabis
*  or is vaping nicotine
*  and it's just clearly going to be a bad trajectory?
*  What can one do?
*  I mean, we all also understand personal accountability
*  and neuroplasticity generally emerges best
*  when it comes from within as opposed from the outside.
*  But what can we do?
*  The most important is, and I've said this for years,
*  have a conversation.
*  And some people think that having a conversation about,
*  name your risk behavior, drugs of any sort,
*  alcohol, tobacco, other drugs,
*  having a conversation about sex,
*  having a conversation about risky driving,
*  get young people curious.
*  That is not at all the case.
*  There's nothing we can talk to a young person about
*  that they don't already know.
*  We're kidding ourselves to say,
*  oh, we can't mention drugs to a 16 year old
*  because we're going to get them curious.
*  They've known about drugs since they were eight years old.
*  We're not.
*  And I often say to parents, start that conversation young.
*  When your kids are really young, four or five,
*  maybe the conversation is having a cookie
*  or having some grapes and make,
*  or going to bed now or going to bed in five minutes.
*  I used to say that with my own kids,
*  you want to go to bed now or in five minutes?
*  So they felt like they were making the decision.
*  I didn't really care which decision they were making.
*  It was not a fight.
*  We need to start having conversations around decision making
*  and healthy decision making and not having a confrontation,
*  but a conversation very young.
*  Now I'm not saying that we talk about drugs or sex
*  when they're very young, although to be honest, I did.
*  I talked about cigarettes and pubertal development
*  with my kids when they were very young,
*  but just starting that conversation
*  so that when you move into more sensitive topics,
*  more difficult topics, as a child ages
*  and becomes an older child and into adolescence,
*  it's not shocking that you're having those conversations.
*  And this is whether you're a parent,
*  an educator or whatever.
*  So just talking, a conversation.
*  And not scheduling it, by the way.
*  Not on Saturday at three o'clock,
*  we're gonna sit down and talk about sex,
*  or three o'clock we're gonna talk about drugs.
*  That does not work.
*  I would joke that I was like
*  the queen of organic conversation.
*  I'd see something on TV.
*  Oh, let's have a conversation about that.
*  Just making it a natural part.
*  And you were asking about differences
*  in cultures and countries.
*  We don't normalize those conversations other countries do,
*  and we need to be doing that.
*  So that's one thing.
*  It sounds like we don't normalize them or formalize them.
*  Correct, we don't.
*  So that's one thing.
*  The other is we're kidding ourselves
*  if we just talk about the just say no,
*  as we were saying before.
*  Of course we want no use.
*  Of course we want teens to wait.
*  I mean, I often say we hope and expect that most people,
*  if not all, will grow up into a healthy sexual relationship,
*  whatever that might look like.
*  Even a healthy alcohol relationship,
*  a glass of wine or have a glass of wine at night with dinner.
*  Again, no safe use of a lot of the other drugs,
*  including nicotine, certainly fentanyl,
*  but illicit fentanyl.
*  Want to make clear, not all fentanyl, but illicit fentanyl.
*  But to just simply say no and don't do,
*  and it's bad for you,
*  is setting up again that failure of your conversation
*  because, okay, well, you're telling me it's bad,
*  but I liked it, or my friend liked it,
*  and it's not so bad, so you've lost credibility.
*  The most important part of harm reduction is not to do it.
*  Absolutely, of course.
*  Not to use, not to have risky sex,
*  maybe not to have sex at all until you're older.
*  Not to use tobacco, not to use any drugs.
*  But how do we do that with a young person
*  who you go into a classroom and 10%, 20%
*  have already started using,
*  or having sex or whatever the conversation is,
*  you shut them down.
*  Well, they don't understand me,
*  so why should I listen to them?
*  They're not talking to me.
*  And so that no-use conversation doesn't work.
*  There's a continuum or a spectrum of use.
*  Everything from no use to once in a while,
*  to regular use, all the way up to addicted use.
*  We're talking about drugs.
*  So to go in and assume that nobody's ever used
*  or nobody wants to use,
*  you're setting yourself up for failure.
*  That's the expectation, that's the hope.
*  But what we really also need to talk about is,
*  best if you don't use, but if you do,
*  if you are using, let's help you cut back or quit.
*  And if you are continuing to use, let's keep you safe.
*  Let's make sure that you're not gonna die.
*  And what I'm talking about here is,
*  when most parents, if their kids are gonna go to a party,
*  well, I shouldn't say most parents,
*  but a conversation often is,
*  hey, I hope you're not drinking, but if you are,
*  pick up the phone and I will come get you.
*  That's harm reduction.
*  And parents, oh, I didn't think about that.
*  Well, that's putting safety first.
*  That is a harm reduction message.
*  Or saying, you're pretty young to start having sex,
*  but here's a condom just in case.
*  Why do schools have condoms?
*  Because they know that as much as we say it's best to delay,
*  teens are going to.
*  That's harm reduction.
*  Let's at least reduce risk of STIs, pregnancy, and so on.
*  And what did the data say is the consequence
*  of harm reduction versus the kind of like thick black line
*  don't go anywhere near this behavior?
*  All the research or pretty much all the research
*  that I've read and hopefully will contribute to
*  shows that those messages, the harm reduction messages,
*  or what I would say comprehensive, really.
*  The harm reduction, unfortunately,
*  harm reduction has gotten a bad rap,
*  partly because of cigarettes versus e-cigarettes
*  and this harm continuum with tobacco.
*  So maybe we don't say harm reduction,
*  we say comprehensive conversations,
*  comprehensive education from no use all the way up to
*  what do we do if you are using.
*  And all the research is really saying that those messages
*  are way more effective than not using at all, than that.
*  If we tell teens don't use,
*  and we see this a lot in sexual behavior,
*  we say, do not have sex, period.
*  Sign a contract that you're not gonna have sex.
*  And then they're in a situation and we don't arm them
*  with the understanding of how to negotiate,
*  how to have a healthy relationship,
*  how to have a conversation.
*  What do they do if they're thinking that
*  they might want to have sex?
*  What do they do in that situation?
*  We then find that we're having teens who then
*  don't know how to protect themselves
*  and either have sex that was unwanted
*  or sex that was unprotected.
*  And teens want to understand, they want the truth,
*  they want the knowledge.
*  I went to a school and asked whether if I came
*  and talked about cannabis, would they come?
*  And they said, absolutely, I want to understand it.
*  And there's this great quote that I recently learned
*  that said, basically the concept is if you don't teach teens,
*  they're gonna seek out information.
*  So the quote is, having teens learn about sex from porn
*  is like having them learn physics from the Transformers
*  or having them learn how to drive from Fast and Furious.
*  We need to give teens the information
*  because they're gonna find it.
*  That's right, they're being exposed
*  to other information elsewhere anyway.
*  So what you're talking about here is coming up
*  with counterbalances.
*  Counterbalances, real science-based information
*  that's not overblowing the risks, that's not scaring them.
*  And then that helps them understand it's best to say no,
*  but if you do, fentanyl, let's make sure
*  you're not using alone.
*  Obviously, I don't want somebody using a drug
*  that hasn't been tested and they got off the internet period
*  because I know kids who have died.
*  It's so scary.
*  We have close friends that, gosh, I would have never guessed
*  that their kids were using drugs.
*  And maybe they were using drugs at the frequency
*  that was always typical of youth.
*  I don't know, I don't know the situations well enough,
*  but I would say about once every four, sadly,
*  once every four to eight months,
*  I hear about someone's kid or close relative
*  that died of a fentanyl overdose.
*  It does seem to be kids, maybe 30 and younger.
*  Yeah, it was more in the 20s and 30s.
*  It's now really getting into the teens and young adults.
*  You're absolutely right.
*  And some of the teens I know of and young adults
*  who have died were not your drug users.
*  We talked about not stigmatizing.
*  And that's the other thing.
*  If we don't talk, then we're stigmatizing.
*  We need to have those conversations.
*  But a lot of those teens were not using.
*  They needed a pill because they were in pain
*  or they needed something.
*  And they were not told, and this is, again,
*  that harm reduction and that conversation,
*  they were not told, don't buy something off the internet.
*  If you do, test it.
*  And test it with a fentanyl strip, for example,
*  and make sure that you're not using alone
*  because if you're using alone, we can't then give you Narcan.
*  We can't do something.
*  I carry Narcan with me all the time.
*  Do you really?
*  I do.
*  I have it in my backpack all the time.
*  For anyone that you might see that's having an overdose
*  or kids in particular?
*  Yeah.
*  Thankfully, it hasn't happened.
*  But if it does, I would.
*  And you can't hurt somebody from using it
*  if that's not what's happening.
*  So use it.
*  Should everyone carry a Narcan pen?
*  I think everybody should have Narcan.
*  I do.
*  I think every school should have Narcan.
*  I think every library should have Narcan.
*  I think every bar should have Narcan.
*  I absolutely believe it.
*  Now, test strips is an interesting debate
*  that I've had.
*  So I totally believe in this concept of comprehensive,
*  if you don't want to say harm reduction,
*  comprehensive drug education, comprehensive sex education.
*  And what I mean by that is both the spectrum of use
*  or behavior as well as all kinds of drug, sex, rock and roll,
*  that we talk about the whole thing.
*  But fentanyl test strips has been an interesting dilemma
*  within myself.
*  And I'll explain why.
*  I've been working with some groups
*  to try to test whether we could study whether if we put both
*  Narcan and fentanyl test strips in schools,
*  would teens get them?
*  So my fantasy, bowl of condoms, bowl of Narcan,
*  bowl of fentanyl test strips.
*  And you have it out for teens.
*  Wow, that's a bold statement.
*  It is a very bold statement.
*  What about the argument that I imagine
*  some people counter with?
*  I'm not necessarily saying this is my argument,
*  but just imagining that some people will hear that and say,
*  having those things visible, freely available,
*  will create more of an incentive for risk taking.
*  So I've grappled with that.
*  And with condoms, we know that that's not the case.
*  It's not going to create teens starting to have sex.
*  Just going back to what we said a few minutes ago,
*  you're not going to incentivize or create
*  people engaging in any risk behavior
*  by having the conversation.
*  But my grappling with the Narcan and with the fentanyl test strips
*  has been there.
*  Oh, well, you tell me it's a bad idea to use a drug,
*  but I'll just test it and make sure it's OK.
*  Well, I have a couple of problems with that,
*  even though I still believe in it.
*  I still believe in having those there, because right now,
*  we have an overdose epidemic with fentanyl and other drugs.
*  So I'll be honest with you.
*  I grapple.
*  If I were in a school and I saw a teenager taking a fentanyl test
*  strip, which probably means that they're going to use it
*  for themselves, is the first thing I want to do,
*  shake the kid and say, are you crazy?
*  Don't.
*  That means that you're thinking about using drugs.
*  Of course, that's my inclination as a parent, as a scientist,
*  as a developmental psychologist, as a human being.
*  You want to say, what are you doing?
*  So yes, I would grapple.
*  But at the same time, if I know that there's
*  a chance that a teen is going to go to a party or pick up a drug
*  and not know, would I rather that they're safe?
*  Yes.
*  The problem with fentanyl test strips,
*  though, is that they're not perfect.
*  If you are testing the right side of the pill,
*  but it's the left side that has fentanyl, you still could die.
*  And so I don't want to give the impression
*  that there's a one stop is going to fix anything right now.
*  It is not.
*  And that is the issue with the comprehensive drug
*  education or harm reduction conversations.
*  I'm not saying that it's perfect.
*  I'm not saying that it's going to stop young people
*  from engaging or young people from getting hurt or, you know,
*  unfortunately dying.
*  But if you have a group of youth who are going to use,
*  I would still rather arm them with that information
*  so they don't find themselves in trouble.
*  That is the biggest part that scares me.
*  Is fentanyl making its way into all pharmaceuticals,
*  like benzos, MDMA?
*  I'm thinking about some of the things that are taken
*  recreationally, benzos, MDMA.
*  Is it in cannabis?
*  So most of what I've seen is either by itself,
*  fentanyl using, or that it's mixed into pain pills a lot.
*  Why would kids want to take pain pills?
*  They're in pain.
*  They're stressed.
*  I see.
*  So they're doing it sort of self-directed, clinical.
*  Correct.
*  Or Prozac.
*  They're anxious.
*  I see.
*  So it's not like they're doing it for recreational drug use
*  at parties.
*  Some are.
*  Some aren't.
*  I mean, there's been so many different circumstances.
*  Cannabis and vaping have been interesting debates.
*  And we actually had this just the other day.
*  Some of the studies suggest that biologically, we
*  can't necessarily combine cannabis or nicotine
*  and fentanyl and have the same reaction on the body.
*  And some suggesting that the studies haven't been there.
*  And it's still so new.
*  But I will tell you that talking to teens and some studies
*  suggesting that, yes, teens are combining, or at least getting.
*  And a lot of times, it's not knowingly.
*  It's cut.
*  The fentanyl is cutting.
*  Or drug manufacturers and sellers
*  are cutting a drug with fentanyl.
*  And so they're not even teens are knowing it.
*  But that's some.
*  I was talking to a person the other day who
*  said that he has definitely heard of and seen some teens
*  with fentanyl overdoses from cannabis or from vaping.
*  So there's so much studies that are still needed right now.
*  I'm going to understand the biological mechanism,
*  as well as the access to these drugs that we don't know.
*  But I'm nervous.
*  So we teach about drug testing.
*  We teach about not getting something off.
*  There used to be a Skittle drug parties.
*  People would take drugs and all different things
*  and put them in the middle of a bowl in the middle of the room.
*  And just you take whatever.
*  Whoa.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  When was that?
*  This is not long ago.
*  Maybe 5, 10 years ago, I was hearing about these Skittle
*  parties.
*  Party like that?
*  I didn't either.
*  But I didn't go to any parties.
*  I was a pretty square kid.
*  It's interesting.
*  Maybe it was just, I mean, there were certainly drugs around.
*  But I feel like now recreational pharmacology, it
*  sounds like, is everywhere.
*  So different.
*  Yeah.
*  And self-medication is everywhere.
*  That wasn't common.
*  That wasn't as common.
*  Or if it was, people weren't talking about it.
*  I think it was.
*  I mean, I remember as a middle school student
*  walking into the bathroom and somebody had taken,
*  I think it was called a lewd then, and had passed out.
*  It was certainly around different drugs,
*  but not the same that we're seeing now.
*  And we definitely saw cocaine overdoses when I was younger.
*  Yeah, I feel like there was a lot of weed, cannabis, that
*  is, alcohol, psilocybin then as a recreational drug now.
*  Obviously, it's being explored as a clinical tool,
*  as is cannabis for that matter.
*  But hard drugs like cocaine, amphetamine, or PCP
*  were discussed in the media a lot.
*  And it certainly existed in some high schools and colleges
*  and things like that.
*  But it sounds like it's seeping out of everywhere.
*  It is.
*  And it's in these commercial products.
*  I mean, I think the picture that's been created here
*  is kind of an ominous one.
*  So how optimistic are you?
*  I will tell you I'm optimistic in seeing a change
*  in the landscape of education.
*  Now, some people say education doesn't work,
*  that we need policies.
*  We need both.
*  I mean, we have federal policies and regulations
*  that are slipping through the cracks.
*  FDA with regulation of e-cigarettes,
*  with cannabis legalization, but not being enforced.
*  We have age restrictions not being enforced.
*  So we certainly need education.
*  And I'm seeing more and more people, for example,
*  the concept of harm reduction or comprehensive education,
*  comprehensive sex ed.
*  Not everybody is, of course, up for it or open to it.
*  But I'm seeing more of a shift towards understanding the need.
*  I'm definitely seeing more teens,
*  as we were talking about earlier, more teens
*  being willing to say, no, that's not something I'm going to do.
*  More teens joining youth groups.
*  More teens speaking out about concerns
*  and trying to be healthier and make healthier decisions
*  for themselves.
*  So I'm optimistic in the human capital
*  and the social capital.
*  I'm not optimistic when it comes to the pharmacology
*  or the drug capital, so to speak.
*  More and more drugs infiltrating our youth.
*  I mean, you could vape dot, dot, dot anything nowadays.
*  And that makes me very nervous.
*  I do think vaping, and I am using vaping
*  instead of e-cigarettes there to be more lay conversations
*  there or what the culture is saying.
*  Vaping is just more normalized than we've ever had it,
*  just like smoking was normalized.
*  Vaping and now vaping anything is very scary to me
*  and very much normalized.
*  So that worries me.
*  Again, the fentanyl, the hallucinogens,
*  making its way more and more so that the drugs themselves
*  and the new devices scares me.
*  The social and the human capital gives me optimism.
*  Very grateful to hear that you have optimism.
*  Sounds to me, and correct me where I'm wrong, please,
*  and add anything that for parents, for siblings,
*  for teachers, for educators, or for any concerned citizen,
*  it seems like having conversations about these things,
*  the fact that they're happening,
*  so not turning a blind eye,
*  the fact that kids are aware of it,
*  that we're fooling ourselves if we think
*  that they aren't aware of these risk-taking behaviors.
*  They're all around them anyway,
*  so we shouldn't shy away from those conversations,
*  and that at least having a conversation
*  about the difference between avoiding behaviors
*  and harm reduction is something that one ought to consider.
*  I mean, obviously, this is a household-by-household choice.
*  Absolutely.
*  In some cases, school-by-school
*  or classroom-by-classroom choice,
*  but certainly household, maybe even parent-by-parent choice.
*  But because of social media
*  and just because of the nature of youth
*  that young people are having these conversations anyway.
*  That's what I'm hearing coming through,
*  and that you said don't formalize the conversation so much
*  that Saturday at three o'clock,
*  we're going to have a discussion about drugs,
*  but make it part of the landscape to create some ease.
*  Soly.
*  Make it facile to talk about these things, concerns,
*  and probably listen to them, too.
*  They're right there in the midst of it,
*  so they have a data set internally
*  about what's actually happening.
*  Totally agree.
*  Totally agree.
*  And I often say to parents or educators,
*  if they're listening to this podcast or anything,
*  it's actually say, hey, I learned something.
*  Can we have a conversation about what I learned?
*  And not confront.
*  Again, it's a conversation, not a confrontation.
*  It's let's normalize drug discussions.
*  Let's normalize behavior discussions,
*  not normalize the use or the behavior itself.
*  So talk to your teens.
*  You're absolutely right.
*  Talk to your teens.
*  This is what I just learned.
*  What do you know?
*  Can we find out some information together?
*  Go on our ReachLab websites.
*  Go on other websites.
*  Go learn information out there.
*  Learn together.
*  And not lecture, but have a conversation.
*  You may not know right away.
*  A teen may not tell you right away,
*  yes, I'm using, or yes, I'm having sex,
*  or yes, I'm drinking alcohol,
*  or yes, I'm doing something.
*  That is just a risky behavior.
*  But that's not necessarily our goal as adults
*  to find out today whether or not
*  somebody is doing something.
*  It's okay to let it be a little bit more organic.
*  It's okay to start that conversation
*  and see that you're building trust.
*  It is parent to parent.
*  But I would say, I'm not gonna bust you.
*  I certainly am not gonna be happy,
*  but let's have a conversation
*  so that way we can build the trust
*  and I could help you either not use, get help,
*  stop using, or be safer in using,
*  or help you prevent from using at all.
*  So having that conversation that organic
*  and talking to teens where they're at.
*  As a developmentalist, that's what we do.
*  Meet people where they're at.
*  Meet youth where they're at,
*  whether that's using already, not using.
*  Don't come at them with your preconceived notions
*  as an adult because it will not work.
*  It will backfire.
*  We need to use the strengths.
*  Young people are strong.
*  Young people are smart.
*  We need to use their strengths, take their lead,
*  and then use our adult wisdom and experiences
*  to then turn that into the proper conversation.
*  Love it.
*  Well, on the topic of conversation and communication,
*  one of the kind of unique features of this podcast
*  is that we have a large social media footprint.
*  And inside of that footprint,
*  we not only broadcast information,
*  but we get information back.
*  So in anticipation of this conversation today,
*  I reached out to followers of Huberman Labs social media
*  on X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram.
*  And they had a lot of questions for you.
*  We don't have time to go into the many thousands
*  of questions, but I'm going to just ask you, if I may,
*  in kind of a short Q&A format, a few of them.
*  And if you don't have answers, you can just say pass.
*  We'll get back to that.
*  We'll do another episode another time.
*  Please don't feel obligated to give thorough answers.
*  This is, we just wouldn't have time.
*  Yeah, so one of the top questions is,
*  would love to learn more about how to get teens
*  to see the longer term implications of the choices they make
*  and the habits they form now.
*  Is there any way to get them to understand
*  how now leads to later?
*  We've done studies where we've asked teens about their goals.
*  And I want to be a dancer.
*  We had one teen tell us, or I want to be a doctor,
*  or I want to be whatever it is.
*  Asking teens about their goals, about their aspirations,
*  and then connecting their current behavior
*  and their current risks and keeping themselves healthy
*  and how that plays into their goals.
*  That tends to work a lot, and we've seen that in our studies.
*  Teens set boundaries.
*  I don't want to get pregnant because I want to be a dancer.
*  Things like that.
*  So really linking what they're doing now
*  to their ultimate goals is one way
*  to really help them think that through.
*  I like that, how a different, maybe even larger goal
*  maybe could supersede these short-term behaviors.
*  They could see how those things link up.
*  Absolutely. That's great.
*  There's another question that came in,
*  requesting some positive news about teenagers to be shared.
*  Quote, every discussion is around risk or emotional distress
*  or social anxiety or phone addiction,
*  as if they're all dysfunctional because of their brains.
*  We never dismiss toddlers learning to talk and walk
*  because their brains are offline.
*  So I think the point is that,
*  can we highlight some of the ways in which the adolescent
*  slash teen brain is exceptional at something
*  that perhaps the rest of the brains out there are not?
*  So I mentioned some of them around our youth group
*  and about the youth movement now against drugs
*  and other things I think, and it comes to the optimism.
*  I'm the biggest teen advocate out there.
*  It's why I study adolescence
*  and I do the prevention and advocacy work that I do.
*  Teenagers are fundamentally fantastic.
*  They're creative. They're passionate.
*  Teens care about the environment.
*  Kids, teens really care about social justice.
*  Teens do care about our future and our planet.
*  That is wonderful, well more than do adults right now.
*  So I think we should be capitalizing on that.
*  Teens are incredibly creative.
*  We need to be working with teens and young adults
*  in everything that we do because they are our future,
*  and I don't mean that as a cliché. I really mean that.
*  So having the conversation,
*  let them be part of that conversation,
*  help them find out what they think we should do
*  to solve some of their problems.
*  They're the ones to talk to.
*  So I am very optimistic about teenagers.
*  We have 40 teenagers and young adults
*  who work with us all the time in our work
*  because we trust them.
*  So I think some people are afraid of teens.
*  I embrace them. I think they're fantastic.
*  Love it.
*  Do we know how vaping shapes the teen brain?
*  In other words, are there any known biological changes
*  in the developing brain as a consequence of vaping?
*  And here I'm going to assume it's vaping nicotine,
*  but we talked about cannabis as it relates to psychosis earlier,
*  so let's just keep it restricted to nicotine.
*  Sure, well we know that during the adolescence
*  that nicotine changes the brain wiring,
*  and what do I mean by that?
*  We're actually born with the nicotinic receptors.
*  We're born with the ability to become addicted to nicotine.
*  Same thing with the cannabis you were talking about before.
*  So if we don't, during the adolescent time
*  when we're pruning away and getting rid of the connections,
*  the neurons that we don't need,
*  what happens is during that process,
*  anything that we don't use, that we don't reinforce goes away.
*  Well, if we introduce nicotine into our brain,
*  it solidifies, it keeps that receptor there
*  and also makes it to where our receptor is really kind of,
*  I think of it as like keys and locks in a key,
*  and suddenly you've got that receptor and it says,
*  oh, you're putting nicotine in there, keep that in there, or cups.
*  It's developing those cups I often think about
*  and filling those cups with nicotine,
*  and those cups are your receptors that were already there.
*  You then take away that nicotine and your cups say, I need more.
*  So you're rewiring your brain,
*  you're wiring your brain to be more likely to become addicted,
*  and now you're addicted and you need to keep feeding those cups
*  with nicotine or you're going to go through withdrawal.
*  And so that is what is happening during an adolescent
*  and young adult that we don't see in adults.
*  That's why we really want to keep young people
*  away from nicotine as long as possible.
*  A lot of questions about,
*  are there negative effects of pornography
*  on the developing brain?
*  I imagine there's a lot of literature on that.
*  Yeah, I don't know as much actually in the developing brain,
*  I'm sure there is, I don't know it.
*  There is, but there's clear evidence about viewing pornography
*  around just not having good healthy sexual relationships
*  because porn is not normal.
*  It is not a normal relationship between two people.
*  What you are doing is really making it so that way you,
*  you're not necessarily developing a healthy relationship
*  with your partner because you're assuming
*  some gold standard out there
*  that may or may not be able to be achieved.
*  And it also is also a problem with body shaming
*  and the body types that most people don't have
*  and can't achieve.
*  And that's another problem out there with pornography.
*  A lot of questions about how social media
*  impacts brain development.
*  That's probably an entire episode unto itself.
*  It is, it is that we could do another time.
*  And we should, and if you'd be so gracious to come back
*  and do that, we will.
*  I think as just a final question,
*  is there any information about potential causality
*  between the mental health crisis that we observe in youth
*  and let's just say substance use
*  of the sorts that we talked about today?
*  Obviously the directionality is tricky there.
*  You can imagine that a lot of high-density cannabis use
*  is leading to more psychosis,
*  but it seems more likely that kids are self-medicating
*  in the face of like immense challenge,
*  not just the lockdowns and the culture around isolating kids
*  from other kids and the stress that was on everybody,
*  stress generally, the sociopolitical landscape, social media.
*  I mean, it's hard to not feel like it's at least a cloudier,
*  maybe a darker time than it used to be, but I don't know.
*  I mean, humans have evolved through a lot
*  and I don't know that it's also fair to say
*  that everyone's bummed out about what they see.
*  Presumably there's still some optimists out there.
*  So absolutely.
*  There are plenty of studies that show
*  the bi-directional relationship between anxiety, depression,
*  mental health and substance use.
*  You're right, a lot of teens are self-medicating
*  by using various substances to reduce their anxiety,
*  reduce their stress, and also just social lubrication, right,
*  of going into a party and pre-gaming
*  or going into a party and using drugs
*  to make themselves less stiff,
*  less stressed during that situation.
*  But more of what we're talking about
*  is that they're self-medicating
*  because they're feeling sad or uncomfortable
*  and they think helping them, again, it's not helping,
*  it's making them feel less bad by continuing to use.
*  But we also do know that drugs also lead to suicidal ideations,
*  suicide attempts, psychosis and other mental health issues.
*  We also know that drugs lead to reduced academic achievement.
*  Even though there's some potential cognitive reinforcement
*  that's going on, there's also some issues
*  with lack of concentration.
*  The other piece, by the way, that we don't really talk about
*  a lot, but it's the co-use, that we're seeing a lot of teens
*  not just using multiple products but using them together.
*  So a lot of teens who are chasing cannabis and tobacco
*  because it enhances the high
*  or they're using cannabis with alcohol
*  and other mixing of drugs, which is enhancing the high,
*  but not in a good way and very scary for young people.
*  And a lot of times young people don't even realize,
*  like with blunts, which is truly, as I was saying before,
*  using nicotine and cannabis together,
*  that you're actually becoming addicted to both products
*  really simultaneously.
*  And that we're seeing young people
*  who are having mental health issues and depression
*  were likely to use both products.
*  So definitely linkages there amongst mental health issues
*  and multiple products as well.
*  So polypharmacology.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, I don't want to end on a down note,
*  but I don't think it's a down note.
*  I think what you've done today in sharing with us
*  the realistic landscape of what's happening out there
*  and the realistic landscape of what you're trying to do
*  to ameliorate these issues is nothing short of spectacular.
*  Meaning as cloudy as it may seem in our youth,
*  there's also great hope in everything that you're conveying,
*  which is to put it simply,
*  why would you be trying so hard to fix these problems
*  if you didn't believe that they could be fixed?
*  So I find great optimism in the message.
*  I like data and you shared with us a tremendous amount of data
*  about what's happening, what likely needs to change,
*  and the optimal change and optimal route to change,
*  as well as some realistic, perhaps less than optimal,
*  but realistic approaches.
*  Sometimes it's just a matter of harm reduction.
*  We're not going to eliminate these potentially dangerous
*  behaviors or dangerous behaviors.
*  So for all of that, I want to say thank you.
*  It's a tremendous gift to us all.
*  And I know that we have a lot of parents and kids
*  and non-parents and every age and background
*  that listen to this podcast.
*  And what's clear to me is that it's going to be
*  a community effort to try and face all this.
*  And I keep hearing in the back of my mind,
*  this thing that you've said several times now,
*  that kids know what's happening.
*  We have to have these conversations.
*  They're hard conversations to have for any of us.
*  They're uncomfortable for adults to have.
*  But that until we normalize at least the conversation,
*  it's unlikely that we're going to solve these problems.
*  So thank you for your incredible efforts
*  in the research domain and also for helping to normalize
*  and bring about these conversations.
*  They're oh, so important.
*  Thank you so much.
*  Thank you very much.
