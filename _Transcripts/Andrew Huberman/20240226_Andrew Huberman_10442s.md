# Dr. Becky Kennedy: Protocols for Excellent Parenting & Improving Relationships of All Kinds
**Andrew Huberman:** [February 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT_6Lvkhxvo)
*  Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
*  where we discuss science
*  and science-based tools for everyday life.
*  I'm Andrew Huberman,
*  and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
*  at Stanford School of Medicine.
*  My guest today is Dr. Becky Kennedy.
*  Dr. Becky Kennedy is a clinical psychologist
*  specializing in parent-child relationships.
*  She received her degrees and did her training
*  at Duke University and Columbia University in New York.
*  She is the author of the bestselling book,
*  Good Inside,
*  a guide to becoming the parent you want to be.
*  She is also the founder and creator
*  of an online learning platform also called Good Inside,
*  at which parents and parents-to-be
*  can learn the best possible parenting skills
*  that are grounded in the fields of clinical psychology
*  that have been proven to work in the real world,
*  and that can allow people to navigate
*  common sticking points in parent-child relationships.
*  During today's discussion,
*  you will learn a tremendous amount of actionable knowledge
*  about what it is to be a good parent.
*  This is a conversation that pertains
*  not just to parents and parents-to-be,
*  but also uncles, aunts, grandparents,
*  and also those of you not planning to
*  or who do not want children.
*  I say that because while everything we discussed today
*  is grounded in the discussion
*  around parent-child relationships,
*  it indeed pertains to all of us
*  and relationships of all kinds,
*  including romantic relationships, friendships,
*  workplace relationships, and our relationship to self.
*  Dr. Kennedy defines for us and makes clear and actionable
*  what the exact job of good parenting is
*  and how that relates to other relationships
*  that we might have.
*  She explains how to set healthy boundaries
*  and in fact defines exactly what healthy boundaries are.
*  There's a lot of misconception about that.
*  We also talk a lot about empathy
*  and the need to make children and ourselves feel safe
*  in all kinds of relating.
*  We discuss how to navigate disagreements and arguments,
*  apologies and punishments, reward, and on and on,
*  all framed within a real world, real time context.
*  What I mean by that and what I think really sets apart
*  Dr. Becky Kennedy's work from so much else
*  that you'll see out there on parent-child
*  and other types of relationships
*  is that she makes what to do and say
*  and what not to do and say
*  in a variety of real world contexts very clear
*  such that you can access that knowledge
*  and do those specific things
*  and avoid those specific things even when things get tense.
*  In fact, especially when things get difficult or tense.
*  By the end of today's episode,
*  you will have learned a dozen or more very potent,
*  clinically backed tools to navigate parent-child relating,
*  including your relationship to your own parents,
*  alive or dead, and your relationship to self.
*  Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
*  is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
*  It is however, part of my desire and effort
*  to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
*  and science related tools to the general public.
*  In keeping with that theme,
*  I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
*  Our first sponsor is Matina.
*  Matina makes loose leaf and ready to drink yerba mate.
*  I often discuss yerba mate's benefits
*  such as regulating blood sugar,
*  its high antioxidant content,
*  the ways that it can improve digestion
*  and possible neuroprotective effects.
*  I also drink yerba mate because I love the taste.
*  While there are a lot of different choices
*  of yerba mate drinks out there,
*  I love Matina because again, they have the no sugar variety
*  as well as the fact that both their loose leaf
*  and their canned varieties are of the absolute best quality.
*  So much so that I decided to become a partial owner
*  in the company.
*  Although I must say,
*  even if they hadn't allowed me to do that,
*  I would be drinking Matina is the cleanest tasting
*  and best yerba mate you can find.
*  I love the taste of brewed loose leaf Matina yerba mate,
*  and I particularly love the taste of Matina's new
*  canned cold brew zero sugar yerba mate,
*  which I personally helped them develop.
*  If you'd like to try Matina,
*  go to drinkmatina.com slash Huberman.
*  Right now Matina is offering a free one pound bag
*  of loose leaf yerba mate tea and free shipping
*  with the purchase of two cases of their cold brew yerba mate.
*  Again, that's drinkmatina.com slash Huberman
*  to get the free bag of yerba mate loose leaf tea
*  and free shipping.
*  Today's episode is also brought to us by Juv.
*  Juv makes medical grade red light therapy devices.
*  Now, if there's one thing I've consistently emphasized
*  on this podcast,
*  it's the incredible role that light can have on our biology.
*  And of course, I'm always telling people
*  that they should get sunlight in their eyes
*  as soon as possible after waking on as many days
*  of their life as possible for sake of setting circadian
*  rhythm, daytime mood, focus and alertness and improve sleep.
*  Now, in addition to sunlight,
*  red light and near infrared light has been shown
*  to have positive effects on improving numerous aspects
*  of cellar and organ health, including faster muscle recovery,
*  improved skin health and wound healing,
*  even improvements in acne or that is removal of acne,
*  reducing pain and inflammation,
*  improving mitochondrial function
*  and even improving vision itself.
*  What sets Juv apart and why it's my preferred
*  red light therapy device is that it has clinically proven
*  wavelengths, meaning it uses specific wavelengths
*  of red light and near infrared light in combination
*  with the red light that trigger the optimal
*  cellar adaptations.
*  Personally, I use the handheld Juv every day.
*  The handheld Juv is about the size of a thick piece of toast.
*  And I also own a Juv panel that allows for full body
*  exposure and I use that one approximately five times
*  per week for about 10 to 15 minutes per session.
*  If you would like to try Juv,
*  you can go to Juv.com slash Huberman to receive $50 off
*  your first purchase.
*  Again, that's Juv, spell J-O-O-V-V.com slash Huberman
*  for your first purchase.
*  Today's episode is also brought to us by Aeropress.
*  Aeropress is similar to a French press for making coffee,
*  but is in fact a much better way to make coffee.
*  I first learned about Aeropress well over 10 years ago
*  and I've been using one ever since.
*  Aeropress was developed by Alan Adler,
*  who was an engineer at Stanford.
*  And I knew of Alan because he had also built
*  the so-called Aerobi Frisbee.
*  So he was sort of famous in our community
*  for developing these different feats of engineering
*  that turned into commercial products.
*  Now I love coffee.
*  I'm somebody that drinks coffee nearly every day,
*  usually about 90 to 120 minutes after I wake up
*  in the morning, although not always.
*  Sometimes if I'm going to exercise,
*  I'll drink coffee first thing in the morning,
*  but I love, love, love coffee.
*  And what I've personally found is that by using the Aeropress,
*  I can make the best possible tasting cup of coffee.
*  I don't know what exactly it is in the Aeropress
*  that allows the same beans to be prepared
*  into a cup of coffee that tastes that much better
*  as compared to any other form of brewing that coffee,
*  even the traditional French press.
*  The Aeropress is extremely easy to use
*  and it's extremely compact.
*  In fact, I take it with me whenever I travel
*  and I use it on the road in hotels, even on planes.
*  I'll just ask for some hot water
*  and I'll brew my coffee or tea right there on the plane.
*  With over 55,000 five-star reviews,
*  Aeropress is the best reviewed coffee press in the world.
*  If you would like to try Aeropress,
*  you can go to aeropress.com slash Huberman.
*  That's A-E-R-O-P-R-E-S-S dot com slash Huberman
*  to get 20% off any Aeropress coffee maker.
*  Aeropress ships in the USA, Canada,
*  and over 60 other countries in the world.

*  And now for my discussion with Dr. Becky Kennedy.
*  Dr. Becky Kennedy, welcome.
*  Thank you, so excited to be here.
*  I have a lot of questions for you.
*  And as I mentioned in my introduction,
*  much of what we are going to discuss today
*  relates to parent-child relating,
*  but pertains to relationships generally.
*  So people with children, without children,
*  who don't want children,
*  hopefully there aren't people that hate children,
*  but for all people out there with children or not,
*  planning them or not,
*  relationships are really just fundamental to who we are.
*  I actually place relationships,
*  including relationship to self,
*  in what we now think of as the six pillars of mental health,
*  physical health, and performance.
*  Sleep, nutrition, exercise,
*  relationships clearly vital to all aspects of life.
*  So I'd like to start off by just asking, for all of us,
*  are there some simple, or perhaps not so simple questions
*  that we can reflect on that give us a sense of
*  how good a parent we are or would be based on,
*  I don't know, our previous parent-child relationships,
*  our relationship to self.
*  What kind of things come to bear
*  when we think about really healthy relationships?
*  I can start rattling off a list of what I imagine
*  they could be, but what are your thoughts?
*  What's the parameter space, as we say?
*  How should we think about relationships,
*  besides just, oh, I either like this person
*  or don't, or I feel good around them or I don't,
*  or separating how I feel about them
*  versus how they make me feel?
*  Maybe we can drill a little deeper below
*  the kind of more superficial stuff
*  that we often see out there.
*  The first thing that comes to mind when you say that
*  is this word, sturdiness.
*  And to me, when someone says,
*  like, what is good inside is an approach,
*  and that's always the first word that comes to mind.
*  And I know that's like an odd word.
*  It's not a word we like use a lot,
*  although I do think most people, when you say,
*  that person's like a really sturdy person,
*  I think we all have some connotation
*  or feeling, at least, of what that means.
*  And I use it a lot, being a sturdy parent,
*  being a sturdy leader.
*  I talk a lot about the similarities to parenting
*  and kind of being a pilot of a plane.
*  And that word sturdiness comes up.
*  And so I remember a little while ago,
*  someone pushed me, they're like,
*  what's your definition of what that means?
*  And at that point, I thought, wow,
*  I should probably have a definition,
*  given I use it a lot.
*  But what I think it really means is an ability
*  to be connected to yourself
*  and to someone else at the same time.
*  And I think that is really the definition
*  of sturdy leadership, and that is the key thing
*  that's present in a healthy relationship,
*  that at once, I kind of know my values,
*  what I want, what I need.
*  I feel like I can be true to that.
*  And at the same time, I can kind of connect
*  to someone else who probably has different wants and needs
*  and maybe even slightly different values at the same time.
*  And the thing that leads me to next is,
*  what I think about as like family jobs
*  and a parent's job.
*  So in almost any other place, you could assume,
*  if I'm getting a new job at this company,
*  like there's just no way I could do my job well
*  if I don't know what my job is, right?
*  If you go to your desk and your boss is like,
*  have a good day, do a good job,
*  and there's no job description,
*  you'd be like, I think that's impossible.
*  But over and over with parents, if I say to them,
*  well, what is your job with your kid?
*  Or when your kid is having a tantrum,
*  or they hit, or they're rude,
*  or they lie to your face, or anything,
*  what is your job in that moment?
*  Most people, very well-intentioned, educated people
*  who would never ever take a job
*  if they didn't have a job description,
*  they look at me like, I have no idea.
*  So how can we do it well?
*  How can we then perform it to a place
*  to get to the outcomes we want
*  if you don't have the foundation of what your job is?
*  And to me, I thought a lot about it.
*  I think parents actually have two jobs
*  and it relates to sturdiness.
*  So you'll connect it.
*  Where one of our jobs is boundaries.
*  And to me, boundaries are things we tell people we will do
*  and they require the other person to do nothing.
*  And that's really important
*  because a lot of times we think we're setting a boundary
*  when actually we're making a request.
*  And boundaries keep us connected to ourselves.
*  They represent our values and our wants and our needs.
*  And in a parent-child relationship,
*  they also keep our kids safe.
*  If I just know in a simple way,
*  my kids watched enough TV today
*  and they really have to get to bed.
*  And I know that.
*  I don't want them to stay up late.
*  I kind of know what my family needs.
*  I have to set a boundary.
*  But the other part of my job is empathy and validation,
*  which is a way of connecting to someone else
*  where you see someone else's feelings
*  and experience as real.
*  You don't agree with it probably.
*  You don't necessarily condone the behavior
*  that's the representation of the feelings.
*  But the feelings themself you need to connect to.
*  And I feel like those are our two jobs as parents.
*  And that's really the way to be a sturdy leader
*  and to be in a sturdy, healthy relationship with your kids.
*  Wow.
*  So much there.
*  And I love it.
*  And here's one of the reasons I love it.
*  This notion of sturdiness,
*  something that I don't think we hear enough about.
*  You know, we hear about resilience, grit,
*  also important terms.
*  But sturdiness as you've described it
*  in the job of parenting really seems to include a lot
*  of verbs, not just nouns and adjectives.
*  And I'm a huge fan of verbs because biology
*  and to some extent psychology, yes, also psychology,
*  is all about verbs.
*  And so the labels often are mysterious,
*  but sturdiness, you know, just sends a clear message
*  of something that doesn't budge easily.
*  But then as you describe the job
*  of being a parent having boundaries,
*  and I'd like to drill into that a little bit more
*  how you view boundaries, but also empathy,
*  it's not a walled off picture.
*  It's one that is semi-permeable.
*  Also, and I confess I'm a bit obsessed
*  with old school psychoanalytic theory,
*  not as the be all end all of psychology,
*  but it also suggests like this other relationship.
*  Like I'm a person, I have a self,
*  you're a person, you have a self.
*  This is the opposite of codependency
*  where obviously dependency and two people being
*  quote unquote codependent can be healthy
*  in the context of relying on one another.
*  But as I understand it, when one person has a self
*  and another person doesn't have a self
*  or this notion of merging, not just in romantic relationships
*  but child parent relationships, you know,
*  I'm best friends with my mom or dad.
*  Is that a good thing?
*  I don't know.
*  But this notion of other other relationships.
*  It's like I'm a self, you're a self,
*  and we each see each other as another.
*  Anyway, I think there's so much to explore here.
*  So valuable.
*  You mentioned that boundaries are something that we do
*  and that requires that the other do nothing.
*  Can we go a little bit further into that?
*  Because it's a beautiful concept
*  and this notion of boundaries,
*  but like gaslighting narcissism
*  and all the other things that we hear about nowadays,
*  I think is often badly misunderstood.
*  So tell us more about boundaries
*  and how that looks in the action sense of it.
*  And this is all so connected to what you're saying,
*  that other other relationship.
*  I'm a person, you're a person.
*  And so many times that's actually is what gets merged.
*  And so my kid gets upset that I say
*  they can't watch another show.
*  And apparent really in that moment,
*  it's like their, whose feelings are whose?
*  They were upset, was I upset?
*  A second ago, I thought I should set the boundary.
*  And now all of a sudden I'm changing my mind.
*  There is this complete role kind of confusion and merger,
*  which is one of the main reasons
*  that kids get actually really scared
*  and escalate their behavior
*  because they don't have a sturdy leader
*  when they really need one.
*  So boundaries are what we tell someone we will do
*  and they require the other person to do nothing.
*  I like this definition for a lot of reasons.
*  I'm just very practical.
*  So it allows me after I set a boundary to assess,
*  was that a boundary or not?
*  Because let's take the TV example.
*  It's whatever time at night,
*  my kid has just watched a show
*  and they know they're supposed to watch one show
*  and then turn off the TV.
*  I hear from parents a lot, my kid doesn't listen
*  or my kid doesn't respect my boundaries.
*  And I'll say, okay, that sounds hard, let's get into that.
*  So then I'll say, so I told my kid to shut off the TV.
*  They just kept watching, they just kept on.
*  I told my kid to stop jumping on the couch
*  and they kept jumping.
*  They don't respect my boundaries, they don't listen.
*  To me, this is like a beautiful example of like,
*  this is a problem, I agree,
*  but this is not a boundary problem.
*  You made a request of your child.
*  And frankly, if you have your,
*  I'm making this up, seven-year-old watching TV,
*  I'm not so good at putting away TV and a phone at night.
*  It's just hard for me to do.
*  So your seven-year-old probably is just
*  addicted to what's ever happening.
*  And we're kind of asking our kid to do our job for us
*  because we don't want our kid to be mad at us
*  or whatever it is.
*  A boundary in that situation would be saying,
*  oh, you didn't put off the TV.
*  Look, by the time I get over there,
*  if you haven't turned off the TV,
*  and I don't wanna do this, but I will,
*  I will take the remote out of your hand and shut it off.
*  A boundary is saying, oh, after my request doesn't work,
*  can you get off the couch?
*  You can jump on the floor.
*  Look, if by the time I get over there,
*  you haven't gotten off the couch, I will pick you up.
*  That is, I'm not gonna put the success of my intervention
*  in my like seven-year-old's hand.
*  I care too much about my own needs and my own role
*  as a leader in my home to do that.
*  Same thing with, let's say, in-laws.
*  My mother-in-law doesn't respect my boundary,
*  she always shows up without calling.
*  Now, I don't wanna get to this point.
*  There's a lot of things in a relationship we can do
*  before we get to this point.
*  But if that's really a boundary,
*  and I have a very kind of intrusive mother-in-law,
*  a boundary would be saying, look,
*  this is gonna be awkward, and I know you mean well,
*  but the next time you come unannounced,
*  I will come to your car and say,
*  oh, this time doesn't work for us.
*  You cannot come in, and I will go back into my house
*  and close the door.
*  Now, there's gonna be lots of feelings around that,
*  but you are now setting a true boundary.
*  And when we say our kids don't listen,
*  those are often situations, not all of them,
*  but there's a big percentage
*  where I'm actually not setting a boundary early enough
*  and in a sturdy enough way,
*  which is what my kid needs,
*  because at that point, they simply don't have the skills
*  to inhibit an urge,
*  and they need me to be the boundary for them.
*  We hear sometimes that kids are craving rules.
*  They're craving boundaries.
*  I don't know, I was kind of a wild adolescent and teenager,
*  maybe a little more than wild.
*  I don't recall ever craving rules,
*  but I do recall paying attention to their lack of presence.
*  So what of that?
*  Is this notion that kids really want
*  and crave rules and boundaries,
*  is that sort of a, I don't know,
*  projection that we put onto them?
*  And I'm not exploring this just for fun.
*  I'm exploring it because I think that one thing
*  that's very helpful in setting boundaries,
*  especially with kids, is the idea that,
*  gosh, even if it's a bit painful,
*  to see them in discomfort,
*  there's that empathy piece that you talked about before,
*  that empathic attunement can get in the way of boundaries.
*  They're not mutually exclusive,
*  but these are somewhat competing forces at times.
*  So if we know or if we can acknowledge,
*  or at least explore this idea that rules are deep down
*  what they really want, not just what they need,
*  maybe it would help.
*  Yes, and I think, by the way, in my taking the remote away,
*  or taking my kid off the couch, just to be clear,
*  if I do that to my kid, they are not gonna say,
*  oh, mom, you are the best mom in the world, thank you.
*  They are gonna cry and scream.
*  And that's where boundaries and empathy,
*  those two parts of our job, actually do always go together.
*  I think they're actually partners.
*  They're not actually at odds,
*  because as soon as my kid is upset,
*  what I would say to them is,
*  oh, he wanted to jump on the couch.
*  It's not as much fun on the floor.
*  Oh, he really wanted to watch another show.
*  You didn't even want it this big.
*  You wanted to watch it this big.
*  It sounds crazy, because you're like,
*  why am I empathizing with that feeling?
*  They just kind of disobeyed.
*  No, they're two different things.
*  I'm doing my job and setting a boundary.
*  They're actually doing their job
*  and feeling their feelings.
*  That's actually their job.
*  The only way you can ever learn to regulate a feeling
*  is through feeling the feeling.
*  So they're doing their job.
*  Now I'm gonna validate,
*  and this is how kids learn emotion regulation.
*  Boundaries, they feel, I validate, I hold the boundary,
*  over and over and over.
*  So do kids crave rules?
*  And I think one of the issues
*  is that most parenting approaches have one or the other,
*  and I think they're both very incomplete strategies.
*  If you just lead with rules, right,
*  I don't know who said it, definitely wasn't me,
*  like what is it, rules without relationship lead to rebellion?
*  Yeah, that's what happens, right?
*  So that's not good.
*  But I see the stainage we've swung the other direction.
*  It is also not a complete parenting strategy
*  when your kid's jumping on the couch to do nothing
*  if you think that's dangerous and just saying,
*  oh, you really wanna jump, jump, jump,
*  and such big feelings.
*  Like that's not what kids need.
*  I think kids crave boundaries
*  and they crave feeling seen and understood.
*  Because as kids are growing up,
*  like I think the questions they're always asking parents,
*  even though of course they never say this,
*  is just, am I real and am I safe?
*  Every interaction, that's what they're asking us.
*  The reason we have to validate their feelings
*  when they're upset, even though they're so upset
*  just that their string cheese broke, whatever it is,
*  is feelings don't have markers,
*  like blood, or they don't know.
*  And so when we say, oh, you wanted your string cheese
*  to be together, what we're really saying
*  is the things you experience inside of you are real.
*  But kids are also desperate to know,
*  how far do things go?
*  No one likes to feel boundary-less as a kid.
*  That's terrifying, right?
*  And so when we set a boundary, we actually say to a kid,
*  I will always protect you.
*  I won't let things get so far out of control.
*  I don't know if it's rules, but kids crave connection.
*  And I think boundaries and validation and empathy,
*  they are the two forms of connection
*  that kids are really desperate for.
*  What about rewarding kids?
*  And here, rather than start off by asking,
*  what are the best ways to reward kids in healthy ways?
*  I will ask that in a moment.
*  How can we evaluate the notion of rewards or incentives
*  through this lens of sturdiness, boundaries, and empathy?
*  Because I could imagine a reward that's outsized
*  in comparison to what a kid did.
*  Okay, great, you took your plate
*  to the kitchen sink after dinner.
*  You get $10,000, obviously, out of scale,
*  an extreme example, but just by way of example,
*  screw up their reward mechanisms for life,
*  if you ask me, everything I know about reward
*  and neuroplasticity says that that would occur.
*  But this idea that you can incentivize kids,
*  if you turn off the TV now,
*  then you definitely can watch tomorrow night.
*  Whereas if you don't, you can't.
*  So you're sort of merging reward and potential punishment.
*  How do we bound rewards?
*  And how do we take into account
*  that when we start adding rewards to scenarios
*  that we're mixing and matching life experience for them?
*  Okay, so now doing what I'm told,
*  do I always expect a reward?
*  If the reward doesn't come next time,
*  we know based on reward prediction error,
*  we tend to be worse off emotionally
*  than had we never received a reward in the first place.
*  Again, pretty vast parameter space,
*  but what are your thoughts on best ways to reward kids
*  for standard good behavior versus achievement,
*  versus elimination of bad behavior?
*  Yeah.
*  So three categories.
*  I think you're asking a much bigger question,
*  or I think you are, which is like,
*  why do parents think we need to reward kids?
*  I think that's, why do we think we need to punish kids?
*  And this is actually where everything I work on
*  started from, because the way I was trained
*  to work with parents, I went to the best gold standard
*  evidence-based program, and it was all about timeouts
*  and punishments and rewards and stickers
*  and ignoring and praise.
*  And honestly, during the training for the years
*  after I kind of practiced this way,
*  I feel like that, you know this better than I am,
*  so I shouldn't even say this,
*  but that left part of my brain,
*  logic and linearity, I was just like, this is amazing.
*  Oh my goodness, we're gonna get more of the good behavior
*  and we're gonna not get the bad behavior
*  and I'd start teaching this to parents in my private practice
*  and there was this little thing in me,
*  I don't even know, I was like, I don't know about this.
*  I don't know, and it get louder and louder
*  to the point that in a session, I literally said to
*  a parent in front of me, I was just like,
*  telling them how to do a timeout and I said,
*  I'm sorry, I don't believe anything I've been telling you.
*  That's literally what I said, because I just,
*  it was so loud and it was obviously super awkward,
*  but it led me to, I feel like from this first principles way,
*  be like, there are a million assumptions that we have
*  about raising kids and I think about relationships
*  and if I just strip them back, what would I be left with
*  and what would be a new building from there
*  and rewards and punishments to me are these assumptions
*  that we have somehow converted from the fiction shelf
*  of the library in my mind to the non-fiction shelf
*  as like truths and I kind of rail against all of them.
*  So I think the question, if that's okay to go
*  in that direction to me is like, why do we think
*  we need to reward kids and is there actually
*  a better system, both short term and long term?
*  I'm incredibly long term greedy in my parenting approach
*  because at the end of the day, 18 and up is where
*  things really matter, not really matter,
*  I mean they all matter, but I'd rather,
*  I wanna help my kids become sturdy, resilient adults,
*  but I'm short term greedy too because I'm a realist,
*  like I just can't deal with all these difficult moments.
*  You get both for sure without rewards and punishments.
*  So I don't know, what might someone tell me
*  they give a reward for?
*  Do you wanna use the like clearing the table or example?
*  Let's start that there.
*  It kind of goes back to like believing kids
*  are inherently good inside, I really think it goes back
*  to that, if you really believe kids are inherently good
*  inside, which by the way, when I strip back every assumption,
*  the only thing I was left with that literally,
*  the only thing and then I started to think, okay,
*  so if they're good inside, why do they do so many
*  annoying things like all the time?
*  But that gave me a gap and I feel like that is very exciting
*  to have a gap, like why do people who are good inside
*  do such bad things, right, adults or kids?
*  And to me, right, kids are born with all the feelings
*  and none of the skills to manage those feelings,
*  like period, and we've often thought therefore
*  when feelings, feelings without skills come out
*  in behaviors, I think that's what bad behaviors are,
*  feelings or urges or something without a skill
*  to manage them or without access to the skill,
*  maybe in that moment, either way.
*  And then we end up punishing behavior,
*  but the behavior was just a sign of the lack of skill.
*  So I can't imagine anyone thinking I could teach my kid
*  to swim by punishing them for not swimming,
*  like I think someone would say that was crazy.
*  But that's kind of how we raise kids.
*  And then we think rewarding them is gonna be effective,
*  but it actually leads over and over to what you said.
*  I've seen these parents over and over in my private practice,
*  my 14 year old literally won't pick up their clothes
*  from the floor unless I give them $5, like how did I get here?
*  And I'm like, yeah, that's a problem,
*  but I saw how they got there.
*  So let's take clearing their plate.
*  I know this is gonna sound cheesy,
*  but kids do have something in them where they wanna feel
*  like a purposeful, meaningful part of society, they do.
*  Impact drives adults and it drives kids.
*  It's not the same type of rewarding as playing Fortnite,
*  it's a totally different system.
*  But I think the question is like,
*  why do we think we have to bribe kids or trick them
*  into doing things that are basic parts of human life?
*  And so if we take that and my kid chronically
*  isn't clearing their plate, I could say to them,
*  look, every time you clear a plate,
*  I'm gonna give you a sticker.
*  After five stickers, you're gonna get,
*  I don't know, whatever it is.
*  To me, like a much more just effective way
*  is I'd say to my kid, hey, I know you know,
*  like clearing a plate is just one way
*  of being part of this family and taking care of stuff.
*  I know you know that, we're on the same team.
*  I say that for you, we're on the same team, right, we are.
*  Something's getting in your way of remembering.
*  I'm gonna assume I like the most generous interpretation.
*  That to me allows you to separate someone's bad behavior
*  from their good identity.
*  Then I'm gonna say, what would help you remember?
*  We literally did this with my son
*  who always had his towel on the floor.
*  I was just like, I bet he just doesn't remember.
*  He literally doesn't see it.
*  We talked about it and he's like,
*  we talked about him putting a post-it, literally,
*  something simple, like a post-it on my door
*  that just says, pick up my towel.
*  He wrote it in his own handwriting, right,
*  trying to facilitate him like solving his own problems.
*  Now he has a much higher rate of picking up his towel.
*  I guess I could have said, every time you pick up your towel,
*  you'll, I don't know, get a dollar or whatever it is.
*  But again, it makes me think,
*  I'm not building the generalizable skill that way.
*  I'm just kind of offering something at the end,
*  which sets me on this kind of awful cycle
*  that I think kind of misses the point.
*  I'd like to take a brief moment
*  and thank one of our sponsors, and that's AG1.
*  AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
*  that also contains adaptogens.
*  I started taking AG1 way back in 2012.
*  The reason I started taking it
*  and the reason I still take it every day
*  is that it ensures that I meet all of my quotas
*  for vitamins and minerals.
*  And it ensures that I get enough prebiotic and probiotic
*  to support gut health.
*  Now, gut health is something that over the last 10 years,
*  we realized is not just important for the health of our gut,
*  but also for our immune system
*  and for the production of neurotransmitters
*  and neuromodulators, things like dopamine and serotonin.
*  In other words, gut health is critical
*  for proper brain functioning.
*  Now, of course I strive to consume healthy whole foods
*  for the majority of my nutritional intake every single day,
*  but there are a number of things in AG1,
*  including specific micronutrients
*  that are hard to get from whole foods
*  or at least in sufficient quantities.
*  So AG1 allows me to get the vitamins and minerals
*  that I need, probiotics, prebiotics, the adaptogens,
*  and critical micronutrients.
*  So anytime somebody asks me
*  if they were to take just one supplement,
*  what that supplement should be, I tell them AG1,
*  because AG1 supports so many different systems
*  within the body that are involved in mental health,
*  physical health, and performance.
*  To try AG1, go to drinkag1.com slash Huberman,
*  and you'll get a year's supply of vitamin D3K2
*  and five free travel packs of AG1.
*  Again, that's drinkag1.com slash Huberman.
*  I love the idea that kids want purpose.
*  And am I correct in wondering if that goes back
*  to this am I real component of the am I real, am I safe?
*  Yes.
*  Like one way that we know we are real
*  is our ability to impart change on the world around us.
*  I don't want to get too abstract here,
*  but you know, as a neuroscientist,
*  I've often sat back and reflected
*  like all the emotions we feel,
*  like no one sees that or knows that.
*  Unless we say something, we write something,
*  we sing something, we shout something,
*  you know, all the forms of expression,
*  just like none of our dreams, our creative insights
*  or wishes exist except inside us,
*  unless we transmute them into something in the real world.
*  So there does seem to be something
*  about having this nervous system
*  from a time we're really young,
*  like it's seeing our effect on the world
*  that really makes us real and on others.
*  And I love the idea that, well, and I must say,
*  I absolutely believe in my heart
*  and I just feel it as a feeling
*  that kids are inherently good inside.
*  Like I just, I can't imagine any other version of that,
*  but does that mean that there are people out there
*  who believe that kids are inherently bad
*  or at least not good?
*  I mean, like how could that be?
*  But then again, maybe I'm just naive.
*  I don't know if anyone consciously believes that,
*  but when I go back to that system
*  I was first trained in, rewards and punishments,
*  like it feels like a system of behavioral control.
*  And to me, like I've always thought about control
*  and trust as opposites.
*  So I only control what I don't trust.
*  So nobody said to me in that program,
*  by the way, Becky, everything you're learning here,
*  we believe kids are bad inside and so we do this thing.
*  But well, if I don't trust my kid,
*  and if I don't trust they inherently have the things
*  in them to do good, by the way,
*  that's not gonna happen naturally.
*  That's why we have a big job as a parent
*  to coach our kids, to bring that out,
*  to set boundaries when they can't do it
*  and so many other things.
*  But I don't believe anyone would say,
*  yeah, it's cause they're bad inside,
*  but there is a nature where you're constantly interacting
*  with your kid from that other system,
*  looking at them like, I don't trust you.
*  I don't trust you.
*  And when you do bad things,
*  I cannot hold on to the fact that you have a good identity.
*  That's why I'm giving you a punishment.
*  That's why I'm sending you away to your room.
*  And so if I'm reflecting back to you constantly
*  that you are just your latest behavior,
*  that I don't trust you, that I kind of have to bribe you
*  to do very basic human things,
*  well, our kids form their identity
*  from our reflection of them.
*  And so then this is what really compelled all of this.
*  I'm like, we're raising generation after generation of kid
*  kind of saying to them,
*  you're kind of a bad, untrustworthy kid.
*  And then we wonder why we have such high rates
*  of like massive mental health problems.
*  Well, there's some linearity there.
*  I'm curious about this notion of impingement.
*  I've heard about this idea that when we're young,
*  we're forging life, deciding,
*  do I like the way this tastes or not tastes?
*  By the way, I still hate anchovies.
*  I don't need to be asked again to know the answer.
*  But when you're young, we're encouraged to do things
*  like eat your broccoli, taste the anchovy.
*  And some parents, it seems, are very comfortable
*  with the idea of allowing their children
*  to have their feelings and their wishes.
*  As I always say, the nervous system seems to be divided
*  into yum yucks and meh, mehs.
*  I guess the plural will be mehs.
*  Yum yucks and mehs.
*  I mean, it's more complicated than that.
*  But like with people where you're like,
*  yeah, I really like them,
*  or no, something's off there, like meh, you know.
*  So it's not that much more nuanced than that.
*  And the brain's got to make decisions after all.
*  Excuse me.
*  So, you know, kids have their yums, yucks, and mehs.
*  And then we've got our ideas about what they need to do
*  in order to progress through life,
*  often inherited from our parents
*  and hopefully modified by the wonderful work
*  that you're doing and writing about and in your program.
*  Then we're talking about here.
*  But, you know, how much space should we allow
*  for kids to be unimpinged?
*  Like, you don't want to eat what we're eating for dinner?
*  You're like, okay, I'm not going to cook you
*  an entire new dinner, but then I guess like,
*  you might go to bed hungry.
*  Sounds harsh, right?
*  But the other version is, okay,
*  what would you like for dinner?
*  Well, I prefer, let's say they pick a healthy option.
*  They prefer pasta, not chicken.
*  Okay, we won't do the ice cream chicken, you know, thing.
*  Do we do it?
*  Right, like how much impingement?
*  I don't want to watch a movie with the family.
*  I want to play in my room.
*  At some level, you know, I've heard it both ways
*  that impingement is needed for safety and life progression.
*  But there's times when it's more subtle than that.
*  It's not about safety and life progression.
*  It's not about going to school
*  or not going to school, homework or no homework.
*  It's about like, do you want to come with us to the park?
*  You want to play at home in your room?
*  How often should we impinge?
*  How do we know?
*  This is kind of the tricky areas of parenting
*  that I think because it doesn't fall into the extremes.
*  Yeah, I love this question.
*  That's a word I don't often hear actually.
*  Impingement, like, can you act like what?
*  Like impinging on the child's inherent natural desires
*  or aversion to things.
*  Got it, okay.
*  Like you say, hey, we're going over so-and-so's house
*  and they say, you know, I don't like their kids.
*  You go, well, listen, you got to learn to play
*  with other kids and go, no, I don't like their kids.
*  And you say, did something happen?
*  And so we're not talking about a dangerous situation.
*  No, I don't like them.
*  I just really want to just stay home.
*  This is a great-
*  So are we going to impinge on their,
*  I mean, because we're teaching them,
*  either way we're teaching them something.
*  You got to do stuff you don't want to do,
*  even if you don't like it.
*  And we're here again, we're ruling out the possibility
*  that there's something unsafe about the environment,
*  psychologically or physically unsafe.
*  But at the same time, we're teaching them,
*  hey, I see you, I hear you,
*  but you know, your desires might not be right.
*  There's actually a kind of like a tacit message
*  of the way you feel might not be the best gauge
*  of what's best for you,
*  which sends a complicated message to a kid.
*  Totally.
*  So this is again, where I think at Good Inside,
*  like family jobs are so useful.
*  Family jobs to me, when I used to meet with parents
*  and like they describe a situation,
*  I feel like 90% of the time that's where I'd start
*  because then that flows from there.
*  It's like a framework.
*  So what is my job?
*  I'm the one who sets boundaries.
*  Like I am the one who makes key family decisions.
*  Obviously as our kids get older,
*  they should be making some decisions too.
*  No one likes to feel controlled, but key decisions.
*  And my job is to validate my kids' experience.
*  This is actually complicated because again,
*  over and over we think that validating my kids' experience
*  means they're gonna dictate a decision.
*  My boundaries don't dictate my kids' feelings
*  and my kids' feelings should not dictate my boundaries.
*  They're just two equal things.
*  So this is a great example.
*  My kids are like, you know,
*  I don't like playing with those kids
*  and can I just stay home with,
*  let's just say grandma was home.
*  Can I just stay home?
*  And I'm like, I just think it's important to go as a family
*  but my kid doesn't wanna go.
*  There's nothing dangerous.
*  Okay, to me this is that exact way
*  of putting family jobs into action.
*  Sweetie, like and to me this phrase,
*  I wish every parent could say this to their kid.
*  I believe you.
*  If you wanna make a kid feel real and confident for life,
*  confidence comes from the experience of being believed
*  because that's how you, for me confidence is self-trust.
*  It's not feeling good about yourself.
*  It's self-trust.
*  I really do know the way I feel.
*  So let's say I say to my son in that situation,
*  it's I believe you.
*  I'd start to, I believe you.
*  Look, I know you wanna play football all day
*  and the kid around your age hates football like that.
*  We're probably lowest on your list of types of kids
*  you'd wanna hang out with for the afternoon.
*  I totally believe you.
*  And in this family, we know that sometimes we have
*  to do things we don't love to do.
*  We do that for a family experience.
*  I say this to my kid all the time.
*  You know, also just to end up being a good adult,
*  you just have to end up practicing as a kid,
*  doing things you don't wanna do,
*  things that are boring, things that aren't your preference.
*  So you know, you notch in your belt for that.
*  So you don't have to thank me.
*  And also I know you have it in you to do your best,
*  to be polite and engaged.
*  Like I just, I know you're a good kid
*  and this isn't what you want
*  and I know we're gonna get through it.
*  Now, if it's really hard, maybe young,
*  hey, let's create a sign.
*  Like, can you look at me and go,
*  when you feel like you're kind of at this
*  and then me and you are gonna go to the bathroom,
*  I'm gonna give you a hug and right,
*  I'm gonna say, I know this isn't what you want
*  and when we get home, we can watch that football game,
*  whatever it was, right?
*  Because what we often do is we leave ourselves
*  with two choices with kids.
*  We either say, fine, stay home.
*  Their feelings actually just dictated the decision.
*  That's not helpful for them.
*  I don't want my kid to learn in life.
*  When I don't wanna do something,
*  people twist and turn to make that thing not happen.
*  Like that's disturbing for adulthood expectations.
*  But then we do the other thing,
*  which is like, you are so selfish.
*  Just because you don't have a friend,
*  your age doesn't mean that you can't come with us.
*  So we either let their feelings dictate
*  or we think our boundaries kind of give us the right
*  to be mad at our kid, right?
*  Like to do both is so important.
*  And so that's where I think to me,
*  when I hear impingement, like I actually think
*  that is the exact space where you have the most bang
*  for your buck as a parent.
*  Like it's not enjoyable.
*  And again, if I have my beautiful intervention with my son,
*  do not think my kid will look at me and say,
*  I love how you explained that.
*  That was so beautiful.
*  No, he's gonna roll his eyes.
*  My job is not to take the bait,
*  cause I'm an adult and to also hold hope.
*  I think that's really important.
*  This concept of I'm validating my kid's feelings
*  where they are today,
*  but I need to be the one to hold hope
*  that they can cope with it.
*  If I can't name to my kid,
*  I know you're gonna get through it.
*  They're not gonna be able to see that kind of next,
*  more mature version of themselves.
*  And I actually think it's the same as your best boss.
*  You know, it was like,
*  I know you don't wanna go on this trip.
*  I don't, whatever it is,
*  I know this presentation topic
*  isn't the one you would have chosen.
*  And there were 10 things and this was literally number 10.
*  I totally get that and it stinks
*  and I'm not taking anything away from that.
*  And this is the thing I need you to do.
*  And I know something about you.
*  Like when you put your mind to something,
*  you always do a great job.
*  And like, it's probably not gonna be enjoyable,
*  but I do know you're gonna do a great job on this.
*  Like, that's like the boss you want.
*  Amazing.
*  Are you adopting children by the way?
*  Cause I'm, I actually finished college.
*  I actually arrived with-
*  You I consider Andrew, you adult children.
*  What I'm hearing is don't dictate their behavior with,
*  and I'm gonna underline in bold dictate,
*  don't dictate their behavior.
*  You're going to do this because I said so.
*  That's dictatorship.
*  But at the same time,
*  don't quash the emotion behind the resistance.
*  Kind of acknowledge it, make them feel real.
*  I believe you.
*  I love this phrase.
*  Amazing.
*  And I love your definition of confidence.
*  If people didn't hear that,
*  we're definitely gonna repeat it again.
*  And we're gonna etch it into your neural circuitry
*  cause I love that.
*  It's a self-trust.
*  Yes.
*  And this notion of giving hope,
*  you're giving them an incentive
*  that's based on a reward that's actually good for them,
*  that they can translate to other situations as well.
*  Wow.
*  Can I double click on reward?
*  Because you know what it made me think?
*  I didn't think until you said that.
*  Like, I think in a situation where you'd be tempted to say,
*  like, and if you go and you're polite,
*  I'll give you 20 extra minutes of Roblox, right?
*  That's like, and first of all,
*  let me just say something like,
*  whatever I say to you, like for listeners,
*  like, it's not like I do this stuff all the time
*  with my actual kids.
*  I'm the first one sometimes to be like,
*  here's your thing I have to dangle.
*  We'll provide a little section in the comment section
*  on YouTube where your kids can,
*  no, I'm just kidding.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  Your kids are forbidden.
*  No, wait, that's, wait, that's dictating.
*  We understand why you,
*  I believe that you would want to comment,
*  but we're gonna trust,
*  we're gonna let you know why it's good for you if you don't.
*  Anyway, I'll practice this on someone else's kids.
*  But the reward, like,
*  the reward, when your kid ends up seeing themselves
*  capable of doing something
*  they didn't previously think they could do,
*  you know better than me, like,
*  I feel like that is like one of the best rewards,
*  even if it's getting through a social situation,
*  or I think about this a lot with, you know,
*  my little kid is, I don't know,
*  like struggling with a puzzle or something,
*  and I could just do it for them,
*  or if I help them kind of regulate,
*  oh, this is a hard puzzle, and you can take a break.
*  I just know you're gonna figure it out today.
*  I just know it.
*  And then because of that, they get there.
*  That feels in your body,
*  like that is the best kind of reward.
*  And it's the type of reward
*  that works for kids in adulthood.
*  When they're in a job,
*  we want them to be motivated
*  by the feeling they're gonna have of pride,
*  not be saying, hey, I finished my thing early.
*  Do I get a bonus to their boss?
*  Like, that's not gonna play out as well.
*  I love it.
*  I'm just pausing and shaking my head
*  only because I love it so much.
*  And I just wanna make sure
*  that I don't quickly move to the next question
*  without drilling down even deeper
*  into some of these concepts.
*  I believe you as the feedback or response
*  that can instill real confidence over time.
*  Not to get too nuanced here,
*  but how is it different?
*  Because I sense it is different than I hear you.
*  But you're gonna do this anyway.
*  Or I hear you, but listen, in this family,
*  I believe you, the word believe is powerful.
*  And I believe there's real power in specific words,
*  as is, for instance, sturdiness.
*  Again, that's such a powerful and underused word.
*  I believe you.
*  You're a psychologist.
*  What do you think we're hearing
*  when somebody says, I believe you,
*  that's different than I hear you?
*  I haven't listed these out,
*  but I think we all have these core needs as humans.
*  And I think being believed is one of them
*  because it's someone else kind of saying, you're real.
*  That's what, I might not feel what you're feeling,
*  but that thing that feels strong to you
*  that nobody can see or measure is real.
*  And when I think about the most confident people,
*  I think about this girl who I went to Duke with,
*  and she was just brilliant, so smart.
*  And we were in this seminar.
*  It was one of these small classes
*  where this professor was talking about stuff.
*  And I, for once, I was like,
*  I have no idea what this person's talking about.
*  But I was like, no one else was stopping.
*  And this girl raised her hand,
*  and she said, I'm sorry if everyone else is annoying.
*  I have no idea what you're talking about.
*  Is there any, because I usually do,
*  and is there any way you could say that in a different way?
*  That is to me the utmost version of confidence,
*  that she believed her own experience of confusion
*  was real confusion.
*  She didn't think it was a sign she was stupid.
*  She believed it.
*  She believed herself.
*  That is so confident.
*  And I think when someone says, I hear you,
*  it's like a version of listening.
*  There's many worse phrases.
*  No damage is done.
*  When we follow anything but, but, we tend to invalidate.
*  So that's not good anyway.
*  I believe you, but is also not gonna.
*  But there's a million examples of this to me
*  that build confidence.
*  And I actually think there's so many situations with kids
*  where they say situations and we worry,
*  oh, they have low confidence.
*  And then we intervene to quote, make them feel better,
*  which actually is the thing that lowers their confidence.
*  Cause it's like, we say to them, I don't believe you.
*  You're not really feeling the way you feel.
*  Where I believe you is the exact opposite.
*  So like, I like to give examples
*  just cause it makes it concrete.
*  Like my kid will come home and say,
*  I don't know.
*  I was picked last for dodgeball today.
*  I was picked last in something.
*  And they're clearly very, very sad, right?
*  And we wanna say to them, like, it's no big deal.
*  Or everyone's picked last sometimes.
*  Or remember yesterday you told me
*  you were picked first for basketball.
*  And we think like, I need to build up my kid's confidence.
*  Those are confidence,
*  I wanna say destroying us, reducing interventions.
*  Cause a kid is kind of coming to a parent,
*  basically saying, I'm very, very upset
*  that I was picked last.
*  And we're saying to a kid, no, you weren't.
*  And they're like, but I am.
*  And what they learn is, and this is really terrifying to me,
*  is other people are better feelers of my feelings than I am.
*  And that has like a million really scary interpersonal,
*  I think relationship, kind of consequences later down,
*  later down in life.
*  But when a kid says, I was picked last
*  and nobody even wants me,
*  and they all think I'm the worst athlete,
*  whatever kids say, to sit and say some version of like,
*  I'm so glad we're talking about this.
*  And I could tell that was a really hard gym class.
*  And sweetie, like, I believe you.
*  You will watch your kid.
*  It is crazy to me what parents tell me happen
*  when they say those words to their kids.
*  It also just like literally diffused everything
*  and they were like ready to move on.
*  They are just trying to tell you probably,
*  I was feeling something, it was a lot, it was confusing.
*  Our feelings are always hardest when we're alone in them.
*  So I was alone in it and I bring it to you.
*  When someone says, I believe you,
*  not only are they giving you that core need,
*  they're also just like,
*  they're like sitting down with you in it.
*  And that makes everything better.
*  And then meanwhile, what a kid feels like
*  when we say, I believe you,
*  it's like going to a hard experience or hard feeling is,
*  they're like the feelings that overwhelm me
*  don't overwhelm my parents.
*  They can tolerate it.
*  They're not scared of me kind of being a loser
*  in gym class one day.
*  And if my parent likes me, when I have that feeling,
*  like I can start to like myself when I have that feeling.
*  It's so great because it sounds like
*  it accomplishes both things.
*  It makes kids feel real and safe.
*  Yes.
*  Real and safe.
*  And I can't help but ask, say,
*  because how we started off today
*  was that this isn't just about parent-child relationships,
*  but in friendships, in romantic relationships,
*  in coworker relationships,
*  that the words, I believe you,
*  I have to presume based on everything I'm hearing now
*  and feeling inside about it,
*  that it's equally effective.
*  Huge.
*  Years ago I was on like a podcast early on
*  and to me there are these three lines
*  that kind of all go together when kids are,
*  anyone's upset and it's kind of like you start,
*  and to me it's like a beautiful invitation
*  to have that conversation just to say to someone,
*  I'm so glad you're talking to me about this.
*  Right, and then kind of, I believe you, tell me more.
*  And my husband, when he heard it, was like,
*  no, you could like say those words to me sometimes.
*  Like I would like that because,
*  and I think about the workplace too.
*  Like you have someone come in, they're upset about,
*  I don't know, I got staffed on this
*  or I'm not getting a promotion and I thought I was,
*  just diffuse it with just,
*  I'm so glad you're talking to me about this.
*  Yeah, I've been working nonstop.
*  And just if you say to them, I believe you.
*  Because we usually don't say to someone,
*  I don't believe you.
*  But what we'll say is we defend ourselves in that moment
*  and the way the other person receives it
*  is as if we're saying, I don't believe the intensity
*  of the experience you're having.
*  And when you do lead with I believe you,
*  same thing in a partnership.
*  Every time I ask you to do something,
*  you get really hot and bothered.
*  Like it doesn't even mean you agree.
*  You're kind of just believing, like I believe you.
*  Like tell me more.
*  Or I believe you that that really upset you.
*  And like I'm obviously, I have a whole other story
*  in my head, but like I hear what you're saying
*  and I know there's something there
*  and I believe it enough to like be open
*  to hearing more about it.
*  I don't know, that's like what's best.
*  That's what we all want in our partnerships.
*  I mean, I'm wide-eyed.
*  What a beautiful acknowledgement that as you pointed out
*  is not agreeing to accept someone else's reality
*  to the extent that you're going to dismantle
*  the order of the world or whatever it is.
*  But it's such an opening as opposed to a closing.
*  And as you said, it's non-defended, but it's also boundaried.
*  I mean, there's just so many things about it
*  that feel good, seem good and clearly are good.
*  I don't want to go down the tragic rabbit hole of trauma,
*  but previous guest on this podcast,
*  we should probably define trauma
*  just because it gets thrown around a lot.
*  Trauma in event or set of circumstances
*  that fundamentally change the way that the brain
*  and nervous system works so that
*  there's a maladaptive response going forward.
*  It's not every bad thing that happens.
*  But there are micro traumas sometimes called small T
*  or macro traumas.
*  Big T again could be multi-event or single event.
*  But years ago, a different psychologist psychiatrist,
*  there's an adolescent psychiatrist at Stanford
*  said something in a seminar that just really struck me,
*  which was that at its core,
*  trauma is really about confusion over who's responsible.
*  And here we're not just talking about
*  the more salient examples of like sexual assault,
*  those two of course,
*  but like if we get screamed at
*  or we observe something like third person trauma,
*  like the logical stance is,
*  well, okay, that was them, not me.
*  But when this happens, especially when we're young,
*  the nervous system, the brain somehow interprets this as
*  like I was there, I had a role in it just by being there.
*  So like, what was my role?
*  And somehow the emotional response
*  becomes one of responsibility, even if we know like,
*  they're clearly the one that initiated this.
*  And so the reason I'm bringing this up in this context
*  is that it's almost like that lack of belief in self
*  somehow gets rooted in and then it all feels confusing
*  and then we don't feel safe.
*  That's right.
*  Because it's a confusion about responsibility.
*  Again, going back to this, these words.
*  Can we go down that rabbit hole for a second?
*  Please, please, that's why I raised it.
*  I think that-
*  I want your thoughts, not mine.
*  I always think trauma is actually not events.
*  It's the way an event gets processed.
*  And I love Gabor Matei's definition of trauma.
*  It's not what happens to you.
*  It's what happens inside of you, right?
*  So to me, there's an inherent relationality there
*  where events that get processed, not any event,
*  events with high emotionality, let's say,
*  that get processed in aloneness become traumatic.
*  And I think that's where it gets linked to responsibility.
*  So this is actually what my TED talk was about
*  and why repair is so important.
*  Who said this?
*  Ronald Fairburn years ago, that for kids,
*  it is better to be a sinner in a world ruled by God
*  than to live in a world ruled by the devil.
*  I think it explains almost everything
*  about child development right there.
*  Going back to goodness also,
*  your parent just screamed at you.
*  And by the way, your parent, I scream at my kids.
*  Everyone's gonna scream at their kids.
*  It's gonna happen, okay?
*  That's just the event.
*  The event's not gonna have the impact.
*  What is happening for a kid?
*  Well, we know kids are oriented by attachment.
*  They literally need us to survive.
*  Like they could not survive on their own.
*  And so what do you do when the person you're dependent on
*  for safety becomes the source of danger and threat?
*  That's very confusing for a child in that moment.
*  So they're super hyper aroused.
*  They're in the state of terror.
*  And then usually after in my house too,
*  I just yell at my kid.
*  They're kind of alone in their room.
*  I'm alone in the kitchen or wherever.
*  Meanwhile spinning, I'm such a bad parent.
*  But meanwhile, because I'm so lost in my own guilt,
*  I might not be going to my kid.
*  And so what happens for my kid if I don't repair
*  after I scream at them or one of these events, right?
*  Well, a kid cannot say to themselves,
*  my parent just had a bad day.
*  Then the badness is in my parent.
*  My leader, I'm young now, right?
*  Like I don't understand nuance.
*  My leader can't be bad.
*  So I must take on the badness.
*  At least then I have control.
*  So kids, after they're kind of yelled at,
*  in the absence of repair,
*  they really only have two options for how to regulate
*  and feel safe again.
*  They can self blame, it's all my fault,
*  which is why I feel like most adults,
*  when they have a hard time,
*  they tell themselves like it's my fault.
*  I'm not good enough.
*  It's like the legacy of that story from childhood.
*  Or they use self doubt.
*  Maybe that didn't happen.
*  Maybe I overreacted.
*  Maybe I can't trust myself.
*  Again, it leads to adults who basically say like,
*  did I overreact or let me call five friends.
*  Let me see if they think what my boyfriend did
*  was a big deal.
*  Because they can't trust themselves.
*  And so trauma, what I want every parent to know is they'll
*  say, I left my kid alone and I didn't pick them up
*  at the soccer field.
*  Is that going to traumatize them?
*  And I'll say, well, that's just the event.
*  Like, did you say to them, hey, that probably felt scary.
*  What was that like?
*  Oh, you're right.
*  Like you were alone.
*  Now all of a sudden next to the event that was scary
*  is my story and my connection.
*  It got processed in a safe connection.
*  It didn't get processed in aloneness.
*  And that's a massive, massive difference.
*  In this scenario, you are describing the parent who yelled
*  goes to the child, having been that child,
*  and perhaps also having been that parent.
*  How do we deal with the fact that sometimes,
*  you know, we don't want to be around the person
*  that yelled at us.
*  It hurts to receive the care.
*  There's like a textured landscape as opposed
*  to a smooth landscape there.
*  Like, okay, now you're ready for everything to be peaceful.
*  I'm still with my feelings.
*  I guess that's where the, I believe you comes in.
*  And that's where the sorting it through process begins.
*  Is that right?
*  Yeah, well, I think it's like what version
*  of a parent comes back.
*  To me, the first thing we have to do in a repair process
*  is actually repair with ourselves as a parent, really.
*  Because if you haven't repaired with yourself,
*  which to me is kind of separating your identity again
*  from your behavior, like, okay, Becky,
*  I'll use myself as an example.
*  I'm a good parent who just screamed at her son.
*  Like, I did not mess up forever.
*  And you see when you try to repair with yourself,
*  those two things get collapsed.
*  I'm like, I messed him up forever.
*  I'm a monster.
*  Wait, like, I'm a good parent
*  who did something I'm not proud of.
*  You can't repair with someone
*  until you've repaired with yourself.
*  They feel it from you.
*  They actually, it usually is like,
*  then you're asking for them.
*  I'll be like, it's okay, right?
*  Like, you forgive me, right?
*  That's not a repair.
*  That's like using your child to try to do something
*  we just have to do on our own or with other adults.
*  But if I've repaired with myself,
*  I'm gonna show up in a different way.
*  Might I have a feisty kid?
*  I might.
*  I don't care.
*  It's not better.
*  That's okay.
*  I'm not repairing to get something for my child.
*  I'm repairing to give an experience to them.
*  So we can also get creative.
*  You know, your kid is older.
*  You text them.
*  You slip a door under the note.
*  You say, okay, I just have to say this one thing.
*  To me, this line really matters
*  to like snatch that self-blame out of a kid's body.
*  Like, I'm sorry I yelled.
*  It is never your fault when I yell.
*  And it's not.
*  And people who argue,
*  like our ability to regulate our emotions
*  predated our child's existence.
*  Like that, you know, like they had something.
*  They did something.
*  And we felt frustrated.
*  But that's very different than yelling, right?
*  And saying that to your kid is so important.
*  Meanwhile, the next day you might say, by the way,
*  let's really figure out how to get out the door
*  in a smoother way.
*  You know, you could work on whatever they need to work on.
*  But the reason I think most kids
*  end up rejecting parents' apologies
*  is it's not really a repair.
*  We're asking our kid for permission to be okay again.
*  Or our repair sounds like, hey, I'm sorry I yelled,
*  but you know, like if you just got ready in time,
*  that wouldn't have happened.
*  Or we say, I'm sorry you felt that way.
*  I'm sorry you felt that way.
*  Those are not, like none of those are actually repairs.
*  And if that's what a kid's been used to,
*  they're gonna keep a parent more at bay.
*  So is it safe to say that we can always come back
*  to making the kid feel real and safe?
*  I believe you as a great place to start.
*  And the reason I keep coming back to these simple things
*  is that, simple but very, very potent, by the way,
*  is that in the real world landscape
*  of parenting, family, and life,
*  things are happening really fast.
*  And it's very dynamic.
*  And it's multifaceted.
*  I mean, we haven't even talked yet
*  when there's two parents, like the one that didn't yell.
*  When there's multiple siblings,
*  I mean, there's the human dynamics
*  in an other landscape is hard enough.
*  And then when you start introducing the real world landscape,
*  things happen fast.
*  So having something that people can reach to really quickly,
*  what I call in the landscape of stress modulation,
*  which is something that I'm more familiar with
*  from my lab's work, is real-time tools.
*  Real-time tools.
*  We're all at our best after meditation, vacation,
*  massage, and a good night's sleep.
*  But what about real-time tools when everything's hectic?
*  So what does a really good apology look like
*  in the real world?
*  Because a really good apology in the ideal world
*  of Instagram is, yeah, I believe you.
*  I'm so sorry with no buts, no this and that.
*  But a real apology sometimes is as you're boarding a plane
*  or when there's a bunch of other things that are going on
*  and you haven't even dealt with those yet,
*  or when you're on your way to an event or you're, okay,
*  so you get it.
*  What does a really good internal landscape
*  for apology look like?
*  Like how can we touch into where we need to be?
*  And then what are the words that,
*  even if we have to try again later and again
*  and again later with that person, in this case kid,
*  but person more generally,
*  what's the go-to solid apology?
*  So yeah, I think you're never gonna go wrong saying,
*  I believe you to your kid.
*  Like obviously not if you say it randomly,
*  but if they're really upset, you yelled at me,
*  I believe you, like if that's all you can remember,
*  you're crushing it.
*  I think a realistic repair,
*  you have to do something for yourself.
*  And like to me, it can be a very simple mantra.
*  Like to me, I'm a good parent who is having a hard time
*  is the one I use, honestly.
*  Over and over, just, and after I yell at my kid before,
*  I'll like go to the bathroom sometimes
*  and I'll say that to myself, Becky,
*  like I'm a good parent having a hard time.
*  And I'll kind of say it as many times as I need
*  until I really do feel something
*  like shift a little in my body.
*  Just, because again, I think that phrase separates
*  what I did from who I am, right?
*  And then to me, a realistic apology,
*  it can be super simple.
*  If you remember nothing else, you could just be like,
*  I'm sorry I yelled.
*  That's great.
*  If you're like, I'm feeling it, Becky,
*  give me that next step.
*  I'm sorry I yelled.
*  Just like you, I'm working on managing my emotions.
*  And next time, even when I'm frustrated,
*  I'm gonna try to stay calm.
*  Something about the next time,
*  if you wanna throw in that it's not your fault.
*  Kids, it seems an odd thing because parents are like,
*  do kids assume it's their fault?
*  It is their default position.
*  And so it's never a bad thing to throw in.
*  But honestly, just simply, hey, I'm sorry I yelled.
*  That actually gives them that realness
*  because without saying anything more,
*  you're saying that thing you think happened did happen.
*  So that's powerful.
*  I'd like to take a quick break
*  and thank our sponsor InsideTracker.
*  InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
*  that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
*  to help you better understand your body
*  and help you reach your health goals.
*  I've long been a believer
*  in getting regular blood work done
*  for the simple reason that many of the factors
*  that impact your immediate and long-term health
*  can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.
*  Now a major problem with a lot of blood tests out there,
*  however, is that you get information back
*  about metabolic factors, lipids and hormones and so forth,
*  but you don't know what to do with that information.
*  With InsideTracker, they make it very easy
*  because they have a personalized platform
*  that allows you to see the levels of all those things,
*  metabolic factors, lipids, hormones, et cetera,
*  but it gives you specific directives that you can follow
*  that relate to nutrition, behavioral modification,
*  supplements, et cetera, that can help you bring those numbers
*  into the ranges that are optimal for you.
*  If you'd like to try InsideTracker,
*  you can go to insidetracker.com slash Huberman

*  How do you suggest parents deal with retorts and rudeness?
*  And again, let's extend this to all relationships.
*  So you get in your best mindset,
*  and by the way, I love this I am thing,
*  two of the most important words in any language
*  when translated to other languages.
*  I am blank, I am a good this,
*  or I am whatever role identity is key to the brain.
*  We know this.
*  You go in and you say, I'm really sorry.
*  I struggled to regulate my emotions.
*  I believe that you're really upset.
*  And the kid says, I hate you.
*  Now, earlier you said that good boundaries
*  are about not expecting a change in behavior
*  from someone else, they're about our own boundaries.
*  So, or maybe the I hate you comes from,
*  listen, we're not gonna go to so-and-so's house
*  for a play date today.
*  Great example, I hate you.
*  I hate you.
*  So is there ever a case for no response?
*  I mean, to me, the most underutilized parenting strategy
*  is doing nothing, literally.
*  It's one of my most used strategies
*  because there's really good reason for it,
*  especially in this situation.
*  So I always, to me, I would say we have to understand
*  before we intervene.
*  So I know every parent's like,
*  what do you do in that situation?
*  But it's like trying to fix someone's tennis swing
*  before you look at their tennis swing, right?
*  There could be a lot of problems.
*  So again, why is a kid saying I hate you?
*  And I would ask every parent to just keep this in mind.
*  It's a tool, and you can't use it in real time.
*  Eventually you can, but we have to say it
*  at the end of the night.
*  When my kid said I hate you,
*  what is my most generous interpretation
*  of why he would say that to me?
*  And if you're like any human, me included, by the way,
*  your least generous interpretation is immediate.
*  You're like, because he's a sociopath.
*  That's what we say all the time.
*  We're like, wow, or because he's a horrible kid,
*  because he's spoiled, because he's nasty.
*  It comes easily.
*  So that's fine.
*  But what is my most generous interpretation?
*  And when I don't know, I'll push myself to say,
*  okay, well, like I was in a situation with my husband.
*  What would lead me to say that?
*  What would lead you to say that to someone?
*  That I hate them?
*  Yeah, like they like say something to you like,
*  hey, Andrew, we're not gonna be able to do this dinner.
*  It would have to be some sort of deep betrayal of trust.
*  And I have to acknowledge that if I said that to somebody
*  that I really care about or love,
*  as I'm saying, I hate you, what I'm really saying is,
*  I love you so much.
*  And that hurts unbelievably at such an unbelievable
*  intensity that what's coming out of my mouth is I hate you.
*  Because if you didn't love them,
*  That's right.
*  It would have no effect.
*  It would be a meh.
*  It would be a meh.
*  But instead it's a, ugh, it hurts.
*  So we somehow there's a neural circuit in there
*  that goes, you know, I, whatever, insert, expletive,
*  hate you.
*  That's right.
*  And what I'm really saying is I love you so much.
*  Yeah.
*  And as a consequence, that thing you did or said
*  hurts so much.
*  That's right.
*  And so I think that's like exactly what's going on
*  for a kid.
*  Or like to me, my most generous interpretation
*  a simple way is my kid, when I said we couldn't go
*  to this friend's house that he thought we were going to,
*  his friend, he was gonna sleep over.
*  He had like so built it up in his mind.
*  He'd like probably like kids do like they have this
*  whole image, oh, and then we're gonna do this and this.
*  And like the letdown was so intense.
*  And again, I go back to kids have all the feelings we have
*  and they're born with none of the skills.
*  So it takes a lot of, it takes like a pretty well developed
*  skill to be really disappointed by the way and surprised,
*  right, in the moment and like manage it in like a mature way.
*  I'm sure we both know adults who aren't really capable
*  of doing that, right?
*  So the fact that my seven year old is doing that.
*  So if I think about it that way,
*  we latch onto our kids words as if they're the truth.
*  They're not the truth.
*  It's not to say they don't matter,
*  but they're not the truth.
*  The truth is whatever world is under the words.
*  Like I'm disappointed and I don't know how to manage that.
*  So if I think about the outcome,
*  like what do I wanna be?
*  What I would love in that situation.
*  Because the truth is when I say to my kid, sorry,
*  we can't go to Bobby's house.
*  I wouldn't even want, it's not normal for my kid to be like,
*  oh, no problem.
*  Because like I'm just picturing my 25 year old
*  trying to get a job and being like,
*  mom, oh, I didn't get it.
*  And then he's like, no problem.
*  I'm like, that's kind of weird.
*  Really?
*  That's weird.
*  I'd want you to be disappointed.
*  And so what I want my kid to be able to do
*  is to be like, I don't know, what's the best it gets.
*  Oh man, I was really looking forward to that.
*  That's like ultimate maturity.
*  So how do I get from I hate you to,
*  oh man, I was really looking forward to that.
*  All the things we wanna do just don't even make sense.
*  Sending my kid to their room saying like,
*  you're such a nasty kid.
*  I've never seen any of your friends say that
*  to their parents.
*  And I'm good at acting these things out
*  because of course I say these things too.
*  But all I'm doing is basically telling my kid
*  the version of themselves I don't want them to be.
*  So now I'm further away from that outcome,
*  just not effective.
*  My kid obviously literally needs to learn
*  some of those skills and practice them.
*  We don't think about simulations with kids nearly enough.
*  We know that in sports.
*  People practice all the time.
*  We don't do that with emotion regulation.
*  So what do I do in the moment?
*  I think the best question here is,
*  what do I do outside the moment
*  to help my kid build the skills
*  so they actually have more of a skill
*  the next time that moment comes?
*  Still, I'm a pragmatist.
*  What do I do in the moment?
*  I hate you.
*  I probably would do nothing first.
*  When someone is rude to you
*  and they say something nasty,
*  I don't know, this is my son, this is me.
*  My son just hurled, I hate you.
*  It's like sitting between us.
*  When we say back to them,
*  I hate you, or like go to your room.
*  We take all the energy from what they said
*  and we just like throw it.
*  And then like we have this ping pong match.
*  When you do nothing, I always picture
*  if this is like that I hate you,
*  it just sits between us.
*  My kid has a much higher chance
*  of kind of re-owning what they just said
*  because I'm just kind of sturdy in that moment
*  because I didn't just take it from them
*  and say something to them,
*  which just gives them the opportunity
*  to like take what I said
*  and have no responsibility for the first thing they said.
*  It's always true in adults.
*  When someone says to you like something nasty,
*  if you actually just stay there,
*  they're kind of like, oh shoot,
*  like I shouldn't have said that
*  because like it's right there.
*  So I'd probably say nothing.
*  Now a couple, I don't know if I'd really do that,
*  but I'd want to do that, let me be clear.
*  Something else you can say in that moment,
*  which takes a lot of presence
*  so it's not gonna happen right away,
*  is just something like, whoa,
*  like clearly you're disappointed.
*  I get that.
*  I believe you and I know there's another way
*  you can say that to me.
*  That's actually right back to family jobs.
*  I'm validating and I'm setting kind of a boundary
*  in some ways, like I know maybe there's a hope there too,
*  like I know there's another way.
*  If my kid keeps saying, I hate you, I hate you,
*  you're the worst, you're the worst,
*  then I'm gonna say, listen, I love you,
*  you're a good kid, you're having a hard time.
*  I really won't stay in your room
*  while you keep saying this to me.
*  And part of that is because it's not good for you either.
*  Like this isn't a good dynamic,
*  I'm gonna step outside, I'm gonna come back
*  and we can talk about it when we're both in a place
*  where we can be a little more respectful
*  or something like that, right?
*  You don't have to be a punching bag.
*  But at least now, I'm helping my kid see
*  that he is having a feeling under these words.
*  If I can't differentiate the feeling from the behavior,
*  how can I expect my kid to ever learn
*  to differentiate those two?
*  Which is how my kid can actually get
*  to a more regulated place.
*  I've sometimes wondered whether or not parents
*  are either afraid of or not afraid enough of their kids.
*  I've known some parents that are afraid of their kids
*  because, and perhaps as a consequence,
*  who knows what the chicken egg is there,
*  all we know is the parent was alive first.
*  The kids learn to control their parents
*  through not necessarily emotional outbursts,
*  but the threat of emotional outbursts.
*  I've seen this again and again,
*  and it's a pretty wild thing to observe.
*  And of course, as an observer,
*  it's far easier than when you're in it.
*  But this idea like, whoa, like they're ready to boil over,
*  like they're gonna pop.
*  And I've seen this in teachers in the classroom.
*  I've seen this in so many venues where,
*  whether or not the child understands
*  that they're somehow controlling the situation or not,
*  there's just an inherent fear of what could happen.
*  And then I think kids feel a certain power,
*  but they don't feel safe, right?
*  I mean, how could they?
*  They're children.
*  Yes.
*  So for the parents out there that are afraid
*  of their kids' potential responses
*  and or how bad their kid quote unquote might turn out
*  if they were to really lay down the law,
*  I'm using kind of old school language.
*  Listen, I grew up, I'm 48 years old.
*  So, yeah, I mean, my parents didn't physically abuse us,
*  but there might have been a spanking every once in a while.
*  I don't know what the rule is nowadays
*  or the standard out there.
*  I think I won't say which way,
*  I might've taken a smack here or there, but not many.
*  And there was also a lot of love.
*  But clearly, and here I'm not supporting
*  the use of corporal punishment.
*  I want to be very clear.
*  But kids can be tough.
*  And then also, it wasn't long into my high school years
*  when I was physically larger than both my parents.
*  I never used that to intimidate them.
*  But I have to imagine when your kid is larger than you,
*  if you were already psychologically afraid of them,
*  now it's clear to both of you that the tables have turned.
*  That's right.
*  Right?
*  I'm talking about the unconscious,
*  semi-conscious aspects of this.
*  I'm not talking about who can, obviously, physical fights.
*  There's not something I ever want to see
*  or participate in a household.
*  So this is an amazing topic, like walking on eggshells.
*  This is right.
*  And this is terrifying to a kid.
*  Because again, if a kid is trying to figure out,
*  am I real and am I safe?
*  Kids do experience feelings in such an intense way
*  because they don't have any of those skills
*  and they're so surprising and they're so visceral,
*  that it is scary to them.
*  And there are kind of especially these groups of kids,
*  I call them deeply feeling kids,
*  that do feel things more intensely.
*  And they do have more of these big, massive tantrums.
*  They even look animalistic.
*  Often during they try to scratch you,
*  they'll hiss during them, they'll growl.
*  Hiss, really?
*  Yes.
*  I grew up with some biters.
*  Yeah.
*  Kids that bite.
*  Yes, because again, those are just feelings
*  literally uncontained that are exploding out.
*  And where do they explode out?
*  Through your extremities.
*  So that's really what it is.
*  And so what will happen,
*  and this is this really unfortunate day
*  and it's one of my favorite things
*  to help people turn around,
*  is then kids kind of sense from a parent,
*  like I really am as toxic as I worried I was.
*  Right?
*  And again, if we go back to that pilot thing,
*  like I think about a pilot,
*  it's like we have to make an emergency landing.
*  We're not gonna be able to go to LA
*  and we're all gonna land in Cleveland, whatever it is.
*  I picture the passenger who's like,
*  you are going to take us to LA.
*  And the pilot's like, okay, okay.
*  Can you imagine?
*  You're like, it doesn't matter that this person is pissed.
*  Like you're the pilot.
*  You don't have to keep us happy.
*  Please keep us safe.
*  And if you're on that plane and you're terrified
*  because you have to make an emergency landing,
*  I promise you you're way more terrified
*  when you hear this person change the decision
*  because of the threat that a passenger
*  is going to be very, very upset.
*  And that is actually what we do
*  when we're walking around on eggshells.
*  Now, the alternative to this, again,
*  we live in this world on parenting
*  where there's a binary where we say,
*  and you said it yourself, so I'm gonna lay down the law.
*  Like, I don't recommend that either.
*  Like, especially with a kid like that,
*  that's not gonna be the best solution.
*  These kids have to be seen as good kids.
*  They are good kids.
*  And when I meet with parents of these kids,
*  I hear about them.
*  And like, I always say, I hear about them.
*  And I have a kid like this, so I get it.
*  And I'm just like, I really like your kid.
*  And they're like, what?
*  I was like, I do.
*  And they're like, and then they usually start crying
*  and they go, you're literally the first person in 11 years
*  who's ever said that, including like the parents.
*  Like, you like our kid, why?
*  I'm like, they're tenacious.
*  They're, they know what they want.
*  They seem like they have 0% people pleasing in them.
*  These kids will change the world,
*  but not if they're boundaryless,
*  then they'll become tyrants.
*  And that's really terrifying.
*  And I'm gonna teach you how to be the sturdy leader,
*  which is equally firm as it is warm.
*  And that's gonna start today.
*  And so like, here's an example of these deeply feeling kids.
*  I think he said something about like watching like
*  a TV show where these kids,
*  it feels like they hold the family emotionally hostage,
*  right?
*  And because if you don't pick the movie
*  that they wanna watch on family movie night,
*  they will scream, they will cry.
*  And they will do that for three hours.
*  They will.
*  Other kids after you're like,
*  they don't peter out these kids.
*  These kids, interestingly enough,
*  get in an awful cycle with their parents
*  because they have such intense emotions more often,
*  which more escalations,
*  which tend to get met with invalidation.
*  You're so dramatic.
*  You ruin everything.
*  They are that much more desperate to be believed.
*  They escalate further.
*  You can understand how that will lead to more distance
*  and invalidation.
*  And we're off to the races in a bad direction.
*  And I would say to the parents,
*  during family movie night, tomorrow night,
*  this is what you're gonna do.
*  And you're gonna, by the way, I would say it.
*  This is how concrete I get.
*  You're gonna write this down
*  and you're gonna say it to a voice recorder
*  with your own voice.
*  And I want you to play it back
*  and see how sturdy you sound.
*  And they'll often do it and they'll be like,
*  wow, I didn't even believe myself when I said that.
*  I'm so scared of my child, right?
*  You're gonna do it again.
*  And then you're gonna do it again.
*  And this is just like any other skill we practice.
*  And you're gonna say to your kid,
*  look, I know in this family,
*  Bobby, usually we let him pick the movie.
*  He gets really upset.
*  If not, well, y'all, tonight's gonna be different.
*  Bobby, it is your sister's turn to pick the movie.
*  And I know you're gonna be upset.
*  And I just wanna tell you exactly what's gonna happen.
*  And I'm gonna, in this example,
*  I'm saying there's a two-family household,
*  which is an assumption.
*  But even if there's one,
*  if you're super upset and screaming,
*  I'm going to bring you to your room.
*  And this is important.
*  I'm gonna sit with you.
*  And I'm gonna stay there.
*  And this is a line that I know
*  from our deeply feeling kid workshop has really,
*  and you have to believe it to say it.
*  I am not scared of your feelings.
*  And I know parents will say to me,
*  but Dr. Becky, I am scared of their feelings.
*  I'm like, yeah, you're gonna fake it till you make it.
*  They need to hear that.
*  Because if you think about the image of these kids,
*  their feelings feel so overpowering to them.
*  They feel more.
*  But they're actually more porous to the world.
*  So they both have more coming in.
*  And they're actually always terrified
*  of how much of them can flow out.
*  And so they feel their feelings that way.
*  It's almost like my tantrum in the house
*  takes up the entire living room.
*  That's why you actually have to bring them to a smaller room.
*  And you actually have to contain them in that way
*  as a way of kind of saying,
*  it only goes this far, literally.
*  I will not let you dictate family movie
*  and always sitting in the front seat
*  in your favorite chair at dinner.
*  It only goes this far.
*  And that is truly an act of love and protection
*  and safety for those kids.
*  How often do you observe that these deeply feeling kids,
*  is that how they're referred to?
*  Yep.
*  I mean, I made up the term, so, but yeah.
*  Great.
*  Deeply feeling kids, yes.
*  You are qualified to, qualified to.
*  So deeply feeling kids also express these
*  deep feelings in the positive sense.
*  I mean, cause I can think of some kids I grew up with
*  and I can look at my own experience of like,
*  it's hard to know.
*  We don't have a calibration point.
*  It's not like body temperature of like how much I feel
*  versus how much you feel.
*  We look at the external expression of these things.
*  Like did the lacrimal glands secrete some tears or not?
*  Like, you know, as you were talking about this thing
*  before I noticed, I like welled up a little bit
*  and I'm thinking, yeah, like I can remember seeing things
*  and feeling things and like, whoa, it's a really big inside.
*  I don't remember screaming at my parents telling them
*  I hate them.
*  I probably did at some point, but,
*  but I have observed other kids, peers that grew up,
*  that clearly fell into this category
*  and have gone on to do remarkable things.
*  Yes. Remarkable.
*  Like extraordinary things because it's a capacity
*  that doesn't always skew towards a negative expression.
*  It can also like immense expressions of love
*  and you know, I think these days that there's a tendency
*  to for unqualified or like truly unqualified people
*  because they're not trained to do so to slap labels
*  like borderline, right?
*  Splitting like good object, bad object splitting
*  and indeed that exists as a diagnosis
*  and symptoms of borderline,
*  but that we punish rather than believe and observe
*  that these things exist.
*  There's range in nervous system tuning and affect.
*  And so put simply do deeply feeling kids also tend
*  to express love and joy and positive emotions
*  with the same intensity or near same intensity.
*  I would say it depends on like,
*  it depends on kind of their stage of development
*  and the nature of the interactions
*  they've kind of received back.
*  I think deeply feeling kids, I always say are super sensors.
*  Like if you have one of these kids and I have one of these
*  kids, we live in New York city,
*  she will not go into New York city garage, okay?
*  Like where we park our car and she's like the smell
*  and the rest of us are like, what are you talking about?
*  Meanwhile, I have another friend who lives
*  in totally different area of Manhattan
*  and she's a deeply feeling kid.
*  She's like my daughter, the same thing.
*  Like I actually believe that my daughter smells something
*  that I don't smell.
*  Like they are super sensors in that way, right?
*  And she notices the little detail of something.
*  Now in terms of the intense love, I think for these kids
*  their vulnerability sits so close to their shame.
*  This is why they get so explosive.
*  They almost experience their feelings as attackers,
*  which is again why parents can get scared of them.
*  And they do because again, they feel that feeling
*  so intensely that they have this deep fear of abandonment,
*  of being too much.
*  And so that shame tries to shut it down,
*  although it obviously doesn't work and it explodes.
*  What I've noticed with deeply feeling kids
*  and this to me is actually like truly
*  my proudest body of work.
*  And you mentioned borderline, so we'll go there.
*  People have said like these sound almost like kids
*  who are like have some predilection to borderline.
*  And obviously having gone to a PhD program,
*  we're told a lot about invalidating environments
*  and things like that.
*  I'm not really one for labels either.
*  But I just got so much insight from my,
*  honestly my own kid where I was like, wow,
*  like she is so different in how she processes things
*  and what she needs and how she responds
*  to my very same interactions as my other kids.
*  Like they're very different and that fear of abandonment
*  and being too much, it was like,
*  it was like there from the start.
*  It really feels like it was like there.
*  What's so interesting is I feel like through working
*  with her by the way in a very different way,
*  because these kids reject almost every typical
*  parenting strategy.
*  You go to validate these kids' feelings,
*  it's like you're trying to intrude on them
*  and steal their heart.
*  Because if you think about their porousness,
*  they're so terrified of being taken over
*  that when you're like seeing a feeling,
*  they feel like you're like seeing into them.
*  And so they reject you.
*  I always say you can't go in the front door with these kids.
*  You've got to like find these side door approaches.
*  But now of all my kids, she is by far the cuddliest,
*  the most loving, the most emphatic
*  about our relationship up this trip.
*  Now I'm gonna miss you so much.
*  Like the idea when she was four that any of that,
*  I would say to someone like, you are crazy.
*  You are talking about a different kid.
*  So I think that yes, that deep love is there.
*  And we just have to kind of make it a little safer
*  for those kids to access it.
*  Is there any kind of general statements
*  that one can still make accurately
*  about differences in the expression
*  or perhaps even the experience of deeply feeling kids
*  in boys versus girls?
*  Hmm, great question.
*  I actually haven't noticed a ton.
*  There might be, I'd love to look more into that.
*  But in terms of, I want to be accurate.
*  I haven't noticed that yet.
*  I think one of the things you know you have
*  one of these kids is if you know the moments
*  when you're a parent where your kid like needs you.
*  Like there, and in those moments, your kids push you away.
*  They push you away when they need you the most.
*  If that's like, I think a really common quality
*  for those kids.
*  And how common is this?
*  I sound like such a, like a biologist,
*  this deeply feeling kid, a phenotype.
*  I don't want to, you know, I don't want to lessen
*  the importance of what you're saying
*  by saying it that way.
*  Because actually what I think you're saying
*  is incredibly important.
*  Resonates with me on a lot of different levels in fact.
*  So, but as far as I know, it's not a DSM diagnosis.
*  And thank goodness it's not
*  because that would pathologize it.
*  That's right. Right?
*  Yep.
*  So, but you know, of the, you know, in a classroom,
*  let's say we get a big classroom, a hundred kids.
*  Yeah.
*  How many of those kids, and I'm guessing it's a continuum,
*  but would fall into this category of deeply feeling?
*  I think you're right.
*  It's a continuum and connecting topics
*  I know you've spoken about.
*  I've been doing a lot of looking into this overlap
*  with deeply feeling kids and neurodivergence
*  and ADHD.
*  And what I think is interesting about that is
*  we have these workshops,
*  these deeply feeling kid workshops,
*  and a lot of them we do live
*  and there's this whole chat, right?
*  And I'll say these things, people like that, you know,
*  and they're definitely ideas they haven't heard,
*  but what I think is more healing
*  is thousands of people in the chat and saying,
*  I thought when I say the hissing thing,
*  the chat is like a waterfall.
*  I thought I was the only one I thought.
*  So like, there are so many of these kids.
*  Why I think there's more and more
*  is something I need to look more into,
*  but I think it does really,
*  if you think about these kids as more porous
*  and you think about how insanely stimulating the world is
*  that we bring up kids, what comes into them,
*  it would make sense that I think this is like a growing type.
*  I'm guessing it's similar with ADHD too.
*  There are so many more kids diagnosed than in the past.
*  The world we bring up kids in, the sensory overload,
*  if you're kind of that much more porous,
*  that's going to overload your system.
*  And, you know, it's, and I think that,
*  I think that's also why more and more kids are.
*  So what's the percentage?
*  I don't know, like maybe 20, but that-
*  That's a fairly high percentage.
*  I do, I think it's a fairly high percentage.
*  But that feels right.
*  It just sort of feels right
*  based on my observation of adults also.
*  Yeah.
*  Feels right, might also explain a lot of the
*  apparent conflicts and misunderstandings
*  in adult relationships.
*  That's exactly, and we, I mean, so many people,
*  like they'll say to me, I was, oh my goodness,
*  like that was like years of therapy for me watching that.
*  I thought I would took that for my kid.
*  Like this was me and I finally, talking about I believe you,
*  that's what, I mean, deeply feeling kids are desperate
*  to be believed and they're desperate for our attempts
*  to connect with them because their deep fear
*  is their unlovability.
*  And so they do reject typical, you know, it's a stance.
*  Get out of my room, fine, you're so difficult.
*  And then see, I really am as unlovable and bad
*  as I worried I was, right?
*  Unless we kind of reverse that cycle.
*  I'd be willing to bet my life
*  that most of the ultra successful performing artists
*  that we observe, I'm not gonna name names,
*  but just think of ultra successful
*  that the people whose words, music, poetry,
*  writing, acting, presence evokes immense emotion
*  in other people so much that people will pay money
*  to see these people express their emotions
*  and what's inside them fall
*  into this deeply feeling category.
*  100%.
*  I mean, it just can't be any other way.
*  Right.
*  Yeah, the muted performer, unless that's the shtick,
*  so to speak, is just not compelling.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, and a lot of what we're talking today
*  is about the kind of tuning fork nature of emotions.
*  It's a, wow, what a tricky balance.
*  Speaking of that, I'd like to just return
*  to something I raised earlier and then I made the mistake.
*  It was my fault of shutting the hatch on it.
*  I'd like to reopen that hatch,
*  which is when there's two parents,
*  maybe they're under the same roof, maybe they're not.
*  Or let's just say two caretakers.
*  So kids are pretty darn good at figuring out
*  who to go to for what and how to balance out
*  negative experiences by seeking out
*  the positive reinforcement of the other,
*  sometimes even pitting parents and caretakers
*  against one another.
*  I mean, it makes children sound diabolical,
*  but adults do it too.
*  It's called gossip.
*  What can co-parents, co-caretakers do
*  to try and align strategies or if necessary,
*  to offset some bad stuff that the other parent
*  might be doing?
*  So in today's landscape, where it's about 50%
*  of marriages end in divorce, at least in the US,
*  you also have the situation where then
*  there are new significant others come in
*  and now you've extended the landscape to sometimes
*  five or six different parents.
*  My biological family is starting to look like the UN.
*  We've got so many countries and religions
*  and this thing, it's kind of nice on the one hand,
*  but lots of divergence of opinion and emotional stance
*  and background.
*  How in the world do we wrap our efforts around this?
*  Yeah.
*  So one of the most common questions I get
*  from a parent at Good Inside is like,
*  can you convince my partner why the way they do things
*  is wrong and do things more like Good Inside?
*  And so essentially I always say like,
*  yeah, I'm not, for a million reasons,
*  I'm not too interested in taking that phone call.
*  You know, but.
*  Yeah, I don't get involved in couple disputes either.
*  You know, but again, assuming, and you've said this
*  a couple of times, which I love,
*  I'm assuming the way your kind of partner
*  or the co-parent does things is not like really
*  like damaging your child.
*  Obviously that's like really time for an intervention.
*  No hitting, no emotional abuse.
*  Exactly, but you know, even like,
*  I'm not a believer of saying for a timeout, right?
*  Like I don't believe in timeouts and punishments.
*  I don't think they feel good to kids or parents.
*  And I also don't think they're effective.
*  No, so timeouts not effective.
*  I don't think so.
*  Okay.
*  And we probably should have closed the hatch on.
*  I have to imagine that the going word
*  in the profession of psychology and raising kids properly
*  is you never spank them, you never hit them.
*  Yeah, no.
*  Okay, all right, for the record.
*  So maybe we'll get back there,
*  but just to go on the record,
*  and I think you can sense from my style,
*  not punishing or timeouts,
*  like doesn't mean you're permissive at all.
*  There's 0% permissive or even softness, I think, you know,
*  and not, well, there's softness.
*  There's 0% permissive in those moments,
*  but we can get back there.
*  But let's say your partner does do that
*  or the co-parent, right?
*  Like I would be the first to say to someone like,
*  do I think that that's like messing up your kid?
*  I don't, I really don't,
*  especially if, for example, in that situation,
*  let's say I'm divorced and my now ex, you know,
*  I just know that they do timeouts or this,
*  and I've tried to talk to them, but you know,
*  whatever, they're not getting on board with the style.
*  And to me, what happens is like,
*  you have a kid, they come back to you,
*  and they're like, you know,
*  Papa gave me a timeout and we don't do that in my house.
*  And my first thing is I call my ex.
*  That's usually what I do, or the school did this,
*  and I called the school, I called the ex,
*  and I'm like, why did you do that?
*  We don't do that.
*  What I think is really important,
*  and I actually find it very like relieving as a parent,
*  like what's actually most important
*  is helping my kid understand their experience.
*  Like we center the other person
*  and what they're doing wrong, wrong,
*  instead of centering our kid.
*  We might need to call a parent, the other parent,
*  and say like, hey, it would be really great
*  to get on the same page.
*  Could we do this course together?
*  That would just be great.
*  You don't have to agree with anything.
*  I think that would be great.
*  But in that moment, what my kid needs actually
*  is more like, wait, that's kind of hard, confusing.
*  So like in our house, when you do something
*  like you scream, I hate you, you know,
*  I intervene in one way,
*  and when you go to your dad's house,
*  he intervenes in a very different way.
*  That's a lot of like,
*  that's a lot of switching to make sense of, you know,
*  or maybe my kid says,
*  mom never apologizes to me after she yells,
*  and I would call, you know, or maybe it's my own wife,
*  and I'm like, hey, you know the importance of repair.
*  Haven't you listened to all of this literature?
*  You know, I would like to have some influence on that,
*  but what I feel like my kid needs in the moment
*  is more like, tell me what happened.
*  Oh, oh, she yelled at you, and yeah, look,
*  something I know, like I know mom was,
*  I know she had a really stressful day at work,
*  and look, this isn't your responsibility,
*  but you can just know this,
*  mom has a really hard time apologizing to her,
*  has a really hard time apologizing,
*  and actually when people have a hard time apologizing,
*  they seem cold and like they don't care,
*  they actually usually just feel so ashamed of what they did,
*  and the reason I'm telling you that
*  is not because you have to take care of her,
*  but just so you know this, so wasn't you,
*  and anytime something happens with mom
*  that doesn't feel good,
*  and you feel like you can't resolve it,
*  like you can talk to me,
*  and I'm gonna get out of role play for a sec,
*  but I think you can see,
*  I'm not throwing my wife under the bus, like at all,
*  but I'm centering what my kid needs,
*  what my kid needs going back is they need to process
*  that experience with an adult they feel safe with,
*  rather than be in aloneness,
*  and I often picture like this kid on the couch
*  who tells me a problem at their dad's house or at school,
*  and I like go off to make a call,
*  and I picture them alone being like,
*  oh, now I'm alone, where's,
*  I didn't really want you to go do that,
*  I just wanted you to listen to me.
*  There might then be a step two
*  to kind of get on the same page,
*  or when parents say get on the same page,
*  I think the problem is that we're not looking
*  at the same page, forget getting on the same page,
*  we're not even speaking the same language,
*  people say to me, my partner won't even watch a video
*  with me, that I just wanna even if they disagree,
*  that is the problem, and frankly,
*  that's not a parenting problem,
*  that's also what I'll say to someone,
*  if you say to your partner,
*  look, I've been a member of Good Inside,
*  and it's been really helpful, and it resonates,
*  and you don't have to agree with it,
*  but I would love to watch this four minute video,
*  if your partner says no,
*  that has nothing to do with parenting,
*  that is a core relationship problem,
*  that they just don't care to do something
*  that you say is important to you,
*  that's a marriage problem, that's all, right?
*  And I think it's really important,
*  and we talk about this a lot,
*  if that was someone I'd coach them to say,
*  hey, and you don't have to agree,
*  but if you don't commit to watching a four minute video
*  with me and just talking about it a little bit,
*  and I promise, I'll try not to be judgy or provey,
*  I'll just listen, I don't really think
*  we're talking about parenting,
*  I think you're telling me you don't really respect me enough
*  to do the things I'm asking you to do,
*  and that'll stick with me,
*  like that's the way I'd handle it.
*  Yeah, this is very helpful.
*  I'm curious about these ADHD diagnoses slash kids,
*  because there's a lot of loose hand diagnosis these days.
*  Years ago, I was a camp counselor,
*  took kids backpacking,
*  and I learned an important concept
*  of when working with adolescent and teenage boys,
*  which is be a channel, not a dam.
*  When they're super energetic,
*  they're not sitting still, it's not nap time,
*  there's just no way.
*  So this notion of getting it out,
*  like allowing some place for physical
*  or emotional catharsis that's safe, obviously,
*  and that kids have a lot of energy.
*  I mean, damn it, the adult population seems to be trying
*  to regress themselves to have that energy,
*  so how can we blame them for having so much energy?
*  And of course, there are children who have,
*  and adults with clinically diagnosed ADHD
*  that really struggle,
*  but for the kid that's more energetic,
*  maybe even has a hard time sitting still
*  to the point of discomfort,
*  and when the rest of the world that we can't control
*  is telling them like,
*  hey, your kid needs to be regulated on the subway,
*  on the bus, in the classroom,
*  what are some things that we can do
*  in terms of communication with those kids?
*  And probably some of those kids are listening as well.
*  And to just be a channel, not a dam,
*  to allow their best expression to come forward.
*  Yeah, I mean, I love this idea in general.
*  It's much more effective to tell anyone what they can do
*  rather than telling them what they can't do, right?
*  Across the board with kids,
*  because there's usually a can that is possible.
*  And then you can work with the urge instead of,
*  I don't even know, trying to suppress it
*  or have it not act itself out.
*  It's like our urges and feelings, our forces,
*  they're gonna come out.
*  And so, yes, I think this idea of me and my kid
*  are on the same team here.
*  I think that's so important to start with.
*  And you can definitely,
*  if you have a kid with some intentional struggles,
*  we're on the same team.
*  You can so easily get into me against you,
*  and then you look to shut down everything about them.
*  But yeah, we're on the same team.
*  So let's say it's hard to do homework right now.
*  I see you, okay, let's take an amount of time,
*  and it seems like you have a lot of energy.
*  Let's do some heavy work or let's run outside.
*  Maybe homework always has to start after a period like that.
*  Maybe they need a break.
*  But this idea of, yes, I'm working with my kid
*  as opposed to against my kid
*  is always gonna be more successful.
*  Do you think that some of the new emerging tools,
*  some of which I've talked a lot about,
*  but many, many people have talked a lot about things
*  like meditation, kids doing some long exhale breathing,
*  you know, in addition to the way I grew up,
*  it was like PE time or recess time,
*  you're like running around like crazy.
*  And do you think that these tools
*  are helping kids get some self-regulation,
*  or is whatever self-regulation they're gaining offset
*  by the fact that, you know, there's just so much more input?
*  You know, we hear so much about the challenges
*  of social media for adults, but certainly for kids,
*  you know, bullying, obviously being one
*  of the more salient ones, but also just the fact
*  that when they go home at night and they're in bed,
*  they're potentially still in interactions with their friends.
*  We used to have a phone landline
*  that we'd sometimes call one another on,
*  but I wasn't really much of a phone kid with my friends.
*  So when you were home, you were home.
*  You were separated from all of that.
*  I mean, how bad is it?
*  And what are some things
*  that parents and kids might consider?
*  Yeah, to me, meditation, things like that,
*  like always like icing on the cake,
*  like that's always helpful.
*  And certainly like teaching kids real tools.
*  Like those are like literally something I can do.
*  I've learned this meditation.
*  I have a mantra, something like that, like huge fan, right?
*  You have to be able to like touch it in some way.
*  But to me, I think what's coming up
*  is you bring up this larger point
*  and it actually goes back to where we started.
*  It's like the cost to children
*  of parents not being able to set boundaries
*  has never been higher.
*  And at the same time,
*  it's never been harder for parents to set boundaries.
*  And I think this stuff starts way before social media.
*  Like to me, when I think about the earliest years
*  of a kid's life, like you get so much bang
*  for your buck in life from helping kids just learn
*  to tolerate frustration.
*  And so much of kids early life right now
*  in the world we live in is all about the immediate escape
*  from frustration and not only escape from frustration,
*  but from frustration to gratification.
*  And like an instant, it's like so fast.
*  How did that just happen?
*  Like it didn't used to be like that.
*  There wasn't even an option.
*  Like me and you, like, I don't know, you wanted a movie.
*  Like, I don't know, maybe your parent could drive you
*  to Blockbuster if you had an account.
*  And then like, maybe, I don't know,
*  I remember going and being like, are they gonna have it?
*  Are they gonna have it?
*  And then you see the thing and there's nothing behind it.
*  And you're like, they don't have it.
*  Blockbuster by the way, was a video store.
*  I'm just totally kidding.
*  I'm totally kidding.
*  But some of you out there, like,
*  I sometimes do this to myself, you know?
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  I used to love going and pick out movies at the VHS store.
*  But if you think about that as one tiny thing,
*  it's obviously tiny.
*  And you think about like, I remember that in my childhood.
*  Anything about that tiny moment compared
*  to some parallel in a kid, there's no frustration.
*  The want and the gratification, there's zero space.
*  There is zero space.
*  And also I have to say, our generation of parents,
*  and me too, 100% me too, our tolerance for frustration
*  has gone way down because of the gratification world
*  we live in, which means our tolerance of our kids' tantrums
*  is at an all time low.
*  Because we're like, hey, my life is like pretty easy
*  in a lot of ways.
*  This is like a massive inconvenience.
*  So kids have more gratification than ever.
*  We have lower tolerances for frustration.
*  Everyone does, which means the way we interact with kids
*  over and over and over, plus just the natural things
*  they're exposed to or not, like Netflix versus Blockbuster,
*  just means like their circuitry around expectations
*  and what feels good.
*  Like to me, that's what really scares me.
*  It does.
*  And like figuring out how to tolerate
*  or even insert, like insert frustration into your kid's life
*  as early as possible to me is like,
*  is of critical importance.
*  I could not agree more.
*  And I say that with the understanding
*  that I have also shortened the latency
*  in my reward prediction errors, which is nerd speak
*  for when I want to watch a movie, I go into Netflix
*  and it's near infinite and I can get right then.
*  The internet's a little slow.
*  Then I start barking about how slow internet
*  is worse than no internet.
*  And you start observing yourself and you just go,
*  oh my goodness, like what's going on?
*  I mean, the ability to tolerate different wait times
*  between anticipation and reward is so critical.
*  And that's what getting a degree is about.
*  That's what doing anything challenging is about.
*  I've gone on record saying that too much dopamine
*  without effort exerted in order to get that dopamine
*  is very detrimental.
*  Well, that to me and all the screen time kind of discussion,
*  there's so much screen time and social media
*  and like all the things that screen time do for kids.
*  And again, like my kids watch TV and they're young
*  and they have iPads.
*  Like I'm so not a purist.
*  I'm a pragmatist and whoever's listening to this,
*  no one messed up their kids forever.
*  So we can just, like we were talking about before,
*  we use this information to make slightly different decisions
*  on the margin.
*  That's the best it gets.
*  But I think about this a lot,
*  when our kids are especially young
*  and they're building this circuitry around like,
*  what does it mean to get success?
*  Like what are my expectations there?
*  How much effort do I have to put in?
*  And I think about like a young kid,
*  playing some mindless just dopamine giving game.
*  The circuit they learn is like mindlessness,
*  zero effort, dopamine.
*  And then I think, and I find this really interesting,
*  like how many people say like their kid is six now,
*  having a really hard time learning how to read.
*  And they're gonna have these learning assessments
*  and the learning assessments are coming back,
*  like no dyslexia, right?
*  And I know some of these families,
*  they say this with love is I say,
*  I literally think this is the first time in this kid's life
*  that they kind of have to put like concerted effort
*  without in the moment success.
*  And so yeah, that like, that looks like a lot of things.
*  It can even present like ADHD, right?
*  Because it can present like that, it might be,
*  but it might also just be that these dopamine circuits
*  have developed in a way that's not conducive
*  with something like learning how to read, right?
*  And so when parents ask me now,
*  like I know reading and academic skills,
*  like what can I do when my kids are younger?
*  I got them flashcards, no flashcards.
*  Like, I mean, you can get flashcards, that's fine.
*  It's not like detrimental, but to me it's like,
*  well, what is my kid's relationship with frustration?
*  Because I think about this thing called
*  like the learning space, right?
*  Again, I'm visual, like there's not knowing
*  how to do something and then there's successfully
*  doing something and the space in between is
*  like the learning space, that's what learning is.
*  And learning, the learning space inherently is frustrating.
*  That's like the real thing.
*  That's like the right feeling to be feeling.
*  And when kids have learned to collapse those two things,
*  then like they don't have a lot of space to learn.
*  Versus, I don't know, even like I'm thinking about my kid
*  who wants to like draw a rainbow or sun when they're young.
*  And they're like, that doesn't look like a sun.
*  It would be easy for me to be like,
*  let me just do that for you.
*  And by the way, yes, I give myself permission
*  to do that sometimes.
*  Like sometimes like I can't deal with this.
*  I've got other things to do.
*  But sometimes I think like long and that longterm greedy,
*  like this is gonna be the same circuit
*  for learning how to read.
*  It is, and for learning how to do that project.
*  And what if my only goal, forget them drawing a sun
*  and I've got to tolerate the whining,
*  my only goal was just to lengthen the amount of time
*  they let themselves be in that learning space.
*  That's it.
*  Because I think we know as adults,
*  it's not about getting to success.
*  That comes when it comes.
*  The longer amount of time you let yourself
*  be in that learning space,
*  the more successful you can be with hard things.
*  Because like it just is, right?
*  You just gotta traverse through.
*  And so to me, that's like honestly,
*  one of the things I'm most passionate about teaching parents
*  is like literally like, what do you do during that time then?
*  How do I change what my goal is?
*  If my goal is to stop my kids tantrum,
*  I'm gonna collapse it.
*  But if my goal is just to lengthen that,
*  I might do something very different.
*  Oh, drawing a circle.
*  That's not, you're right.
*  You didn't wanna draw that.
*  Oh, drawing a circle is so hard.
*  And my kids, can you do it for me?
*  Can you do it?
*  Of course sometimes I will, but I might say,
*  I'm not gonna do it, sweetie.
*  I'm not, you know why?
*  Because I know you can do this a little more.
*  I have faith in you.
*  And I think this is so powerful to say to kids,
*  this is so frustrating.
*  And that's the exact way you should be feeling.
*  We don't want our kids to be,
*  that's the right feeling.
*  I'll even draw that learning space visual.
*  This is where you're in the, this is where you are.
*  You're doing an amazing job.
*  And it is actually interesting when kids are young.
*  They actually do adopt that.
*  Someone said to me, I've been doing this stuff for a while,
*  my kid literally says to me,
*  I like to do hard things, mom.
*  They believe it.
*  That's an amazing self-belief to develop it again.
*  That's awesome.
*  So yes, I think this stuff,
*  especially compared to how easy it is
*  to get that gratification,
*  it's just more important than ever to have an offset.
*  Yeah, I'm doing my best to get the word out into the world
*  that the only reason the brain changes at all
*  is if there is these neuromodulators like epinephrine,
*  adrenaline in the body and brain,
*  because that's what signals
*  that the nervous system needs to change.
*  If something can be accomplished,
*  there's no reason for the nervous system to change
*  by definition.
*  There's also, I don't want to spin off into a neuroscience
*  of resilience and willpower lesson here,
*  but there's some amazing literature that shows
*  that there's this area of the brain,
*  the anterior mid-singulate cortex,
*  which is activated when people do things
*  they don't want to do.
*  And it generalizes to other things,
*  but this is not the, I love to work out,
*  so I'm going to work out.
*  This is the, I hate to work out and I do it anyway.
*  And it translates to success in academic endeavors,
*  success in all sorts of environments.
*  And so I think the beauty of it is
*  that this brain structure is highly plastic
*  and can be built up through one thing
*  and that translates to others.
*  So doing hard things, experiencing
*  what I call limbic friction,
*  just as a gateway to learning,
*  just understanding that it always feels hard.
*  That's what learning is.
*  In fact, I can remember in graduate school,
*  even as a young adult, my mid-20s,
*  I was struggling with an analysis
*  and my graduate advisor, she was wonderful this way.
*  And I said, she clearly knew how to do it.
*  And I said, can you explain how to do this?
*  And she goes, no.
*  I was like, just get done.
*  And she's like, no, it's called learning.
*  And I just walked out.
*  She was also a great parent to her children.
*  And I also tried to get adopted by her and that failed.
*  So, you know, I'm-
*  Third time's the charm.
*  Exactly.
*  My poor parents, like they did their best
*  and I'm grateful to them for many things.
*  But I think that including the encouragement
*  to do hard things, do things that suck.
*  That are beneficial for us.
*  So it's a knife edge, right?
*  Now I'm reflecting.
*  It's like, do things that suck.
*  I believe you, it sucks.
*  And then what did my mom used to say?
*  A lot, you know, hate me now, love me later.
*  I loved her then and I love her now.
*  But yeah, there were moments where it was like,
*  I hate that you're making me do this.
*  I don't know about the hate me now, love me later.
*  Old school.
*  But-
*  But I think what she was trying to say is,
*  I have your best interest in mind.
*  Definitely.
*  Definitely, yeah.
*  No, definitely.
*  Can I say one thing just because it's loud in my head?
*  Please, please.
*  One of the things, and this, I think it's easy
*  and I'm hearing myself, we hear this
*  and I think it's easy to listen and be like,
*  oh man, I never thought about it that way.
*  I didn't know that.
*  Or again, we just spiral as a parent so fast.
*  Like I messed up my kid forever.
*  Nobody messed up their kid forever.
*  It doesn't matter how old, it's just not true.
*  And this is where I think we can spiral into like,
*  yeah, what's wrong with me?
*  And I kind of ask parents in this situation
*  to like come with me to a different location,
*  which is kind of like anger.
*  And I have started to feel angry
*  and I think angry, anger like tells us what we need.
*  So I'm like, well, what is that anger telling me?
*  Like it is messed up.
*  The system is stacked against us
*  that when you become a parent,
*  it is literally the hardest, most confusing,
*  most triggering, most important job we have
*  and we are given zero resources, right?
*  Nobody I know would tell a surgeon
*  who never went to med school and was struggling at surgery
*  that they were a bad surgeon.
*  They'd be like, wow, you probably deserve
*  to go to med school and residency, by the way.
*  That's an important job you have.
*  And so I think it's easy to listen to all this
*  and spiral into like, oh no,
*  but I'd ask you to almost like feel a little
*  like protective, helpful anger next to it,
*  which is like, wow, yes, this is an important job I have.
*  This is complicated and maybe there are resources
*  out there that like I deserve.
*  And I think that like, that's the perspective
*  I would ask parents to listen from.
*  Earlier, you described the job of parenting as boundaries,
*  right, imparting boundaries,
*  as well as empathy and validation.
*  I just want to remind people that you're like very basic,
*  but very practical job description for parenting
*  is something that I think we can return to
*  over and over again.
*  It also makes me wonder in thinking about the
*  generalizability of these concepts
*  to other forms of relationship.
*  What about the relationship to self?
*  Right, it's something we don't often talk about.
*  Relationship to self, we want to have boundaries
*  and we also want to be able to empathize
*  and validate ourselves.
*  Yeah.
*  And I think, right, like, I don't know,
*  my friend didn't invite me.
*  I don't know, I found out she had five friends for dinner
*  and I was like, oh, you know, I'm so hurt.
*  I would say to myself, I believe myself,
*  like I'm allowed to feel that way.
*  I think our feelings love when we tell them they make sense.
*  I just think there's something magical about that phrase.
*  It makes sense I'm upset.
*  I mean, my friends were all there and I wasn't.
*  That makes sense.
*  And there's a boundary, because when my feeling tells me,
*  well, I'm about to plan a dinner party for 200 people
*  and invite everyone I know but her,
*  I feel like there's an important,
*  like, you know what feeling?
*  Like, I'm not gonna let you go that far.
*  And the image I always think about is like,
*  I'm the driver of my car and all the different feelings
*  and urges, like, they're passengers
*  and we can't get them out of the car.
*  You just can't, they're in your body,
*  but you don't wanna let them take over the driver's seat.
*  That's really what it is.
*  And as long as they're a passenger,
*  they actually won't cause you that many problems.
*  They'll be annoying.
*  And to me, that's like, hey, I see you.
*  Like, I see you.
*  And I will often say hi to my feelings for that reason,
*  like, high anxiety that woke me up at four in the morning,
*  you know, like, yes, there's a lot of my mind high.
*  And then there's like a boundary,
*  like, you're not, like, you're a part of me
*  and not all of me.
*  So I think that phrase for regulating your own feelings,
*  you're a part of me and not all of me,
*  is the essence of validating and having a boundary.
*  What about our need, I think healthy need,
*  to know whether or not the lesson stuck?
*  So I've observed this before.
*  A kid is catastrophizing about an upcoming event,
*  maybe a concert or a test or a homework thing
*  or a social thing.
*  And like, we're using all our best tools
*  to try and help them.
*  And I believe you, I hear you then.
*  And they go through the experience
*  and they do pretty well, maybe even great.
*  And then we say, like, did you notice?
*  You were so concerned before and you did it.
*  You really did it.
*  Is there something that we can or should do
*  to try and stamp down that recognition?
*  Because one thing that's so beautiful about childhood
*  is the short-term horizon nature of childhood,
*  which kind of like, trying not,
*  I mean, we talk about adults trying to take it
*  one day at a time or even half a day at a time.
*  And kids are navigating on the basis of like,
*  first period class, second period class.
*  I mean, their horizon is often very close in.
*  And I do wonder if they're internalizing
*  these more global lessons on their own
*  or whether or not we should try and help them internalize
*  what they just did.
*  Like, do you get it?
*  You were super concerned.
*  You were like almost dissolving
*  into a puddle of your own tears.
*  And I believe you, that was the appropriate response then.
*  And now you did it.
*  Like, think about that.
*  Is it good that we reinforce those wins?
*  Yeah, I mean, I think that,
*  I think our kids do internalize kind of the patterns, right?
*  But I hear you, there are these moments,
*  it's almost like we want to like encapsulate it for them.
*  Like, hey, that was the thing, right?
*  I think kids pick up on whether our interactions
*  were doing something for them or for us.
*  So if it's from a like,
*  hey, that thing I taught you was really helpful, right?
*  Like, it would just be like if my husband was like,
*  hey, your presentation went well
*  because I told you to do that thing.
*  And I'd be like, stop talking to me, right?
*  But if he said to me, hey, like what was it
*  that led to that?
*  It's probably like, that's helpful to talk out.
*  I'd be much more open.
*  So I love the phrase going back to like just real tools,
*  I'm noticing.
*  I think actually often we want to praise our kids
*  or tell something just saying I'm noticing.
*  Because again, we want to be seen.
*  We don't want to feel controlled.
*  I'm noticing does that.
*  Like, hey, I'm noticing you were so worried
*  about this test.
*  We kind of talked about this way of like talking
*  to your anxiety.
*  And then I'm just noticing you like felt really good
*  about how it went.
*  Like even that, I think,
*  because that's like the biggest thing now
*  in our like crazy fast world we live in
*  is just pausing to notice.
*  That's already like encapsulating.
*  Or saying to your kid,
*  and I think like a question's only a question
*  when you don't know the answer, right?
*  Like sometimes we ask questions,
*  they have question marks,
*  but it's like a statement or criticism.
*  So if we say to our kid,
*  that thing I taught you was really helpful, right?
*  Do you think that was helpful?
*  That's not really a question.
*  We already have an answer.
*  But if I say, hey,
*  like I just thought it would be good for us
*  to talk through for a second.
*  Like what was it you think that like led you
*  to really feel good that day in the test?
*  Then like if I really don't know what my kid could say,
*  I think they'll receive it.
*  And then they might say like,
*  oh, that thing we talked about.
*  Like that's so great to know.
*  I'm even thinking about Spanish coming up.
*  Like I wonder, do you think that would,
*  I think I wonder is also a great phrase for parents,
*  just wondering, I wonder if that would be helpful there.
*  Again, they just like lower defensiveness
*  because there's maybe there's like movement with wondering,
*  it doesn't feel controlling.
*  So yeah, I think there is like,
*  those are nice moments if it comes from a place
*  of like connection, not from control.
*  That makes sense.
*  We had a guest on this podcast,
*  Lisa Feldman Barrett, who's a world expert in emotions.
*  And she explained that in cultures
*  where there's more nuanced language for different emotions,
*  rather than the, what I call the emojification of emotions,
*  there's better emotion tolerance.
*  So understanding that it's not just sad, happy, depressed,
*  thrilled, but there's a lot of nuance.
*  It's very context dependent, can be very useful.
*  Do you think there's something to be gained
*  from letting kids explore the range of emotions,
*  not just, how do you feel good or bad?
*  I mean, most adults need to learn
*  that good or bad are valuations.
*  That's not actually an emotion.
*  It's not actually an expression of how you feel,
*  but that's what we do over shorthand.
*  Do you think that, let's just say in the United States,
*  but elsewhere perhaps as well,
*  that there's some value to teaching kids
*  to pay attention, like what is going on inside?
*  Yeah.
*  Like, what is this feeling of what I call anxiety?
*  Is it excitement and anxiety,
*  like being able to better pinpoint what one is coping with,
*  but also the positive aspects of emotion?
*  Yes.
*  I mean, as many, I, even the clinical psychologists,
*  the question, how do you feel?
*  I always find like a very, like a lot of pressure.
*  I don't know.
*  Like, I think that's, I tend not to ask my kid that,
*  but I tend also never to have asked like patients that.
*  Like, so, you know, I think what we're getting at is we want,
*  and I think this relates to resilience.
*  Like resilience is our ability in my mind
*  to tolerate the widest range of emotions as possible.
*  Cause like, as humans, we're gonna feel that whole range.
*  So the more of them you've learned to tolerate,
*  like the better off you'll be.
*  And so that's what I want for my kids.
*  I don't know if that has to explicitly come from naming,
*  although I think that point is definitely true.
*  The more things we can name,
*  the more things we can understand.
*  To me, just showing up for your kid
*  in a way that's like with believing, maybe with boundaries,
*  is probably the best way to help your kid
*  tolerate the widest range of emotions.
*  Cause they learn that every emotion,
*  like can be held in connection with someone else, right?
*  Versus held in aloneness and is bad.
*  So I guess that's why I think through it.
*  Maybe we could talk about adolescents and teenagers,
*  specifically.
*  Teenagers are wild.
*  I always say that the single most traumatic aging event
*  and the most rapid rate of aging
*  that we ever experience is puberty.
*  I mean, just fundamentally,
*  brain circuits that were for one thing
*  or that were dormant, change and come alive
*  in ways that the world forever will look different to us,
*  feel different to us, and our self-perception changes,
*  period.
*  It's something that biologists still understand
*  at the level of hormones and hypothalamic circuitry,
*  but that has really not been matched
*  to a psychological understanding and vice versa.
*  So like nothing is quite like the music you listen to
*  when you're a teenager.
*  It like brings you back.
*  The memories you form, positive and negative,
*  stamp down, boom, now and forever.
*  The emotional salience can change,
*  but those are wild years.
*  What are some of the more critical needs
*  of late adolescents and teens that are actionable?
*  Yeah.
*  And yeah, I mean, my teen years were crazy,
*  but even if they're less crazy, they're always crazy.
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  And one of the reasons I think, at least in America,
*  that adolescence has seen such a huge shift,
*  like my kid is out of control, they're always out,
*  they're like always rejecting me,
*  I actually don't think is unrelated
*  to the behavioral control approaches
*  that are inherent in American parenting,
*  because like you referred to, your kid becomes 14,
*  and they kind of realize like, wait,
*  I'm bigger than one of my parents.
*  Like I literally don't care about
*  their sticker charts anymore.
*  And we might've missed 14 years of building a relationship.
*  And so what that kid's adolescence is going to look like
*  is markedly different than if for those past 14 years,
*  you weren't giving into everything, no,
*  but you were leading in a sturdier, more connected way.
*  So I really think this whole idea
*  that American adolescents like reject everything,
*  I actually think not all of it,
*  a part of it is completely developmentally normal,
*  but a big part of it relates to this tradition
*  of behavioral control that kids cannot reject
*  until they're at the age that they kind of could survive
*  on their own, which is adolescence.
*  So I think that's really important.
*  The things I would tell parents to really keep in mind
*  that are critical, number one is related to that,
*  like a teen's job is to separate
*  and to start to form their own identity.
*  And I think there's a couple things
*  about that parents need to know.
*  Number one, like I don't think we prepare parents enough
*  for the true sense of loss they feel
*  when their kids are adolescents, because that's very real.
*  Like you've just spent all these years
*  and like you've driven them to every soccer
*  and they kind of talk to you in the backseat
*  and maybe you have family movie nights
*  and then all of a sudden they don't want any of that.
*  And it's just so important for parents to know
*  like I'm going to feel sad, I'm going to feel lost.
*  And if we don't know to expect it,
*  we often kind of infuse that
*  into a lot of anger toward our kid.
*  And so I just think that's normal
*  and we should talk about that more.
*  Parents of adolescents need to be talking
*  about that with each other.
*  Of course you miss that, that's totally normal.
*  Number two, related to that separation.
*  If you think about identity formation,
*  like here's a kid and us and we're kind of close
*  and they now are at the stage where developmentally
*  their job at that stage is to figure out who they are.
*  They have to over correct.
*  Like you have to kind of over correct
*  in the amount of space you take
*  because it's really the only way you can figure out
*  like wait, maybe I do want to take parts of that,
*  that part's okay.
*  And so I think that's like a powerful image to think about.
*  Like they are moving far away.
*  That distance they take from you is not their final point.
*  They will move closer.
*  Now going back to loss, not as close as they used to be.
*  And that is different, but that's not,
*  this is their way of trying to figure out who they are.
*  Then the last thing I'd say that kind of relates
*  to that image is like even as they move away,
*  I think parents massively underestimate
*  how much they still need us there
*  making efforts to connect.
*  And I always think like the difference
*  in like an explorer and a nomad is whether
*  or not you have a home base.
*  And like if our teens feel like nomads,
*  it's not a good situation.
*  They're explorers, they try a million different things,
*  but like they really do need us.
*  They need to know that they have a home.
*  And I'll never forget my private practice.
*  I used to work with teens, not the long ago,
*  just the teens, sometimes the parents too.
*  And this teen came to me and this was extreme.
*  She'd been really in a bad place with her parents,
*  like intense, intense conflict.
*  And they got in this huge fight
*  and she was really, really upset.
*  She was describing this to me.
*  She's like, and then I was like, get out of my room.
*  Get out, I hate you, get out.
*  And I was just like sitting there listening
*  and then she like pushed me out and I slammed the door.
*  And then just a couple minutes later, open the door.
*  My heart's racing.
*  Can you believe they weren't there?
*  Can you believe they weren't there?
*  And to me, it was just this like,
*  and again, it's not about being a punching bag,
*  but I like under, like her seeming anger
*  and her like intense pain were so close together
*  in her own story, it's just over and over the same thing.
*  Like they're gonna reject you.
*  They're gonna say, get out of my room.
*  And yes, it sucks that they want you
*  to slip a note under their door.
*  After you've taken a couple of minutes,
*  it says, that was really tough.
*  Or like, wow, that got out of control.
*  You're a good kid and I love you.
*  And I wanna just tell parents of teens,
*  you're gonna do that.
*  There's gonna be a pause
*  and then you will hear them rip up the note.
*  You will.
*  And like, I swear to any parent that that still resonated
*  and your kid is again trying to figure out,
*  how do I stay close with my parents
*  and I'm figuring out my own who I am?
*  So like they rip up the note
*  because like they almost like have to do it
*  to like take in how much they're still desperate
*  for those bids for connection.
*  Sounds a lot like the dynamics of adult relationships.
*  Although hopefully with a little bit
*  less dramatic accentuation.
*  But even if it does, I mean, it's like these circuits
*  that are laid down in childhood, early childhood,
*  they persist, right?
*  I mean, I think if anything has become clear to me
*  in understanding brain development and brain function,
*  it's that we don't discard circuitry for attachment
*  and go, oh, that was for mom and this one was for dad
*  and that was for the dog.
*  And then the romantic relationship is different.
*  We repurpose the circuits.
*  Hence all the beautiful work on childhood attachment
*  that's now being translated to adult attachment.
*  I mean, I realize there's nuance to it,
*  but I was reflecting a bit on this, again,
*  incredibly potent phrase or mention of explorers
*  versus nomads of having a home base
*  and thinking about these psychology experiments
*  where children are observed
*  in the presence of their caretakers.
*  Sometimes the strange situation task
*  where people are separate, kids are separated
*  from their moms and the mom and child, typically mom.
*  Nowadays, it's also been done with other caretakers
*  and dads reunite.
*  But one doesn't even have to know about those experiments.
*  All you have to do is go to a park or be out in public
*  and see a little toddler venturing away from parent.
*  And then what do they do every once in a while?
*  They look back.
*  They're just trying to check to make sure they're there.
*  Even the kids that aren't taking off on the tricycle
*  like crazy will eventually stop and look back.
*  It's like this fundamental circuit.
*  We're looking back and how far they feel they can go
*  is in direct relationship to presumably the number of times
*  that they recharged and were able to see that verification
*  that the parent was still there.
*  I think this notion of explorers versus nomads
*  and being an explorer, obviously being a good thing,
*  a healthy thing within reason,
*  and nomads just feeling adrift, untethered.
*  One of the scariest words, at least to me,
*  in the English language.
*  So the note under the door,
*  it included the words, I love you.
*  I don't want to get too detailed here,
*  but those words sometimes are never spoken in a home,
*  sadly.
*  Sometimes are spoken so often
*  and under so many circumstances that one wonders,
*  do they lose their potency?
*  But I noticed that in that note, it finished, I love you.
*  It's sort of like stating at the end of the day,
*  no matter what you say, probably even what you do.
*  I mean, I've been in the presence of parents of kids
*  that were criminals that did horrible things.
*  They still love their kids.
*  So reminding kids that under any and all circumstances.
*  Yeah, and again, and I think what's so critical
*  because our brain collapses is that doesn't mean
*  you think their behavior is okay.
*  And I get the fear.
*  I would never want to send my kid the message
*  that it's okay to quote, do certain things.
*  It's okay to just scream at your parents.
*  Of course it's not okay.
*  It's just, I think we miss that happened.
*  That happened already.
*  If I dropped my phone and it broke
*  and I was trying to understand why it broke,
*  trying to understand that doesn't mean it's okay
*  that I dropped it.
*  It just dropped.
*  It already happened, now what?
*  And yeah, our kids need to know,
*  they need to know that they're loved.
*  Again, there's kind of like in that message,
*  I think, I still see you're a good kid under that moment.
*  And I actually think it's a powerful strategy
*  for every parent to kind of conjure up a good kid image.
*  Like, what is it?
*  Was that that last time we were playing this game
*  and it was just so fun?
*  Or is it a memory of my kid when they were three?
*  And I don't know, they did this really cute thing.
*  And it kind of really crystallizes that.
*  And even under this bad behavior,
*  that kid's still there.
*  And the kids who behave the worst are in the deepest pain.
*  I mean, the adults too.
*  And that's not to say it's okay.
*  But again, we're talking about relationships
*  we want to be in.
*  Like if you're in a relationship with your teen,
*  it's not one you're like, this is toxic.
*  Like, this is my kid,
*  I'm gonna be in a relationship with them.
*  So, you know, remembering that they're in pain.
*  Teens are in a lot of pain.
*  They're exploring a new world.
*  Frankly, right now, like teens have world,
*  we don't understand it.
*  That's so helpful for parents to approach your teen
*  just as a tangible tool and say,
*  there's so many things in your world
*  that I don't understand.
*  And frankly, probably I might criticize or judge.
*  Like, can you take out your phone?
*  This, you know, whatever it is,
*  this app you're on, this video game,
*  like, can we just even time box this five minutes?
*  Like, I just want to end this conversation
*  saying I understand it better.
*  Like, I promise you that's probably gonna do more
*  for your relationship with your kid than anything else.
*  Because yes, they do, and they might reject you.
*  And if you do, again, don't take the bait.
*  But ask again next week.
*  Like, again, they do, they need us to return.
*  Yeah, one thing's for sure.
*  None of us, except those that are teens,
*  know what it's like to be a teenager in 2024.
*  Just like they didn't know what it was like
*  to be a teenager for me in the late 80s, early 90s.
*  How could they?
*  What are your thoughts on like family meetings?
*  Like once a week, we sit down, we check in.
*  You know, I hear that people do this.
*  Many participated in these before.
*  Do you feel like those can be useful
*  or is it more window dressing?
*  I mean, I guess it depends what's happening in there.
*  I mean, the idea of like, hey,
*  there's a lot going on in our life.
*  And we have a ritual of coming together
*  and talking things through, working through problems.
*  Like if that's what it is, that's a beautiful thing.
*  Like I hear that, my first thought is I should do that.
*  You know?
*  But you're right, like life gets messy.
*  So, but if it's done in a way where it feels we end
*  and everyone feels a little bit more understood
*  and a little bit more purpose
*  and, you know, making things move forward
*  in a positive direction, that's amazing.
*  I think family meetings, it's funny,
*  the way I think about them often, which is just different,
*  is it's actually a great strategy,
*  especially when your kids are older
*  and there's like somewhat of an ongoing conflict.
*  So maybe there's like an ongoing conflict
*  about how much video game time or, you know, how much,
*  you know, how late they can stay out.
*  And to say to a kid, and again, this just comes from, again,
*  so important for teens.
*  We have to approach our kid like we're on the same team.
*  I always say, me and my kid against a problem,
*  not me against my kid where they are the problem.
*  Like, and so to say, hey, you've been late, you know,
*  or we have to figure out your curfew.
*  And like, look, you're a smart kid, you're a good kid.
*  My number one job is to keep you safe, but you're old now.
*  And if I just tell you a time,
*  it's the same thing that happened last year,
*  we're getting fights all year, why don't we sit down
*  and we'll do what I do in my office.
*  There's two people, they each have ideas.
*  I'm gonna bring a pad of paper
*  and that's actually super important.
*  And I'm gonna write down all of your ideas and my ideas.
*  And then we're just gonna kind of go through
*  and cross out the ones that feel completely unreasonable.
*  And I have a feeling when we do that,
*  we're gonna come to a good place.
*  So again, you can see there's that like hope I'm giving.
*  Like I hold the positive outcome, same team,
*  I'm giving my kid credit in advance.
*  There's actually like really,
*  it's usually the opposite of what teens feel,
*  which is just my parents don't even listen to me or care
*  and think they have all the answers.
*  I've heard this notion of, you know,
*  couple parents come first and kids come second.
*  And some people are probably like, what?
*  You know, well, clearly never parented.
*  Ah, well, no, actually it's an interesting idea,
*  perhaps not correct or incorrect,
*  but maybe dynamic across time where the real question is,
*  if kids know that they are running the family
*  in terms of what they do or their inability
*  to not be attended to, et cetera,
*  is driving the whole relationship that the parents are in
*  versus, you know, recognizing,
*  and here I'm matching two parent home,
*  but we could talk about divorced
*  or people with significant others or single parent homes.
*  And all of those,
*  you kind of wonder like,
*  are kids really paying attention to how much
*  they are being prioritized to the point where
*  if they observe their parents tending to their own needs,
*  that they feel deprivation or does it make them feel safer?
*  Like, hey, mom and or dad are taking care of themselves
*  and can show up better.
*  Yes, I think that is critically important.
*  And it kind of goes again to boundaries, like of a parent.
*  Like my relationship with my kid is so important
*  and I'm not gonna let that take over me.
*  Like that is not all of me.
*  I am not only a caregiver to my kid.
*  Like I would stand by that all day long.
*  Like, is that an important part of me?
*  And it's still a part of me.
*  And I think this is really important to own as a parent.
*  Because again, we tend to get,
*  like we get apologists for it
*  or we look for our kids permission.
*  We'll say, look, I need to go out with dad without you.
*  Okay, like we have a relationship too.
*  Like, and we, again, there's that job confusion
*  and my kid feels that.
*  And again, it's that kind of giving them too much power.
*  I've said this to my kids a lot.
*  So we'll say, why do you go out with dad without me?
*  I'll say, it's a great question.
*  You know, first of all,
*  dad and I were married before we had kids.
*  Our relationship is really important to us.
*  And we love being with you.
*  And being with you is different
*  than just being the two of us.
*  And that really, really matters to us.
*  And so you don't have to be happy about it.
*  You can, you, and let's say I have a babysitter
*  I know they're safe with.
*  You can cry when I leave and the babysitter will hold you.
*  And we're gonna go out to dinner
*  and we're gonna come back and, you know,
*  I'll see you in the morning.
*  Yeah, I think that is so important.
*  I actually think this is another topic.
*  Like this topic of like rage in parenthood
*  is like a big topic.
*  Like the way, why do I get to these moments of rage
*  so often that my screaming is not just screaming at my kids.
*  It's really rageful.
*  And I think the parents often
*  who are the most vulnerable to that
*  are the ones where they're not meeting
*  like any of their non-caregiving needs.
*  Which makes sense that a part of them is like screaming out.
*  Like, what about me?
*  I used to go to dance class.
*  I used to see friends.
*  I used to go out with my partner
*  and talk about things other than, you know, our kids.
*  And so again, if I think a kids need a sturdy leader, right?
*  More than anything else.
*  And sturdiness is not allowing yourself
*  to be taken over by any one thing,
*  including your relationship with your kid.
*  Is it truly better for there to be two sturdy leaders
*  than one sturdy leader?
*  I realize this is a controversial question.
*  Yeah, I mean, I know, and I know there's research
*  to back this up that like having one kind of sturdy leader
*  in your life is massively protective.
*  I really believe that.
*  And so when parents will say, my partner isn't like,
*  we have research, this is true.
*  Is two better than one?
*  I don't know the research.
*  Probably, I don't know, you know?
*  But what I think is important in there too
*  is what's not great for kids
*  is having like all the caregivers
*  be some like perfectly attuned caregiver, right?
*  Like that actually does not set up your kid for life
*  at all, right?
*  Because I don't know anyone who thinks
*  the partner I'm gonna be with one day
*  is gonna be perfectly attuned to all my needs.
*  Let me go find that person.
*  So, you know, you have one sturdy leader, you have two,
*  but like being sturdy, part of that is you're gonna rupture.
*  You're gonna rupture, you're gonna mess up,
*  you're gonna hopefully repair, you know, after.
*  But sturdiness, I just wanna make clear,
*  is so not the same as like perfection.
*  Perfection is creepy, it's not a thing.
*  No one needs that.
*  I love that.
*  It's the first time I've laughed out loud on this podcast
*  about a statement like that.
*  Yeah, the notion of perfection is kind of creepy.
*  But sturdiness is anything but creepy.
*  It's just such a beautiful word for all the right reasons.
*  What about behavioral examples in parents?
*  So for instance, if children observe parents
*  being affectionate to one another in appropriate ways,
*  right, you know, attending to one another
*  in boundary but empathically attuned ways.
*  Do you think that projects forward into their notion
*  of what adult relationships are like and should be like?
*  Conversely, if parents are yelling at one another,
*  do you think that projects forward into
*  it's okay to yell in adult relationships?
*  Yeah, I mean, I think kids are expert noticeers.
*  They notice everything, right?
*  And that's part of how they've learned to survive
*  as such helpless humans.
*  So they definitely notice, they definitely act like sponges.
*  So yes, if you're kind of privileged enough in that way
*  to grow up in a home or you have parents who in general
*  are fairly affectionate, they take responsibility
*  for their stuff, they communicate in an healthy way,
*  I think that is like a true privilege
*  you go into adulthood with, yes.
*  The other extreme, right, you grow up with parents
*  who, you know, they yell or they can even yell
*  in scary voices, again, what I think is really important
*  is the witnessing of that isn't going to be as impactful
*  to a kid as the witnessing of it and nobody naming it
*  and talking to them about it.
*  So this is why so often like kids will be
*  in difficult stages, intense tantrums, major issues
*  at school and someone's like, what do I do?
*  Like, what do I do with this?
*  Well, I gave you all the strategies in the world
*  but if that is just your kid's way of kind of manifesting
*  all of their struggles with this like huge marital conflict
*  that's happening, it's not gonna work.
*  So it's all part of the same system.
*  And so saying to your kid after you fight with your partner,
*  hey, I think you heard daddy and I screaming
*  and I'm sure that felt scary because it does feel scary
*  because they know you're their base.
*  So if their base is of a house, it's like, you know,
*  it feels like an earthquake, it feels scary.
*  And you know, another line I like is like,
*  you were right to notice that we were using loud voices.
*  Again, I think that's massively confidence, you know,
*  building maybe what was that like for you?
*  Or if you have a little kid, just that's enough, you know
*  and they might look at you and say like,
*  can I have my snack now?
*  But it's still really sunk in.
*  So if there is a lot of conflict again,
*  I think it's really important we talk about that
*  with our kids and don't leave them alone.
*  What about teens that are really wayward?
*  And this could be behavioral outbursts.
*  There's also the whole underside of this thing
*  where it's also about withdrawal.
*  Like the kids are withdrawn.
*  I mean, we were talking about outbursts and yelling.
*  There's also the example in parents
*  or the instances in kids that they're just like
*  really withdrawn.
*  They're just like disengaged.
*  Depressed. Depressed.
*  Maybe even dissociative, who knows, but not good.
*  And this can show up on one end as violence,
*  on the other end as isolation.
*  It can show up as eating disorders.
*  It can show up as all sorts of things.
*  Intervention before age 18 is quote unquote easier
*  in the sense that one has legal control.
*  But oftentimes it's hard for parents to know
*  how bad is this?
*  And I did an entire episode about cannabis
*  and I spoke to some of the medical benefits of cannabis
*  for adults who are non-addicts,
*  but I also talked a lot about some of the risks.
*  But let's take an example that I think is pretty common.
*  Like kids 15, 16 starts smoking some THC
*  with their friends and you go,
*  okay, well, everyone does that.
*  Quote unquote, not as bad as alcohol,
*  which I think is a lame argument.
*  This is lame.
*  Doesn't make any sense.
*  You're getting hit by a,
*  cars and bads are getting hit by a train, but okay.
*  But the point is, most all parents, like, okay,
*  clearly they're self-medicating.
*  They think they can't stop them, but you can stop them.
*  At what point do you then take,
*  you put them into a residential treatment program
*  if you could even afford that?
*  I mean, it's really tough for people to know
*  how much to intervene in what is clearly not good behavior
*  and it sometimes can be bad behavior.
*  And yet the kids are using it to self-medicate
*  and there's a peer system that sometimes reinforces that.
*  I mean, this is a huge landscape.
*  Maybe we have you back to talk just about this,
*  but maybe we can presage that discussion by,
*  like, what do you tell people in your practice?
*  Like, get in there now, pull the emergency cord
*  and get this handled, or do you say,
*  listen, you just gotta work with the system?
*  I mean, it's a tough problem I'm throwing at you.
*  Yeah, I think the first thing is, like,
*  how do I, as a parent, like, kind of even assess?
*  It's like, is this normal?
*  Is it not normal?
*  Is it a problem?
*  Is it not?
*  So I think there's a couple, like,
*  things we could think about there.
*  Number one, just seeing, like, impact on overall functioning
*  is always, like, one barometer, right?
*  So, okay, can my child perform the kind of tasks
*  of their developmental stage?
*  Okay, so this is not the only thing,
*  but, like, are they still going to school?
*  Wow, I notice since they're smoking a lot of weeds,
*  their grades went from Bs to Ds.
*  Like, okay, they don't care about school anymore.
*  They used to actually go out with friends.
*  Now, unless they're with this one crew
*  where they smoke in the park, like,
*  they're not even seeing these kids
*  they used to be friends with.
*  They don't wanna go to family functions anymore.
*  They used to play soccer.
*  Like, if I'm answering this, I'd be like,
*  wow, I'm not really talking just about a marijuana problem.
*  I'm talking about my kid not engaging
*  in kind of, like, the developmental tasks.
*  That, I would say, is just, like,
*  it's time to seek additional support, right?
*  Another sign is just kind of how limited
*  their world has become because of this, right?
*  So, again, is this kind of taken over everything they do?
*  My kid is depressed, let's say, or, you know,
*  and all of a sudden, their world has gotten
*  really, really small, and it's not just that
*  that's the way they've always lived.
*  Like, there's a big change.
*  The amount of conflict in the home.
*  Again, like, is there conflict when you have teens?
*  Of course there is, but, like, wow,
*  like, is it really hard to talk to my teen
*  for more than four minutes?
*  Walking on eggshells, to me, is also a sign
*  that we need additional help.
*  Am I scared to intervene in a way
*  that would actually be in line with my values?
*  That's not a good sign, right?
*  Then the other thing I just wanna make sure everyone knows
*  is, I mean, like, seeking additional help
*  is a sign of every single thing that's right with the family.
*  And I think we think it's a sign of something that's wrong.
*  And it's, like, also a sign of what's right to your,
*  in terms of messaging that to your kid.
*  Again, I think about a kid who I used to see in my practice,
*  she was probably 16 when she came to me,
*  she was cutting, serious, right, a lot, right?
*  And I remember saying, just intake,
*  hey, how long have you been doing this?
*  She was, two years.
*  Oh, like, did you see another therapist before you saw me?
*  She was like, no.
*  She was, like, very, like, kind of, you know,
*  kind of quippy and quick, and I was just like,
*  why?
*  And she's like, well, I told my parents
*  that if they took me to a therapist,
*  I would go and I would just waste all their money.
*  I'd be quiet.
*  And then when they left me there, I would just leave,
*  and who's gonna stop a 14-year-old from walking away?
*  And they might as well save their money
*  because they can't meet me, okay?
*  And again, I just kind of sensed to stay quiet.
*  And she seriously, one of the next things she said is,
*  can you believe they let me make that decision?
*  Literally said that.
*  Wow, validates everything you said up until now.
*  Everything, and it is.
*  This is where I feel like I get my best ideas.
*  That's right, a 14-year-old can convince her parent
*  that she won't go to therapy when she's cutting.
*  That is not okay.
*  And again, then we go to, okay, so I'm gonna say to my kid,
*  you are going.
*  I'm like, no, there's so much between that.
*  We're in these binary states.
*  Your kid's feelings about therapy
*  cannot dictate your boundary, right?
*  But we can't just then come down harshly.
*  And so I coach parents in this all the time.
*  What do you say to a kid?
*  I love you.
*  Hear me, I love you.
*  We're in a tough stage.
*  I see this problem.
*  And I do think even when our kids get older,
*  we can say this.
*  My number one job is to keep you safe.
*  It is not to keep you happy with me.
*  And I actually love you so much
*  that I'm willing to do things
*  that make you unhappy with me.
*  That is actually how much I care about you.
*  And so I am gonna be driving you.
*  And if you wanna curse at me the whole time,
*  I will sit in that waiting room.
*  And you know what I'm gonna do the next week?
*  I'm gonna tell you I love you.
*  I'm gonna do the same thing.
*  And I think adults hearing that on some level,
*  there's some internal truth.
*  I'm like, I probably needed that.
*  That feels oddly good.
*  Because you know I'm not messing around.
*  But there's this way,
*  whereas parents who've said,
*  the way to show my kid I'm not messing around
*  is to be mean to them.
*  There was nothing mean about what I said.
*  I think it was more loving than saying to a kid,
*  okay, let me know when you wanna go.
*  That is not loving.
*  And so I think like our teens sometimes in those moments,
*  they need us to do our job and like be the pilot.
*  Like it is the small amount of time
*  where they're still a passenger.
*  When they're 18, they are the pilot.
*  And so we have this window.
*  There's nothing I wanna probe more into that.
*  I think you captured it beautifully
*  and it gets back to this issue of safety.
*  Like in letting them make their own decision
*  when they're clearly in trouble,
*  like if anything could make a kid feel unsafe,
*  a teen or younger or adult, it's that.
*  Yes, yes.
*  It's like laying the passenger on the plane.
*  Be like, hey, instead of rerouting,
*  how about you just come up here and fly?
*  That's exactly, that's literally what it is.
*  And they're like, I can't believe you believed
*  my little protest now I'm in the cockpit.
*  Like they don't want that.
*  That's why their words, teens words,
*  it's not that we don't believe them.
*  Like as I just said, I'm believing.
*  Their words often are a representation of their fears.
*  All of us in our worst moments.
*  Get out.
*  Like I feel like sometimes like that's their fear
*  or like they're kind of talking to their emotion.
*  They're so like, they're not really talking to you
*  in that moment.
*  They're so dysregulated and like just learning
*  to like not take it so literally and be like,
*  what am I really believing?
*  My kid is in pain, they're cutting.
*  My kid is in pain, they're smoking weed 30 times a day
*  and don't go to class.
*  Like I'm the, like I know that they need help.
*  And again, any parent who can say that like to me
*  is like the strongest parent
*  and that is such a sign of health.
*  I don't think I'd still be alive today
*  if it wasn't for non-parent mentors
*  and just examples in the world.
*  These aren't always people that were like,
*  hey, I'm gonna take you under my wing
*  and be your mentor.
*  Actually, those are rarely the case.
*  But people in my real life or in my, you know, reading
*  or you know, there wasn't YouTube back then,
*  but sometimes now, you know, people I've,
*  I'm a huge fan for instance of these Jungian psychologist,
*  James Hollis, who has these beautiful lectures
*  on making a life.
*  And I'm learning so much, like I consider him a mentor.
*  Sorry, James, you didn't have a choice.
*  You're a mentor.
*  But these people that we can internalize
*  certain healthy aspects that our parents just,
*  just apparently can't seem to arrange for themselves
*  and that we wish they had.
*  But I think that we, as children of all ages,
*  like we want perfect parents.
*  We don't get them.
*  But it seems appropriate to me, I love your thoughts.
*  It seems appropriate to me to have, you know,
*  kind of a foraging for examples of where we can get
*  certain things that we can internalize for ourselves
*  so that we can benefit that maybe our parents
*  just aren't interested in, capable of,
*  or even alive to provide us anymore.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, I mean that like being everything to someone,
*  and like I don't want my kids to ever say that about me.
*  My mom was everything.
*  She fulfilled my every need again.
*  I do find that creepy whenever, I don't know.
*  And like, and just setting them up
*  for so much relationship disappointment.
*  My mom gave some things and you know,
*  now that I also work a lot with my kids,
*  like there is this mom, like when kids have a sleepover
*  at her house, I mean it is the best sleepover experience.
*  I see pictures and I'm like, wow, that was so thoughtful.
*  That was amazing.
*  She's like, she puts it, she's creative.
*  Like, and me and my kids joke, like they're like,
*  yeah, mom, you're like bottom of the list and that stuff.
*  And I am, I am.
*  And like, I know I'm toward the top of the list
*  in other things.
*  I don't want to be toward, first of all,
*  I don't want to hold myself to that standard.
*  That's like a great way to implode.
*  So yeah, being able to say to my kid,
*  oh, you guys want to have a sleepover?
*  You'd rather go to her house?
*  Because that's, okay.
*  Like that's not an indictment of me.
*  And so maybe this is some quote mentor like figure
*  for someone who can like put these details
*  and make people feel really taken care of in that way.
*  That's great.
*  And I think, yes, giving your kid permission
*  and encouragement, again, I think is such a gift
*  to them later on.
*  Like, yeah, our relationship with our kids becomes
*  not only the foundation, their expectations
*  for their relationship with other adults.
*  I also think it's literally what they're attracted to.
*  I think when they're attracted to someone later on,
*  it's just the activation of that like earliest attachment.
*  And so if they can get activated around someone
*  who seems to be pretty attuned and respectful
*  and validating and boundaried,
*  because they also have other things in their life
*  and not everything, like that's a privilege to say,
*  that's what I'm expecting.
*  So I think those other relationships
*  and as a parent to hear your kids say,
*  my coach taught me this thing.
*  And sometimes they say it in a caddy way,
*  so much better than what you said to do at lacrosse.
*  Just to like take a deep breath.
*  And again, this is where you can say like,
*  I'm still a good parent, even outside this moment.
*  I'm so glad you're talking to me about this.
*  I believe you, tell me more about this.
*  Like such a beautiful example for your kid.
*  So being able to validate and embrace the fact
*  that there are other sources of healthy upbringing
*  is not just perhaps is clearly a good thing.
*  Do I have that right?
*  I think that's right.
*  And I think if that's hard for a parent,
*  what I'd say is like,
*  it's a question without an exact answer,
*  but like where did I learn
*  that I'm supposed to be everything to someone?
*  Like, and is that, and I think a lot of women,
*  we learn that in our families of origin to be good girls,
*  which really just means I have no wants and needs of my own.
*  And I just kind of gaze out
*  and see how I can do things for you.
*  And I can be everything for you.
*  And then we have kids,
*  we don't realize we put that onto them.
*  But like you said, those patterns travel with us.
*  And I find it like very relieving to be like,
*  maybe if I don't, wow,
*  it just gave me like a good percentage of energy back.
*  Like I can do like so many other things now, you know?
*  It's very, it's like empowering.
*  I love it.
*  Something that it's an unpleasant topic
*  just by as soon as people hear the word,
*  but it's something that I think comes up on the child side,
*  the teen side and the parenting side
*  and in adult relationships of all kinds,
*  which is the dreaded entitlement.
*  Ooh, dirty word of parenting.
*  Entitlement.
*  Maybe we could put some definition on entitlement
*  and talk about when it's bad, is it always bad?
*  When it's neutral and when it's, I don't know,
*  is it ever good?
*  I don't know, entitlement doesn't sound
*  like it's ever good, but.
*  Yeah.
*  There is a healthy entitlement, right?
*  And I think that is kind of the entitlement to like,
*  I'm allowed to want things and I'm only allowed to
*  at moments in my life even act on that
*  to turn that want into a fulfillment of my want.
*  I think that actually goes back to what we were just saying,
*  like versus how can I please you?
*  Like maybe I wanna do something.
*  So I think that healthy entitlement, that's a good thing.
*  But when I think that when I hear parents say like,
*  please, I just don't want an entitled kid,
*  they're not talking about that, right?
*  And they're talking about, and to me,
*  the story from my practice is just the key thing
*  that makes us parents cringe was this family
*  I've seen in New York City and they were,
*  they were very wealthy and they had the 16 year old son
*  and they're flying back from Hawaii or to Hawaii
*  and they were just getting ready to board
*  and first class was boarding and the sun goes up
*  and they're like, oh, so we were not like in first class,
*  we have to wait.
*  He had basically a full tantrum in the airport,
*  like every parent's first nightmare, literally.
*  And they came to me after, it's being like,
*  how did we like, how did we get here, right?
*  Now this is a family in general, it's true,
*  they flew first class, they had private play
*  and said a lot of money, but entitlement to me
*  doesn't always have to be about money.
*  I'm gonna give you my definition of entitlement,
*  I think it's very different, but to me,
*  the definition like boundaries is useful
*  because it gives you a pathway of what to do.
*  I think entitlement is the fear of frustration.
*  Beautiful.
*  Because if we go back, okay, that thing didn't start at 16
*  and I started kind of collecting stories and right,
*  this is a kid who, and again, like they had a driver,
*  there's nothing wrong with having a driver,
*  but I'm just thinking about like waiting for a subway,
*  it's frustrating, just missed the subway,
*  we're gonna be late, like no, right?
*  This was a kid who didn't make, instead of seeing an older
*  member, like they make the soccer team, don't worry,
*  we have someone who's gonna take you to the nearby town
*  in New Jersey and get on that soccer team, right?
*  And I think about what this kid started to learn
*  about being frustrated and it was kind of like
*  frustration comes up and what gets layered next to it
*  is someone else bringing you an exit.
*  Frustration, exit from frustration,
*  maybe even exit to success, right?
*  And then I started to think like, well, what would it be
*  like if there were 16 years of kind of,
*  because this doesn't have that pattern and that circuit
*  reinforcing, because what you're really learning as a kid,
*  I'm frustrated and that's very overwhelming for me,
*  but like the adults around me must be scared
*  of my frustration because they won't let me sit in it,
*  they won't let me feel it, they will actually kind of run
*  in circles to not have me feel, so I actually encode
*  my frustration next to fear.
*  Now I'm 16 and I'm expecting first class and I get,
*  lowly coach, it's not that people are like,
*  oh, what a spoiled kid, I feel like this kid was
*  insanely vulnerable in that moment.
*  This kid was like, I'm frustrated and what I expect
*  to happen and what I know to happen isn't here.
*  And so it is explosive, it appears as entitlement
*  on the surface, but it is a deep intolerance
*  and almost fear of frustration, which is in your body.
*  So you're terrified of a feeling that is living
*  in your body and it looks demanding because it kind
*  of is desperate, like you can't let this happen.
*  Wow.
*  Fear of frustration as the definition of entitlement
*  lands like square in the bullseye for me.
*  And yes, I think we all default to the kind
*  of stereotypical example of the ultra wealthy family kid.
*  There was that movie, The Toy in the eighties,
*  it was really dreadful concept, actually, a kid that
*  was just given everything and then wanted a person
*  and was really like, talk about foul, I mean, it's just,
*  just bad at every level and then they tried to
*  create this narrative where then, there's a deeper
*  understanding about humans and stuff that evolves from it.
*  But the starting point was, and I've observed this
*  and certainly not my family, but other families
*  where kids are given everything they want.
*  It never feels like enough.
*  Big surprise, dopamine is a real thing.
*  The circuits recalibrate to a higher threshold.
*  They want more and more and more.
*  It's like that movie, Wall Street, what's your number?
*  More, okay, all right.
*  Nothing wrong with wanting things, but without a ceiling
*  on any of that and without a ceiling on pleasure,
*  bounds on experience, it crushes everybody.
*  That's also what that movie was about.
*  It just crushes people.
*  So to build that into a child's neurology,
*  just seems like the worst possible thing.
*  Because it's not about the world being a place
*  of immense possibility, it's about the world being a place
*  of like snakes and broken glass everywhere,
*  except this narrow knife edge path that you follow
*  that is all about infinite resources.
*  And ease, that's right.
*  And what I think is fear is, because if you're in fear,
*  you're in like a threat state, which is why it,
*  when kids are in that state or adults, it seems like nasty,
*  like, and it's mean when you're, you know,
*  and there's this like narrowing of your eyes, right?
*  So I think that's really, you know, what's happening.
*  And it's not always tied to money, but the truth is,
*  and like money can easily buy a kid's way out of frustration.
*  And by the way, it buys the parent out of having
*  to tolerate their frustration while the kid is frustrated.
*  And so it's tricky.
*  I think I've now like, you know, talked to a bunch
*  of parents who grew up in a very different way,
*  were very successful.
*  And I get it, they're like, I feel like I've,
*  I've earned, I've literally have earned the right
*  to have certain parts of my life be a lot easier, right?
*  And like, how do I though not, how do I raise a kid
*  who isn't entitled, right?
*  And it is a conundrum, right?
*  I think like, you know, we raise our, raise our kids
*  in a candy store, it's hard to expect them
*  to appreciate candy, right?
*  And so like, how do we, how do we balance that gratitude,
*  the entitlement?
*  And I do think though that idea is like,
*  we just have to, sometimes like other people hearing this
*  would be like, yeah, like my life is frustrating
*  all the time, and some people's are, right?
*  They won't end up with entitlement.
*  But for other families, they almost have to be like,
*  I have to like dose it.
*  I have to make sure that I'm not getting
*  like, I have to like dose it.
*  I have to make sure my kids literally have experiences
*  and I probably have to go through it too,
*  where we are almost like purposefully making sure
*  they get enough of that, you know,
*  so they can build different circuits.
*  Yeah, so much done back there.
*  I think it's clear that some of this
*  is tied to financial means.
*  I think it's a pretty scary thing
*  when someone looks out on the landscape of the world
*  as infinite possibility without any frustration.
*  As we talked about earlier,
*  the ability to lean into hard things as a skill
*  that can extend to other things is so valuable.
*  Do you think that some of the smaller practices
*  that any kid, any parent, any family,
*  regardless of means can lean into, can really help there?
*  Like, you know, some people say grace or a prayer
*  before a meal, others simply express gratitude,
*  but you know, stopping and thinking about, you know,
*  I mean, being breathing, being ambulatory,
*  being any number of good things that allow us agency in life,
*  about to eat food, I mean, those moments,
*  I think are, I know that our nervous system
*  reflects on those.
*  How could they not?
*  And just recognizing that at least something went
*  into the creation of the meal.
*  I think for like the entitlements up and the frustration,
*  like there's all these small moments
*  that we can start to make a difference.
*  And I think it's saying to yourself, just because I can,
*  doesn't mean I will.
*  So like my kid's young and I picked them up from a playdate.
*  And let's say I have a babysitter at home
*  or my husband at home.
*  And I'm like, I have to go to a store and some errands.
*  My kid's like, can you drop me off first?
*  Maybe I'm like, you know what?
*  Like, no, like you're gonna come with me.
*  I'm not gonna say this way, but I'm boring errands
*  because you just have to tolerate that like sometimes
*  you have to do things you don't wanna do.
*  And like, you are not gonna learn that
*  by me telling you that.
*  You're gonna learn that by experiencing that.
*  You know, something with my kids, you know, the other day,
*  we were at an airport and like there were, you know,
*  in the airport, like it kind of winds around like to get,
*  and there was like no one there.
*  So they started to like duck under all the like things.
*  And it just made me think like as a small moment,
*  like entitlement also was like,
*  the rules don't apply to me in some ways.
*  Sounds like, and I just remember you guys
*  when we're in airports.
*  Oh, the lines leading up to security.
*  Yeah, and you can duck and sometimes you like mess them up
*  and it wasn't like forever, but I was like, you guys,
*  like these things, someone put these here for a reason
*  and we're just gonna, it's like,
*  like these things don't have to be so,
*  it's a small amount of frustration,
*  but it's just like, I don't always get to duck the line.
*  Sometimes I have to like walk a little longer.
*  I remember my kid saying, and I'm not immune to this.
*  Like I am in a financial position where I have someone come
*  sometimes help me be my housekeeper, right?
*  And she'll fold the laundry.
*  I remember on a Sunday, my son said to me when he was younger,
*  like, why do we have to fold the laundry?
*  Kind of like, I don't think he said it,
*  but he was kind of like, don't we have someone, you know,
*  who could do that?
*  And I remember being like, this is a moment where I could be
*  we're gonna fold the laundry on Sundays.
*  You know who loves folding laundry?
*  Maybe some people like, I don't,
*  I don't love undoing the dishwasher.
*  It is inherently not that enjoyable,
*  but like, and so frustrating.
*  It's just like not great.
*  And like, I know I need to make my kids do that.
*  Like they just have to go through that mundane thing.
*  And so I think there's all of these moments,
*  taking your kid with you on errands, you know,
*  doing the laundry, right?
*  Before you say to your kid,
*  let's go to try out on another soccer team.
*  Just like, oh, you didn't make the team.
*  Maybe, maybe let it go two days.
*  That's at least two more days
*  of feeling upset and frustrated, right?
*  They don't have to be these big grand things,
*  but all of those little moments can add up
*  in a really positive way.
*  What's your stance on household chores
*  and should kids be paid for household chores?
*  Yes, I have a whole guide to chores and allowance.
*  And I actually, you know,
*  I think there's a lot of thought like,
*  should they be separate?
*  I don't know, I think it could be done either way.
*  But to me, the question for a parent is like,
*  what is the point for me?
*  Like, what is my goal for chores?
*  What is my goal for allowance, right?
*  And I think that has to then structure how we do it.
*  So my guess is for chores, part of it is,
*  I want my kid to, number one,
*  maybe like help around the house.
*  I want them to have that purpose.
*  Also, like I know for me for chores,
*  like sometimes your life involves doing boring things.
*  That is just true.
*  And like, I want my kids to know that,
*  which means they have to experience it.
*  That's one of the reasons we do chores.
*  So for me, if that's one of the reasons,
*  I'm not gonna pay my kid.
*  Because for me, in my family,
*  what I think my kids need to get out of it,
*  is just like knowing that sometimes you do boring things
*  as part of being a good human.
*  For someone else, that might be totally different.
*  So I think we just ask ourselves as parents,
*  like, what am I trying to accomplish?
*  And then let me structure it around that.
*  Across the course of today's discussion,
*  I've been feeling both immense gratitude and relief
*  for certain quote unquote hardships that I experienced
*  and things that my parents made me do
*  or ways that they were negligent.
*  And I was forced to figure things out.
*  Also, you know, some things where I was like,
*  ah, like wish they had done this.
*  I think everyone listening to this will feel that way.
*  And if you're lucky enough to still be
*  in the parenting child burden or being a child process,
*  then there's still time.
*  So I guess there's always still time.
*  In my introduction to this episode,
*  I touched on a few of these,
*  but tell us what you're doing these days
*  to help parents and kids indirectly or directly
*  to be more effective in their relationships.
*  And, you know, I know you've written about this in books
*  and you have a wonderful social media account on Instagram
*  and elsewhere, I follow it.
*  And there's oh, so much learning there.
*  But, you know, how are you translating this knowledge
*  into actionable programs?
*  Yeah, that is my, like,
*  that is what gets me out of bed every morning is translating.
*  I always say deep thoughts, actionable, practical,
*  can do with today's strategies.
*  Yes.
*  That's the only way I can work.
*  I'm like, tell me what to do to put that idea into action.
*  Love it.
*  So, you know, a couple of years ago,
*  one of the things that really struck me was just like,
*  I really did feel angry.
*  Like this is so messed up.
*  Parents have the hardest job
*  and it's the one that impacts the world the most.
*  And I don't think any of us think the world
*  is in like a great place right now.
*  Right?
*  No. It's not.
*  Right.
*  And this is, and I remember someone coming up to me
*  and saying, parenting is also the only job
*  you care about on your deathbed.
*  And I think that's probably true if you have kids.
*  So like, for every reason,
*  this should be the place that they're,
*  like that we invest the most
*  or that the system is like set up to help us, right?
*  And most people I know, they don't want to parent
*  the exact same way as they were parented,
*  maybe take parts.
*  And that is the way we'll parent.
*  It's just kind of the language we use.
*  And learning a new language we know is totally possible.
*  Like Duolingo has showed us that.
*  You can learn a new language.
*  It's hard.
*  Sometimes you revert to your language of origin,
*  especially in stressful moments, same thing parenting,
*  and then you go back.
*  And so I remember saying to some people around me,
*  like, I want to create that like kind of Duolingo
*  for parents.
*  It is learning a new language.
*  And we should have a product
*  where we have resources in one place.
*  We should be able to connect to other parents
*  around the globe.
*  We're kind of doing this with us.
*  We should have access to experts we trust,
*  not because they always know better,
*  but they might just help us have a different mindset
*  and some ideas to help us again.
*  And me, my mind is just act more in line
*  with your own values.
*  That's what it's about.
*  And so that's what we created.
*  And that's what I'm working on.
*  And that's our Good Inside membership.
*  And so excited about all the ways, you know,
*  that's already impacting tens and tens of thousands
*  of parents and that's where the resources are.
*  It's bite-sized, it's actionable.
*  We're really known for our scripts.
*  It's like, what do I say to my kid when?
*  Like literally, we have a script for that.
*  And I think in a small way, people like they,
*  like I come for the scripts
*  and then I stay for the revolution.
*  Like this is actually a journey of my own sturdiness.
*  And honestly, becoming a sturdier, more confident leader
*  is the only way we can raise sturdy, more confident kids.
*  I've said this again and again throughout today's discussion,
*  but I love it.
*  I love the gathering of information,
*  the organizing it and dispersing it in actionable ways.
*  And you've done all of that and you're continuing to do that.
*  And you also have the clinical background
*  and you're a parent.
*  So you're speaking from professional
*  and immediate experience
*  and you put oh, so much work into it.
*  I can tell that by the directness and simplicity
*  of the actionables that you've taught us today.
*  And also how much resides underneath
*  those direct, simple actionables.
*  Just beautiful.
*  I've had many conversations on this podcast
*  with many brilliant people, including yourself.
*  But this is among the ones that I really say
*  has really me thinking.
*  And I don't think I've ever said, wow,

*  and are certainly engaged in other forms of relationship.
