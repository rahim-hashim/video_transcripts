# Dr. Noam Sobel: How Smells Influence Our Hormones, Health & Behavior | Huberman Lab Podcast
**Andrew Huberman:** [May 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cS7cNaBrkxo)
*  Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
*  where we discuss science
*  and science-based tools for everyday life.
*  I'm Andrew Huberman,
*  and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
*  at Stanford School of Medicine.
*  Today, my guest is Dr. Noam Sobel.
*  Dr. Noam Sobel is a professor of neurobiology
*  in the Department of Brain Sciences
*  at the Weizmann Institute of Science.
*  His laboratory studies olfaction and chemosensation.
*  Olfaction is, of course, our sense of smell.
*  Chemosensation is our ability to respond to chemicals
*  in our environment.
*  Today, you are going to learn some absolutely incredible
*  facts about how you interact with the world
*  and other people around you.
*  For instance, you will learn that humans
*  can smell things around them as well as dogs can.
*  In fact, humans are incredibly good
*  at sensing the chemical world around them.
*  You also learn, for instance,
*  that every time you meet somebody,
*  you are taking chemicals from that person,
*  either from the chemical cloud that surrounds them
*  or directly from the surface of their body,
*  and you are actually applying it to your own body
*  and you are processing information
*  about that person's chemicals
*  to determine many things about them,
*  including how stressed they are, their hormone levels,
*  things that operate at a subconscious level
*  on your brain and nervous system
*  and that impact your emotions, your decision-making,
*  and who you choose to relate to or not to relate to.
*  You will also learn that tears, yes,
*  the tears of others are impacting your hormone levels
*  in powerful ways.
*  You will also learn that every so often,
*  actually on a regular schedule,
*  there is an alternation of ease
*  through which you can breathe
*  through one nostril or the other,
*  and that alternation reflects an underlying dynamic
*  of your nervous system and has a lot to do
*  with how alert or sleepy you happen to be.
*  The list of things that Dr. Noam Sobel's laboratory
*  has discovered that relate to everyday life
*  and that are going to make you say,
*  wow, I can't believe that happens,
*  but then go out into the real world
*  and actually observe that that happens
*  in ways that are incredibly interesting,
*  just goes on and on.
*  In fact, his laboratory discovered
*  that we are always sensing our own odors.
*  That's right, even though you might not notice
*  your own smell, you are always sensing your own odor cloud,
*  and throughout the day,
*  you periodically smell yourself deliberately,
*  even though you might not realize it,
*  in order to change your cognition and behavior.
*  I first learned of Dr. Sobel's laboratory
*  through a rather odd observance.
*  That observance took place when I was a graduate student
*  many years ago at UC Berkeley.
*  At the time, Noam Sobel was a professor at UC Berkeley.
*  As I mentioned before, he has since moved to the Weisman.
*  Well, I was walking through the Berkeley campus
*  and I saw people on their hands and knees,
*  but with their head very close to the ground,
*  and their eyes were covered, their hands were covered,
*  their mouths were covered,
*  and only their nose was exposed.
*  And what I was observing was an experiment being conducted
*  by the Sobel laboratory,
*  in which humans were following a scent trail.
*  That scent trail was actually buried some depth
*  underneath the earth,
*  and yet they could follow that scent trail
*  with a high degree of fidelity.
*  It was from that experiment and other experiments done
*  in Dr. Sobel's laboratory at Berkeley and at the Weisman,
*  involving neuroimaging and a number of other tools
*  and techniques that revealed the incredible power
*  of human olfaction and humans' ability
*  to follow scent trails if they need to.
*  And that of course led to many other important discoveries,
*  some of which I alluded to a few moments ago,
*  but you are going to learn about many, many other
*  important discoveries in the realm of olfaction
*  and chemo sensation that have been carried out
*  by Dr. Sobel's laboratory
*  through the course of today's episode.
*  And by the end of today's episode,
*  I assure you that you will never look at or smell
*  the world around you the same way again.
*  Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
*  is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
*  It is, however, part of my desire and effort
*  to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
*  and science-related tools to the general public.
*  In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors
*  of today's podcast.
*  Our first sponsor is Roka.
*  Roka makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
*  that are of the absolute highest quality.
*  I've spent a lifetime working on the biology
*  of the visual system, and I can tell you
*  that your visual system has to contend
*  with an enormous number of challenges
*  in order for you to be able to see clearly.
*  Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses were designed
*  with the biology of the visual system in mind.
*  So no matter whether or not you're wearing them for sport,
*  whether or not you're wearing them for work
*  or for socializing, you can always see with crystal clarity.
*  Their glasses are extremely lightweight,
*  so most of the time you don't even realize
*  that you're wearing them.
*  I wear Roka readers at night,
*  and sometimes when I drive at night,
*  and I wear Roka sunglasses throughout the day,
*  except, of course, I do not wear them
*  for my morning sunlight viewing.
*  If you'd like to try Roka eyeglasses or sunglasses,
*  go to roka, that's R-O-K-A, .com,
*  and enter the code Huberman to save 20% off your first order.
*  Again, that's R-O-K-A, .com,
*  and enter the code Huberman at checkout.
*  Today's episode is also brought to us by Thesis.
*  Thesis makes custom nootropics,
*  and nootropics is a word that I do not like,
*  because it means smart drugs.
*  As a neurobiologist, I can tell you
*  that there is no neural circuit in your brain
*  for being smart.
*  There are neural circuits for focus,
*  there are neural circuits for memory,
*  there are neural circuits for creativity,
*  and there are neural circuits for task switching.
*  Thesis understands that there's a diversity
*  of neural circuits that support
*  different brain body states,
*  and therefore have designed nootropics
*  that are customized to achieve specific brain body states.
*  If you go to the Thesis website and take a brief quiz,
*  they will design a nootropic starter kit.
*  Some of those nootropics that they'll send you
*  are designed to enhance your focus,
*  others for clarity, others for creativity, and so on.
*  To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,
*  you can go to takethesis.com, slash, Huberman,
*  and take a three minute quiz,
*  and Thesis will send you four different formulas
*  to try in your first month.
*  That's takethesis.com, slash, Huberman,
*  and use the code Huberman at checkout
*  to get 10% off your first order.
*  Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep.
*  Helix Sleep makes customized mattresses and pillows
*  that allow you to get the best possible night's sleep.
*  So if you go to the Helix website,
*  you can take a very brief quiz,
*  it only takes about two minutes,
*  and answer questions such as,
*  do you tend to sleep on your back,
*  or your side, or your stomach?
*  Do you tend to run hot or cold throughout the night?
*  Maybe you don't know the answers to those questions,
*  but they'll match you to a mattress
*  that's ideal for your sleep needs.
*  For me, that was the Dusk DUSK mattress,
*  which is not too firm and not too soft,
*  and I've been sleeping on it for more than two years,
*  and it's the best sleep that I've ever had.
*  If you'd like to try a Helix mattress,
*  go to helixsleep.com, slash, Huberman,
*  take that two minute quiz,
*  and they'll match you to a customized mattress,
*  and you'll get up to $350 off any mattress order,
*  and two free pillows.
*  Again, if you're interested,
*  you can go to helixsleep.com, slash, Huberman,
*  for up to $350 off and two free pillows.
*  And now for my discussion with Dr. Noam Sobel.
*  Dr. Sobel, Noam, welcome.
*  Thank you.
*  Must say, I am extremely excited for this conversation.
*  I've been a huge fan of your work
*  for more than a decade or two.
*  Yes. Kind of frightening.
*  Yeah.
*  We overlapped at UC Berkeley some time ago,
*  although we did not meet.
*  Although we lived in the same apartment.
*  And we just learned that the amazing apartment
*  that you moved out of was the apartment
*  that my girlfriend and I at the time moved into in 2006,
*  I believe.
*  So, we've shared quite a few things.
*  And today I'd love for you to share with us
*  all about the amazing landscape of chemo sensation,
*  in particular olfaction, our sense of smell,
*  and some related perceptual abilities,
*  or subconscious abilities, including pheromones, et cetera.
*  To get everybody on the same page,
*  I'd like to just start off by asking,
*  what are the major components of our ability to smell?
*  Obviously, where I like to think
*  it involves the nose at some level.
*  It does.
*  To what extent is that mixed in with other senses,
*  like taste?
*  And perhaps more importantly,
*  what about the chemicals that we are sensing
*  through this thing?
*  And for those of you listening and not watching,
*  I'm tapping my nose, that we are not aware of.
*  The chemicals that we're inhaling
*  and making sense of without our awareness.
*  If you could just give us the top contour,
*  or even deep contour if you like,
*  of the parts list and the various roles they play.
*  So, you've asked a lot of questions at once.
*  I'll start with a little comment on the way
*  you said smelling through our nose,
*  which we indeed do,
*  but we also smell through our mouth, actually.
*  There's a process referred to as retronasal olfaction,
*  where odorants come up through the back of our throat
*  and out of our nose the reverse way.
*  And we smell things that way as well.
*  And in fact, a big part of the contribution of olfaction
*  to food and taste comes from that,
*  from retronasal olfaction.
*  But primary olfaction is referred to as orthonasal olfaction,
*  that is through our nose we sniff,
*  and sniffing is a big thing.
*  Well, I have a sense we might talk about that a lot today
*  in all sorts of contexts.
*  So we sniff in through our nose,
*  and to answer your general question
*  of the organization of the system,
*  so airborne molecules travel up our nose,
*  a distance in the human of about six or seven centimeters
*  to about here, where they interact with,
*  I will use the word sheet of receptors,
*  but sheet is a bit misleading here.
*  It's not a sheet, it's very convoluted.
*  We have about seven million such receptors
*  lining a structure known as the olfactory epithelium.
*  This is the sensory surface of the olfactory system,
*  the olfactory epithelium.
*  Again, about, probably about six or seven million receptors
*  in the human.
*  In the human, probably about 350 different kinds.
*  So that's amazing.
*  That means a meaningful percentage of your genome
*  is devoted just to this,
*  just to the kinds of olfactory receptor subtypes
*  you have in your nose.
*  By the way, I can share an amusing story.
*  I would imagine amusing stories are good for podcasts.
*  So that number of six or seven million receptors
*  is probably not very well grounded.
*  It's hard to count, but it's reasonably grounded.
*  And there was this thing roaming around in the literature
*  about bloodhounds having billion receptors in their nose,
*  which is why they're so amazing.
*  And this number was, it sort of propagated
*  through the literature.
*  And our lab has written over the years,
*  a few review chapters,
*  and we were repeatedly writing the olfaction chapter
*  for a very large, one of these large textbooks,
*  the Gazaniga Handbook of Cognitive Neuroscience,
*  I think it's called.
*  And we had that in there as well somewhere.
*  And one time when we were renewing the chapter
*  for a new version of the book,
*  I told the graduate student who was leading that
*  at the time, Araya Sheroon,
*  she's now a professor at Tel Aviv University.
*  I told her, check that, check that reference out.
*  Where in the world did that come from?
*  And we started going back and back and back.
*  And it turns out it comes from a textbook,
*  an Australian textbook.
*  And we found the author of the textbook and we wrote her
*  and I said, look, there's this thing in the literature
*  of a billion receptors in the bloodhound.
*  Where did that come from?
*  And surprisingly she answered me.
*  And I was hoping to get a reference, right?
*  But it wasn't a reference.
*  And this is where it really becomes funny for us
*  because she said, I was once at a lecture
*  of an olfaction geneticists,
*  geneticists by the name of Doron Lancet.
*  And he said that in the lecture.
*  Now this is really funny because she's in Australia,
*  this is all over the world, this number,
*  and I'm writing her from Israel
*  and Doron Lancet is in the building next to me, okay?
*  And Whitespun Institute of Genetics,
*  I mean, he used to be, he's retired now.
*  And he had meaningful contributions
*  in the history of olfaction.
*  So I picked up the internal phone and I said,
*  hey, Doron, did you say that there's a billion receptors
*  in the bloodhound nose?
*  And he said, what's a bloodhound?
*  So this was totally made up, right?
*  It totally made up and it propagated.
*  I mean, you can probably go into Google
*  and type like a billion receptors in the bloodhound
*  and you'll get a lot of hits.
*  But there was absolutely no evidence for that.
*  Amazing and not just amazing in light of what it tells us
*  about olfaction in bloodhounds or otherwise,
*  but amazing because it sheds light on just how much
*  of what is in textbooks, scientific and medical
*  is absolutely wrong.
*  Things propagate and you cite yourself.
*  So we fixed that in that version of the.
*  And so to finish the line, so Odorans interact
*  with these receptors here in our epithelium
*  where they undergo what is referred to as transduction.
*  That is the Odorans are docked at a receptor
*  and turn into a neural signal or enforce the receptor
*  to respond in a neural signal.
*  And this neural signal, in fact, action potentials,
*  not gradient potentials of any kind,
*  propagates via the olfactory nerve.
*  Now this is a nerve that goes from our epithelium
*  right here behind the forehead.
*  Well, yeah, yeah, here through the thinnest part
*  of our skull, an area referred to as the cribriform plate,
*  which is perforated.
*  It has a lot of holes.
*  The nerve goes through those holes and synapses
*  at the first target in the brain,
*  which is the olfactory bulb.
*  And humans, that forms an interesting point of sensitivity
*  because a lot of people lose their sense of smell
*  due to trauma because of that structure.
*  A head hit type trauma.
*  Well, yes, although you denoted hitting
*  on the front of the head,
*  which is where all this real estate is,
*  but actually the more common cause
*  for losing your sense of smell for trauma
*  is the back of the head
*  because of what's referred to as a contricue injury.
*  So as your listeners probably know,
*  our brain is floating in liquid in CSF
*  and cerebrospinal fluid inside our skull.
*  And when we get hit in the back of the head,
*  the brain has this forward and backward movement
*  in the liquid in the skull.
*  It sort of crashes.
*  It can crash against the front of the skull,
*  which is why you also have in a contricue injury,
*  you also often have frontal damage.
*  But what happens is that this generates a shearing motion
*  on the cribriform plate and the olfactory nerve is severed.
*  And if it's completely severed, it's lost.
*  Forever, because my understanding is
*  that the olfactory sensory neurons
*  are among the few central nervous system neurons
*  in adult humans that can regenerate
*  or replenish themselves.
*  Right, so again, there are a few questions in one.
*  So first of all-
*  We will spin many plates simultaneously.
*  If it's completely severed, completely,
*  then yes, you're lost.
*  Forever.
*  Yeah, if it's completely severed,
*  because even if you'll have regeneration
*  at the basal cell level at the epithelium,
*  they won't manage to find their way back to the bulb.
*  If you have partial or something left
*  or something shows up in a short while after the injury,
*  then you have a good chance of recovery.
*  Because they grow along the trajectory of the other axons
*  or pioneering the way for them.
*  Assumingly, yeah.
*  Interesting.
*  And so basically, the timeframe,
*  and you know, it's funny, I get a lot of emails on this,
*  although I'm not a medical doctor,
*  but I get a lot of emails from people
*  who have lost their sense of smell
*  because it's very distressing.
*  And now more people know this because of COVID,
*  that it's very distressing.
*  And basically the rule of thumb is that
*  if you don't get it back within a year to year and a half,
*  you'll never get it back.
*  My understanding of the statistics on olfactory loss
*  and COVID and other viral type infections is that,
*  first of all, I experienced that when I got COVID.
*  Including total anosmia?
*  For one day.
*  And not total.
*  It was just, there was a remnant of an ability to smell
*  or perceive the smell of a lemon,
*  and I was huffing as hard as I possibly could.
*  I actually, there's an over the counter remedy,
*  and this is not a pseudoscience
*  because there's a number of papers published about this
*  on PubMed that alpha lipoic acid
*  can accelerate the recovery of smell.
*  Yeah.
*  And so that's something that it worked successfully for me.
*  I'm not saying that that's the only route.
*  You don't know if it worked successfully for you
*  or if you would have recovered anyway.
*  I mean, you didn't do a controlled study.
*  True, but I was not willing to do the control experiment.
*  Exactly.
*  Let me say two things on this front.
*  First, the date on the alpha lipoic acid is, ugh.
*  Yeah, it's not overwhelming.
*  But losing your sense of smell is overwhelming.
*  Yeah, no, no, I know.
*  And so I think people feel desperate.
*  One word about smelling the lemon,
*  and this is, I'll take that opportunity
*  to share more information.
*  When we smell things,
*  it's the result of more sensory subsystems
*  than the olfactory system alone.
*  So you have several chemo-sensory sensitive nerves
*  in your nose.
*  A primary one beyond the olfactory nerve
*  is the trigeminal nerve, the fifth cranial nerve.
*  So the trigeminal nerve has sensory endings
*  in your nose, in your throat, and in your eye.
*  It has three branches.
*  That's why an onion has a smell and burns your eyes
*  and burns in your throat.
*  Is that why? It's trigeminal, yeah.
*  The tearing of cutting an onion is trigeminal.
*  It's a trigeminal reflex.
*  Amazing.
*  We talked about trigeminal in the context of headache
*  during a headache episode.
*  It's a trigeminal reflex.
*  So the lemon you are smelling
*  may have been a trigeminal sensation.
*  So smelling the lemon with my eyes is what you're saying.
*  Well, no, with your nose,
*  but with your trigeminal receptors
*  and not your olfactory receptors.
*  So within olfaction researcher jargon,
*  there's what we refer to as pure olfactants.
*  These are odors that will stimulate
*  your olfactory nerve alone.
*  They won't influence your trigeminal nerve at all.
*  And an example, just to get a sense of what that might be,
*  would be the coffee right here is a pure olfactant.
*  Vanilla is a known pure olfactant.
*  These things have no trigeminal activation.
*  As long as we're on this topic
*  and we'll weave back and forth,
*  but I'm glad we are on this topic
*  because a tremendous number of people wrote to me
*  during the pandemic and continue to about olfactory loss.
*  I've heard of this olfactory training
*  whereby if you have a partial
*  or even a complete loss of primary olfaction
*  that one is encouraged to smell
*  a number of different smells.
*  I grew up studying activity dependent wiring
*  of the nervous system.
*  It makes total sense to me why keeping neurons active
*  keeps them alive.
*  So this is not fire together, wire together type thing.
*  By the way, that's a quote from Carla Schatz,
*  not Donald Head folks or me.
*  But this is about keeping neurons electrically active,
*  in this case olfactory neurons
*  in order to maintain their connections
*  because otherwise they will die.
*  Olfaction is a definite use it or lose it system.
*  And so that makes total sense.
*  And indeed there's very strong evidence for success
*  of the training programs more than the alpha lipoic acid.
*  And so that's a real thing.
*  And what's cool about that is that you don't need
*  to go out and buy expensive things, although you can.
*  Of course, there are people who are capitalizing
*  on this commercially already,
*  but you can just take things from your refrigerator
*  or your makeup cabinet or whatever
*  and smell them attentionally and constantly and sniff them.
*  And that exposure will help you recover.
*  There is good data on that by now.
*  You made that point in passing about regeneration
*  in the olfactory system.
*  And neither one of the cool things.
*  In olfaction, you can study many things through olfaction.
*  And indeed one of them is neuroregeneration
*  because the olfactory neurons are really the only neurons
*  that do that systematically in the adult mammalian brain.
*  And whether the human olfactory system
*  shows the same level of regeneration
*  as it does in other mammals is and was somewhat questionable.
*  And I'm just bringing that up to share a really cool study
*  that was published in Neuron, I think somewhere around 2014
*  where to address this question,
*  I just really liked the idea of doing that.
*  What the authors did was look at in postmortem,
*  they looked at levels of C14 in adults
*  who were exposed to atomic bomb experiments.
*  You can actually look at these neurons
*  and time them based on exposure to radiation.
*  And that paper suggested that there's not as much turnover
*  in the human olfactory bulb as there is in other mammals.
*  Other lines of data suggest otherwise.
*  So this is kind of a debated question
*  as to what extent of neurodegeneration you have
*  in the human olfactory system as opposed to other mammals.
*  But that was just a really cool paper, I think,
*  of doing that.
*  Fascinating.
*  Should I finish the path just so we have that?
*  So we said, so information then synapses
*  at the olfactory bulb from the olfactory epithelium.
*  And the pattern of that synapsing follows
*  what's referred to as the most extreme case of convergence
*  in the mammalian nervous system.
*  More specifically, what happens is that all the receptors
*  of a given subtype, and remember, in humans,
*  we said we have about 350.
*  In the mouse, we have about 1,200 probably.
*  So all the receptors of one subtype converge
*  to one location in the bulb.
*  And this location is referred to as a glomerulus
*  or an implore glomeruli.
*  And that may be a slight oversimplification.
*  It's in fact two glomeruli.
*  There's a mirror, sort of a mirror cut line.
*  And so all the receptors of one subtype
*  will converge to two mirror glomeruli on the olfactory bulb.
*  So you end up having two glomeruli
*  that reflect that one receptor subtype.
*  And so if, and this is as far as,
*  I'm giving you now the textbook view of how the system works,
*  but then I can, I'll happily share with you things
*  that pose a problem for the textbook view
*  of how things work.
*  But the textbook view of how things work
*  is that every such receptor subtype
*  is responsive to a small subset
*  of different molecular shapes,
*  what's sometimes referred to as ototopes,
*  the molecular aspects of the odorant.
*  So each receptor is responsive to a different subset
*  of ototopes, let's say 10,
*  and each ototope will activate a different subset
*  of receptors.
*  So potentially you have this insane comment in twerks
*  of this potentially 350 dimensional space
*  in the human potentially.
*  But then because of this convergence,
*  you end up having on the bulb in a way a map
*  reflecting receptor identity.
*  So let's say this coffee activates receptors
*  of type one, three, and seven.
*  So the glomeruli of receptors one, three, and seven
*  will light up quote unquote when I smell the coffee.
*  And if you can take a snapshot of that,
*  theoretically you would have the map of coffee
*  and so on and so forth.
*  This is sort of the textbook view of how the system works.
*  And then information goes from the bulb
*  to several targets in the brain.
*  I mean, what is referred to as primary olfactory cortex
*  is piriform cortex and an enthorhinal cortex.
*  This is on the ventral surface of the brain,
*  the lower portion of our temporal lobe,
*  and information goes there directly,
*  but it also goes directly to the amygdala.
*  It probably goes directly to the hypothalamus.
*  It may go directly to the cerebellum.
*  It goes all over the brain.
*  So information projects widely from there.
*  And as far as people understand,
*  the map that may exist on the bulb
*  doesn't exist in the rest of the brain.
*  And the understanding of how coding occurs
*  in the rest of the brain is murky.
*  Commonly one hears that the memories that we have of odors
*  are somehow more robust than the memories
*  of other perceptual events in our life.
*  I don't know if this is true or not,
*  but people will say, for instance,
*  I can still remember the smell of my grandmother's hands
*  or the smell of cookies in her kitchen.
*  At a minimum, it points to the fact that
*  smell and memory are closely linked.
*  And you just mentioned a direct, you know, multi-station,
*  but nonetheless somewhat direct path from the nostrils
*  to the hippocampus,
*  one of the primary encoding centers of memory.
*  Two synapses away.
*  Yeah, which is a remarkably short pathway,
*  considering that, for instance, just by example,
*  because some of our listeners
*  won't be familiar with this,
*  but some will, that sound waves that, you know,
*  are transduced into neural signals
*  at the level of the inner ear go through many stations
*  before they arrive at the location in the brain
*  where we make sense of those sound waves
*  as voices or music, et cetera.
*  Whereas olfaction is more of a direct route
*  to the memory centers.
*  Is there any just-so story
*  or real objective truth to the idea
*  that olfactory memories are formed more easily
*  or maintained longer or more robustly
*  than other sorts of memories?
*  So, yes.
*  But first I should say that I'm not
*  an authority on olfactory memory.
*  It's sort of, olfactory memory is a huge field of research
*  and somehow our lab has never really
*  gone much into that.
*  Although, again, the same student I happen to talk about,
*  before Yari Sharun, who's again now a faculty at Tel Aviv,
*  ran a study, a paper, I think we published
*  in Current Biology called The Privilege Representation
*  of Early Olfacterious Associations.
*  Basically, there's something about the first time
*  you experience a smell that generates
*  a particularly robust representation
*  more than other sensory stimuli,
*  and that's what she in fact compared.
*  So there's something about the first exposure to a smell
*  in terms of the brain encoding
*  that etches it into our being.
*  And this is an effect that has,
*  it has echoes of course in literature.
*  I mean, the biggest cliche in this
*  is to bring up the Proust effect, right?
*  So the Proust effect is when he ate the madeleine
*  and it immediately, the taste and smell immediately
*  reminded him of an event in his childhood
*  where the same madeleine appeared.
*  But so that's something very real.
*  There's a lot of research on it not coming from our work.
*  So I'm not an authority.
*  But it does sound like there's something special
*  about Olfaction, and that doesn't mean
*  that there isn't something special
*  about vision or audition.
*  Each one has its own unique.
*  I'm the last to argue that there's something special
*  about Olfaction.
*  My students make fun of me because they say
*  and there's some truth to that
*  that I try to explain everything
*  through the olfactory system.
*  I mean, for me, everything is olfactory.
*  So yes.
*  Through the lens of the nose,
*  I'd like to take a quick break
*  and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.
*  Athletic Greens now called AG1
*  is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
*  that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.
*  I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012.
*  So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
*  The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
*  and the reason I still take Athletic Greens once
*  or usually twice a day is that it gets to be
*  the probiotics that I need for gut health.
*  Our gut is very important.
*  It's populated by gut microbiota
*  that communicate with the brain, the immune system
*  and basically all the biological systems of our body
*  to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.
*  And those probiotics and Athletic Greens are optimal
*  and vital for microbiotic health.
*  In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number
*  of adaptogens, vitamins and minerals
*  that make sure that all of my foundational
*  and nutritional needs are met.
*  And it tastes great.
*  If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
*  you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman
*  and they'll give you five free travel packs
*  that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens
*  while you're on the road, in the car, on the plane, et cetera.
*  And they'll give you a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
*  Again, that's athleticgreens.com slash Huberman
*  to get the five free travel packs
*  and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.
*  When I was at Berkeley, I was walking across campus one day
*  and I saw, I think students, but I saw people
*  on their hands and knees with goggles on, gloves on.
*  And I think their mouths were covered too.
*  Everything was covered.
*  Was covered and they were walking,
*  well, they were crawling along the ground.
*  And I thought this was peculiar,
*  but then again, it's UC Berkeley.
*  And the joke is if it, to get noticed
*  on the UC Berkeley campus, you have to be naked
*  and on fire, right?
*  One or the other would not be sufficient.
*  Please don't run this experiment, anybody.
*  It's that kind of place.
*  But nonetheless, a paper came out a few years later
*  describing the results of what turned out to be
*  your experiment that your laboratory was running,
*  which was having people follow an odor trail
*  with their nose.
*  And my understanding is that people can improve
*  their ability to track scents quite robustly,
*  especially if we deprive them of vision
*  and some other sensation that is touch
*  and some other sensations.
*  Maybe you could just tell us a little bit about that study.
*  And I think in our audience, I'm suspecting
*  that many people have a keen, keen sense of smell.
*  I have a family member who just like detect
*  any negative, you know, putrid odor in the environment,
*  but also good odors.
*  Exquisitely well, and I have other family members
*  whose sense of smell is quite poor.
*  I'd love for all of those people to learn a bit
*  about what is possible in terms of training up
*  or improving our ability to smell.
*  And perhaps in the context of that study, if you will.
*  Yeah, so first, before even talking about improving,
*  just off the bat, humans have a remarkable sense of smell.
*  And this is something, again, in our lab,
*  we already said, you know, yeah, we know this.
*  This is old news, but to people who come
*  from different worlds, we have to reiterate this.
*  Sometimes when I give, you know, public lectures
*  to non-all-faction audiences, I reiterate this.
*  Humans have an utterly remarkable sense of smell.
*  To put that a bit into sort of, you know,
*  things that are tangible.
*  So for example, mercaptans, which are added
*  to cooking gas so that we smell it,
*  because otherwise it wouldn't have a smell.
*  So that the smell of gas is not the smell of gas,
*  it's an additive.
*  Mercaptan.
*  Yeah, it's mercaptan.
*  The smell for light smell.
*  So our detection threshold, that is the level
*  at which we can detect it, is 0.2 parts per billion.
*  Okay, there's no machine that can really do that
*  that effectively, no gas chromatograph, nothing.
*  Now, to give you another sense of making this, again,
*  really tangible, we're working with a noterant
*  in our lab called estretetraenol,
*  that our participants can detect when we have it mixed
*  at 10 to the negative 12 molar in the liquid phase.
*  To give you a real sense of that, we did the math,
*  if you would take two Olympic-sized swimming pools
*  and you would pipe it one ml, one drop,
*  into one pool versus the other,
*  you could smell the difference between the pools.
*  Incredible.
*  That's the detection threshold that you have
*  with your nose.
*  People have an utterly amazing nose.
*  Okay, so that's just in terms of its detection abilities,
*  which are just remarkable, really up there
*  in the mammalian world.
*  We're not a bad mammal at all factions.
*  And beyond that, we can improve.
*  Okay, and the example you're talking about
*  actually started off as a lab bet.
*  Okay, we were having a lab picnic,
*  so I guess I should hear Flynn,
*  because I'm your guest from the Weizmann Institute
*  of Science in Israel,
*  but before going back to my home in Israel,
*  I was a faculty at UC Berkeley
*  in the Helen Wells Neuroscience Institute,
*  and this study was done during that time.
*  And we were on a lab picnic,
*  and we were having indeed one of these sort of lab
*  discussions, arguments on what humans can and can't do
*  with their sense of smell.
*  And I said that humans can truly even track odor
*  like a dog and people there said no way.
*  And we ran this quick experiment, which I have video of,
*  but I don't think we'll show it here.
*  But I actually have original, the picnic video, we have it.
*  And a graduate student by the name of Christina Zalano,
*  a brilliant graduate student at that time,
*  who's now, she's now a professor at Northwestern.
*  And she's really leading the field
*  of all faction imaging today.
*  But she was the volunteer, and we dragged a chocolate bar
*  across the grass and blindfolded her
*  and checked if she could track the track we made
*  with the chocolate, which she did very effectively.
*  And as far as-
*  Did you place her at the starting point of the line?
*  Or?
*  I think we did.
*  I don't exactly remember what we did
*  on that sort of picnic tryout.
*  But I assume she never practiced that in her life before.
*  And yet, she did it really, really well.
*  And then this went on as a lab bed in a way
*  that I said to my students,
*  okay, we have to make this into an experiment,
*  put it in an experimental setting
*  and quantify what's going on.
*  And they all said that it would be uninteresting.
*  That was the bet.
*  And I told them it would be in nature,
*  which is a bet I won in this case.
*  Nature of course being one of the three
*  apex journals science.
*  It was nature neuroscience to be fair.
*  But so then we turned it into an experiment.
*  And what the experiment was
*  is that we brought in participants,
*  naive participants, not graduates from our lab,
*  completely deprived them of any other sensory input.
*  So we blocked their eyes, we blocked their ears,
*  we blocked everything.
*  They were wearing heavy gloves.
*  They couldn't sense anything.
*  And we generated a consistent odor path in the grass,
*  which is what you saw.
*  We did that by burying twine under the grass
*  an odor impregnated twine.
*  So that way we could generate a consistent
*  odor trail every time.
*  Was it at the base of the grass or in the dirt?
*  It was buried.
*  It was buried under the grass.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  Wow.
*  I did not know that.
*  It was buried under the grass.
*  And we conducted aerial photography
*  and participants also had this sensor pack
*  that they were wearing,
*  where we measured nasal airflow in each nostril in real time.
*  And we also used something called RTK GPS,
*  which is a way to lay radio frequency grid
*  over the GPS grid so that you have millimeter resolution
*  in space basically.
*  It's used by surveyors mostly
*  so that we can track behavior.
*  And we found a few things doing this.
*  One is that people could just do this right off the bat.
*  The second thing we found that is when we train them up,
*  then within average of four days,
*  the rate limiting factor became the speed
*  at which they could crawl.
*  So as fast as you could crawl, you could send track.
*  Of course, you can't crawl as fast as a dog can run,
*  but as fast as you can crawl, you can send track.
*  And then to sort of add what made it really interesting
*  from a systems neuroscience perspective,
*  is that we asked whether having two nostrils
*  contributes to this.
*  So we constructed a nasal prosthesis, if you will,
*  that had two versions.
*  One is that it combined both nostrils
*  into one big nostril centered,
*  and the other is that it maintained two separated nostrils.
*  And we compared performance under these two conditions,
*  and people performed better with two nostrils
*  over one centralized nostril,
*  although the flow remained the same.
*  So you're taking advantage of the information
*  that comes from your two separate,
*  totally separate nostrils.
*  By the way, the system I described before
*  of your epithelium and bulb and connection to cortex,
*  you have two of those, right?
*  It's completely unilateral,
*  well, almost completely unilateral system.
*  There are some very small exceptions to that.
*  So a representation on both sides of the brain.
*  Much in the same way we have two eyes,
*  we're not a cyclops,
*  we can gain depth perception information,
*  we can perceive motion better as a consequence,
*  and a number of depth, especially stereopsis.
*  And we can locate sound
*  because of the difference between our ears
*  and how head blocks them between.
*  Amazing.
*  Another question about the mechanics and strategies
*  that you observed,
*  because I think there's information about the system,
*  the brain as a consequence.
*  Were you in a position to measure sniffing frequency
*  and the specific question I have is,
*  were people doing something along the lines of a
*  quick sniffing or a long draw in inhale?
*  So yes, we were measuring sniffing and recording it,
*  and we have all the data.
*  There was nothing very remarkable in that data,
*  in that study, although it may reflect
*  that we didn't analyze it carefully enough as well.
*  I mean, it wasn't a major component of our analysis.
*  So although we did look at it to some extent,
*  again, you're asking me about a paper
*  from quite a few years ago,
*  so I may be forgetting parts of it as well.
*  I'm sure if it was a major component of it,
*  it would have risen to the top.
*  It definitely wasn't a major finding
*  of the sniffing behavior in the paper,
*  although again, sniffing behavior
*  is a huge portion of our life and lab,
*  and it's taking us to places,
*  and it's reemerging now in our work.
*  We're doing tons of sniffing work.
*  I can share with you something that I think
*  will interest your listeners and viewers as well,
*  and we think is really one of the most overlooked things
*  in neuroscience.
*  I'll invite you to do the following experiment.
*  So occlude one nostril by pressing on it from the side
*  and sniff in, and then occlude the other and sniff in.
*  Do you sense a difference in flow?
*  Yes.
*  Okay, do you know why that is?
*  No, and it was the next question on my list.
*  Don't feel badly about not knowing why that is.
*  Most people don't, but that is a reflection
*  of something referred to as the nasal cycle.
*  So in fact, if you were to do that repeatedly,
*  you would find that your high flow nostril
*  and low flow nostril alternate
*  every two and a half hours on average.
*  In an absolute way, or is it kind of like a sine wave,
*  like gradual shift to the one and then gradual shift back?
*  It can vary.
*  It can vary, and we don't yet know the rules,
*  all the rules, but you have this constant shift
*  from side to side.
*  The shift becomes incredibly pronounced in sleep,
*  so we can measure the power of the difference,
*  and in sleep you have this phase shift of power.
*  You have a huge, like one closes and one opens totally.
*  And it turns out that this is linked to balance
*  in the autonomic nervous system.
*  So as you and your listeners know,
*  we have an autonomic nervous system
*  that has a sympathetic and parasympathetic component to it,
*  and they're in balance or imbalance in many diseases,
*  for example, and this interplay
*  between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system
*  drives the switch from left to right nostril.
*  Just to remind people, sympathetic nervous system
*  has nothing to do with sympathy.
*  It has everything to do with generating patterns
*  of alertness, it's sometimes called the fight or flight
*  system, but any pattern of arousal, positive or negative,
*  and then it's balanced in a coordinated way,
*  or at least in parallel with the parasympathetic
*  nervous system, which is sometimes called
*  the rest and digest system, but is associated
*  with all sorts of things, the sexual arousal response,
*  and a number of other aspects of our physiology.
*  So think of it like a seesaw of alertness and calm.
*  Perfect, so now imagine, right?
*  Imagine you would walk around living your life, right?
*  Half of the time with one eye closed like this,
*  and the other half with one eye closed like this,
*  and you had this eye cycle, right?
*  And that was linked to autonomic arousal.
*  I assure you, you would go to PubMed,
*  there would be five million papers on the eye cycle, right?
*  And the eye cycle in every disease you can name,
*  and what it denotes, and what it tells us,
*  and what we can do with it.
*  You have exactly this marker.
*  You're walking around with a marker on balance
*  in your autonomic nervous system,
*  and we do nothing with it.
*  So we're in fact now doing a lot with it, okay?
*  So we built a wearable device that is pasted to your body
*  and measures airflow in each nostril separately,
*  and logs it for 24 hours, and we're collecting
*  these 24 hour recordings.
*  We're calling it the nasal halter.
*  So we measure with the nasal halter,
*  and we're finding it is a disease marker.
*  I can give you a nasal halter measurement as an adult,
*  and I can say, this is work by Tim Nasseroka,
*  a graduate student in our lab now.
*  I can, so we can tell the difference between ADHD
*  and non-ADHD adults, and we can tell just from the recording,
*  we can tell if the adults are unriddling or not.
*  So I can measure your nasal airflow and say,
*  if you are or are not with ADHD,
*  and if you are or are not unriddling.
*  Incredible.
*  I have a couple of questions about this.
*  Is it the case that airflow through one nostril
*  is reflective of a sympathetic nervous system dominance
*  versus parasympathetic, or is it simply the case
*  that this alternating left-right nostril periodicity,
*  which you said I think is on the order
*  of about every two hours.
*  Two and a half. Two and a half.
*  It switches to maximal on one side versus the other.
*  Is that simply reflective of an overall balancing?
*  Maybe is it the hinge in the seesaw,
*  or is it the tilt of the seesaw?
*  So I don't have a good answer.
*  I don't have a good answer.
*  I mean, I could give you sort of a,
*  I could say that to some extent,
*  right nostril more open is more sympathetic,
*  and the left nostril more open is more parasympathetic,
*  but that wouldn't be very correct.
*  I mean, you know, it's super.
*  I'm sure that the yogis are gonna be all over this, right?
*  Because I get this, my lab does do some stuff on breathing,
*  and the yogis are always saying,
*  okay, you know, because there's this thing,
*  I don't do yoga anymore, not for any particular reason,
*  but where they'll have you breathe through one nostril
*  or the other, and I've probably been asked this question
*  on social media 10,000 times.
*  Okay, wait, I'm gonna become public enemy
*  number one of the yogis right now.
*  So listen, so we-
*  They'll come at you with yoga mats,
*  which are not very dangerous.
*  We really, so since we're so interested in this mechanism,
*  one of the things we'd really like to know how to do
*  is to gain control of it somehow.
*  And there's this world out there of yoga
*  who claims to have control over this.
*  So we said, okay, let's bring like really serious
*  yoga practitioners and see if they can shift
*  their nasal cycle from left to right by will alone, right?
*  Not by manipulating themselves somehow.
*  And if yes, we'll learn from them how they do this,
*  and then we might use this to cure ADHD or whatnot, right?
*  So we posted on all the lists of the yoga teachers
*  and had this parade of yoga teachers walking into our lab.
*  This was one of the strangest experiments.
*  A lot of sandalwood odors and bare feet.
*  Exactly.
*  White clothing and so on.
*  And so we studied, I actually know,
*  we studied 14 yoga teachers, all 14 by the conditions
*  of enlistment for this came in saying that they can control
*  shifting from left to right nostril.
*  Without plugging a nostril into a finger.
*  By the power of thought alone.
*  And you know how many of 14 succeeded?
*  Zero, including one, you know,
*  the most extreme one was we had this guy who, you know,
*  and we're recording, and we know how to record
*  this really well, right?
*  And he's sitting there saying, yeah, I'm switching now,
*  and it's switching.
*  And you know, you're looking at the monitor
*  and no, it's not switching.
*  And so no yoga teacher that we found could willfully switch
*  between left and right nostril flow.
*  And yet they are convinced that they are,
*  and I have to imagine they're not trying to, you know,
*  there's no incentive for them to lie, right?
*  Yeah, no, even the opposite.
*  I mean, you know, this puts them in an awkward position.
*  Once, yeah, I don't know what the deal is,
*  but none of them can do it.
*  Given that the alternating flow through one
*  or the other nostril is reflective
*  of the autonomic nervous system
*  has this two and a half hour periodicity,
*  if I suddenly enter a bout of stress, for instance,
*  does it switch?
*  Because that's reflective of the autonomic nervous system.
*  And the reason I'm asking this question
*  is not because I think that's necessarily important
*  as it relates to stress,
*  but I'm trying to understand the direction of causality.
*  In other words, is the unilateral smelling
*  or unilateral nostril smelling periodicity,
*  that when we named it something,
*  I could think of the wrong thing, I'm sure,
*  is that driving the shift in the autonomic nervous system
*  or is it merely reflective of the shift?
*  So you've very concisely now worded AIM2 of a grant
*  that was probably just rejected,
*  but basically we're trying to answer exactly that question
*  and we're currently running experiments on that line.
*  So we have one experiment where we're looking,
*  so we're exposing participants to pain.
*  We're using cold water and exposure.
*  It's a really cool paradigm
*  because there's huge individual differences.
*  We just started this, we built the setup just now,
*  and you have a lot of meat to work with there
*  because there's a lot of individual differences.
*  It's capped at three minutes,
*  for safety reasons, because you have participants
*  putting their hand in two degrees celsius water,
*  but there'll be participants who will pull it out
*  at like 10 seconds, nine seconds,
*  and then you'll have three minutes as well.
*  So there's lots of, and already,
*  so now I'm sharing pilot data with you,
*  so when this ends up being published,
*  it might be the opposite, but so far it seems
*  that the exposure to cold generates a shift
*  in the nasal balance.
*  So autonomic arousal can drive the shift potentially.
*  Earlier you were describing the architecture
*  of these smelling systems,
*  and you mentioned these glomeruli
*  where the olfactory receptors converge in the bulb,
*  and then later you mentioned that the system is unilateral
*  but with a mirror representation on both sides of the brain.
*  So for those who don't think in terms of neuroanatomy,
*  what Noam was describing is the fact that,
*  of course, there are two nostrils
*  and then a bunch of receptors,
*  they converge in these glomeruli,
*  but you have a mirror representation of that
*  on both sides of the brain,
*  and that most of that information
*  is kept on one side of the brain or the other.
*  There isn't a lot of extensive intermixing
*  at the first order of processing.
*  So the question I have is whether or not you believe,
*  I'm not asking for data, first I just wanna know
*  what you believe, that this alternating nostril
*  airflow phenomenon has anything to do
*  with preferential processing of olfactory information
*  in terms of right brain, left brain,
*  with the caveat that anytime we hear right brain,
*  left brain, we've covered this in a previous episode,
*  most of what people hear out there
*  about right brain, left brain,
*  emotionality, logical stuff is completely wrong,
*  completely wrong, doesn't exist, is a total fabrication,
*  and we'd like to abolish that myth,
*  but with that aside, or set aside rather,
*  what are your thoughts on why the information
*  would switch from one side of the brain
*  to the other at all?
*  Yeah, I don't think that the nasal cycle
*  is an olfaction story.
*  So I don't think that this was shaped
*  by the olfactory system, nor do I think
*  this has major impact on olfaction.
*  I think the nasal cycle story is a different story
*  about brain function.
*  So we have this sort of pet theory
*  where we're calling now the sniffing brain approach,
*  where basically we think that nasal inhalation
*  is timing and driving a lot of aspects and patterns
*  of neural activity and cognitive processing.
*  And this theory is olfaction inspired
*  in its beginning.
*  That is, I mean, if you think of the mammalian brain, right,
*  it's, which evolved from olfaction,
*  it's sitting there and in olfaction,
*  because olfaction depends on sniffing,
*  you have this situation where you have a sniff,
*  you have information, and then flat, nothing, right?
*  And then you have information and then nothing.
*  So information processing is one-to-one linked
*  to nasal inhalation.
*  And we think that this property evolved
*  to be meaningful in brain processing in general,
*  not only of olfactory information,
*  but of any type of information,
*  because the brain evolved in this way,
*  in this way that it processes information
*  on inhalation onset.
*  So a study led by Ofer Perl from our lab
*  two, three years ago, we looked at something
*  completely non-olfactory.
*  We looked at visual-spatial processing,
*  and we compared visual-spatial processing
*  on inhalation versus exhalation.
*  And the brain does this completely different
*  on inhalation versus exhalation.
*  In that particular task, people performed significantly
*  better on inhalation versus exhalation.
*  What was the task?
*  Was it an olfactory task?
*  No, no, it's a visual-spatial task.
*  So this is a task where the specifics of the task
*  were that you see a shape, and you have to determine
*  if it's a shape that can or cannot exist in the real world.
*  So some of them are these like usher shapes,
*  like where one facet doesn't reach the other facet.
*  The impossible figure type.
*  Yeah, but structural shapes.
*  And so a pure visual-spatial task,
*  we intentionally went for a task
*  that is not considered a ventral-temporal task,
*  an olfactory cortex task in any way.
*  And people performed much better on inhalation
*  versus exhalation at doing this task.
*  Was there a both nostrils occluded version
*  where people were forced to mouth breathe?
*  Yes, and in this particular task,
*  they also did better on mouth inhalation
*  versus mouth exhalation,
*  but the difference wasn't as pronounced as it was
*  with nasal inhalation versus exhalation.
*  I'm a big proponent of nasal, not mouth breathing,
*  whenever possible for many health-related reasons.
*  I'm a big fan of the book,
*  Jaws, a Hidden Epidemic,
*  written by colleagues of mine at Stanford.
*  Familiar with it.
*  And this idea that people who mouth breathe
*  experience more colds, more infections of various kinds.
*  It's not good aesthetically or for the dentures, dentature.
*  I never know the teeth, gums, it's stuff.
*  Sorry, my dentist is gonna come after me.
*  I need to go to the dentist anyway.
*  Nose breathing is great for your health
*  relative to mouth breathing.
*  So I think it's also good for your cognition,
*  not only for your dental health.
*  I think that nose breathing shapes cognition.
*  And there are other labs who are finding the same.
*  Again, Cristina Zellano is doing work on this line.
*  She had major contributions here.
*  And Johan Lundström is doing work on this line.
*  There's lots of studies suggesting
*  that nasal inhalation is timing cognitive processing
*  and modulating it.
*  Incredible, perhaps not surprising,
*  given what you've taught us about the olfactory system.
*  I mean, these two holes in the front of our face,
*  these nostrils, I mean, are a pathway to the brain.
*  I love to tell people,
*  because I work on the visual system in my lab,
*  that your eyes are two pieces of brain
*  extruded from the cranial vault,
*  which they are, the retinas anyhow.
*  And then you never look at anyone the same way again.
*  But the olfactory sensory neurons
*  are right there at the top.
*  So those caverns that we call nostrils,
*  and they are brain.
*  Yeah, definitely.
*  It's the only place where your brain
*  meets the outside world,
*  because in your retina, they're protected by a lens.
*  And here you have neurons in contact with the world.
*  This actually has been the source for some theories
*  on a potential route for neurodegenerative mechanisms.
*  So as you may know,
*  loss of the sense of smell is one of the,
*  if not the earliest sign of neurodegenerative disease.
*  So for example, in Parkinson's disease,
*  there's a loss in the sense of smell,
*  probably 10 years before any other symptom.
*  But people have failed to make this a diagnostic tool,
*  because it's nonspecific.
*  So it's not as if you could come to your doctor
*  and say, I'm losing my sense of smell.
*  And they'll say, oh, early sign of Parkinson's,
*  because you can have many reasons
*  to lose your sense of smell and so on.
*  But olfactory loss, again,
*  is an early sign of neurodegeneration.
*  And there's at least one theory,
*  particularly about Alzheimer's disease,
*  suggesting that Alzheimer's may be the result
*  of a pathogen that enters the brain
*  through the olfactory system.
*  How interesting.
*  It's not, of course, a mainstream
*  or widely accepted theory of any type,
*  but it just highlights this notion
*  that the nose is a path to our brain.
*  There are noninvasive readouts
*  of potential neurodegeneration,
*  such as visual tests,
*  because of the fact that the retinas
*  are part of the brain and loss of neurons in the retina
*  is often associated with other forms
*  of central degeneration, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, et cetera,
*  as it's a little more invasive than what you're describing.
*  I'm beginning to wonder why we don't have
*  an olfactory task every time we go to the doctor
*  that would allow tracking over time,
*  of course, as you mentioned,
*  someone can lose their sense of smell.
*  Does that mean they're getting Alzheimer's?
*  Not necessarily, but if their sense of smell
*  was terrific the year before
*  and it's 50% worse the next year.
*  That's a really bad sign.
*  That's a bad sign.
*  And so what we're talking about
*  is something completely noninvasive
*  and could be relatively pleasant to innocuous,
*  depending on the odors used.
*  So yeah, so first I can answer that, right?
*  And the reason that that's not happened,
*  and that may be changing right now,
*  but the reason that has not happened
*  is because olfaction has not been effectively digitized.
*  If you need to generate really precise visual information,
*  you can buy a monitor for 100 bucks
*  that is at the resolution of the visual system, basically.
*  And if you wanna generate auditory stimuli
*  really precisely, then you can buy an amplifier
*  for maybe a bit more than 100 bucks,
*  but not that much more.
*  And you'll be at the resolution of the auditory system.
*  In our lab, we build devices that generate odors.
*  We call them olfactometers, which is a misnomer
*  because they don't measure anything,
*  but that's what they've always been called.
*  So we call them olfactometers as well.
*  And we've already built at least one olfactometer
*  that cost a quarter of a million euro, and it's pathetic.
*  So it's pathetic.
*  It's slow, it's contaminated.
*  It's nowhere near the resolution of your system.
*  So one of the reasons that's not happened
*  is just the utterly poor control of the stimulus.
*  Mind you, to some extent, it has happened
*  in that there are standard clinical tests of olfaction,
*  basically two that sort of control the world in this respect.
*  The older one is a test called the UPSIT,
*  which stands for the University of Pennsylvania
*  Smell Identification Test.
*  It was developed by Richard Doty and Penn.
*  And it's a test where you scratch and sniff,
*  and it's a four-alternative forced choice test
*  with 40 odorants.
*  So you have these 40 pages that you page through,
*  and you sniff and smell,
*  and it's been normed on gazillions of tests.
*  I'm always amused by it because,
*  so Richard Doty made a ton of money on the UPSIT,
*  but he needed it because he has a habit.
*  He has a NASCAR.
*  So every time we buy UPSITs in the lab,
*  I say there's another gallon of gas into Richard Doty.
*  He races NASCAR.
*  Not like NASCAR, but one lower than that.
*  I don't know, some sort of Formula A or Formula Ford,
*  he races a car.
*  And so that's where all the UPSITs went.
*  So I always feel good about buying UPSITs
*  because I know they're going to that good cause.
*  Keeping him in the fast lane.
*  So that's one test that's out there,
*  and indeed has been shown.
*  So there's reduced UPSIT in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's
*  and in a host of other diseases.
*  And there's a European version called sniffing sticks
*  that Thomas Hummel has developed.
*  And it's basically the same sort of concept of,
*  that one isn't scratch and sniff.
*  It's like these pens that you open up and sniff.
*  But those exist, but they're not as convenient
*  as delivering stimuli and vision and audition.
*  And that's why you don't have what you've just suggested.
*  Another place where you don't have it,
*  which I think would have been even more meaningful,
*  of action is not tested in newborns,
*  where vision and audition is.
*  There's this thing called congenital anosmia,
*  which is being without the sense of smell from birth,
*  supposedly congenital,
*  which is a half a percent of the population.
*  It's not a trivial number.
*  Not totally, yeah.
*  But nobody knows if that really is true.
*  Because here's an amazing factoid.
*  Guess the average age at which congenital anosmia
*  is diagnosed.
*  And this is a horrible statistic for me
*  for the way I see the world.
*  But what do you think the average age of diagnosis is
*  for congenital anosmia?
*  Five years of age.
*  14.
*  Incredible.
*  14.
*  So most people who are one half of a one percent
*  of the human population, presumably,
*  is without the sense of smell
*  and doesn't realize that until they're 14 years old.
*  Well, I don't know when they realized it first,
*  but it's formally diagnosed at 14 on average,
*  which means some of them even later, right?
*  And, right, so distribution.
*  What, do they suffer?
*  Yes.
*  So first of all, they suffer socially.
*  And there's a host of deleterious life events
*  associated with congenital anosmia.
*  They die younger.
*  So this is work out of Ilona Croy in Germany.
*  And amongst the various things that are predicted
*  by anosmia is shorter lifespan.
*  But things like reduced social contacts,
*  reduced romantic social contacts, it's not a good thing.
*  And do they lack olfactory bulbs?
*  I'm presuming they have noses and nostrils.
*  There is a condition I'm aware of where children
*  are born without noses and nostrils.
*  Very rare.
*  Very rare.
*  We don't focus on that because it's exceedingly rare.
*  But they're born with noses and nostrils.
*  And here's the thing, right?
*  We don't know if they're born with olfactory bulbs.
*  Most of them, although not all of them,
*  but most of them don't have olfactory bulbs in adulthood.
*  Or I should rephrase that, have remnant olfactory bulbs,
*  really shriveled olfactory bulbs.
*  But nobody can say the cause and effect here.
*  Before we talk about the role of the requirement
*  for olfactory bulbs for olfaction,
*  a very interesting topic in its own right,
*  I'm curious as to whether or not
*  their endocrine system is altered.
*  Because as we'll soon talk about,
*  there's a lot of signaling through the nose
*  between individuals that triggers things,
*  everything from the onset of puberty
*  to feelings of romantic attraction, attachment,
*  these sorts of things.
*  Is it known whether or not,
*  and I should say, excuse me for interrupting myself,
*  but as long as I'm interrupting you every five minutes,
*  I might as well interrupt myself too,
*  that we are well aware of the proximity
*  of the olfactory system to some of the hypothalamic systems
*  that regulate the release of gonadotropins,
*  which control testosterone and estrogen production, et cetera.
*  So are they hormonally normal?
*  So some are and some aren't, and I'll be specific.
*  So there is a condition known as Kalman syndrome,
*  which is hypogonadic development in men.
*  And in Kalman syndrome, they're practically all anosmic.
*  So to answer your question, yes, there's a direct link,
*  and it materializes in Kalman syndrome.
*  That said, not all congenitally anosmic individuals
*  have Kalman syndrome, and not all,
*  but almost all people who have Kalman syndrome are anosmic.
*  So Kalman syndrome goes with anosmia.
*  So there's a female equivalent of Kalmans,
*  or I don't remember its name.
*  It's not in the Turner syndrome family.
*  I'm not sure.
*  And I think it's also associated with anosmia,
*  but I'm not confident of that.
*  But Kalmans is associated with anosmia.
*  So the answer is yes.
*  And we can maybe, olfaction and reproduction
*  are tightly linked.
*  And they're tightly linked in all mammals,
*  and we are big terrestrial mammals,
*  and olfaction and reproduction are linked in humans as well.
*  Yeah, we will definitely get into that.
*  I'd like to just take a brief moment
*  and thank one of our podcast sponsors,
*  which is InsideTracker.
*  InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
*  that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
*  to help you better understand your body
*  and help you reach your health goals.
*  I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
*  for the simple reason that blood work is the only way
*  that you can monitor the markers, such as hormone markers,
*  lipids, metabolic factors, et cetera,
*  the impact your immediate and long-term health.
*  One major challenge with blood work, however,
*  is that most of the time,
*  it does not come back with any information about what to do
*  in order to move the values for hormones,
*  metabolic factors, lipids, et cetera,
*  into the ranges that you want.
*  With InsideTracker,
*  changing those values becomes very straightforward
*  because it has a personalized dashboard that you can use
*  to address the nutrition-based, behavior-based,
*  supplement-based approaches that you can use
*  in order to move those values into the ranges
*  that are optimal for you, your vitality,
*  and your longevity.
*  InsideTracker now includes a measurement
*  of apolipoprotein B, so-called APO-B,
*  in their ultimate plan.
*  APO-B is a key marker of cardiovascular health,
*  and therefore, there's extreme value
*  to knowing your APO-B levels.
*  If you'd like to try InsideTracker,

*  Again, that's insidetracker.com slash Huberman
*  to get 20% off.
*  I have a story slash question
*  that I'd like to tell you, ask you, as a segue to that,
*  noting, of course, that we'll get back to the requirement
*  for olfactory bulbs, yes or no, for olfaction.
*  And this relates to when I was growing up,
*  I grew up at the end of a street
*  with a lot of boys of my age,
*  who just by coincidence had a lot of older sisters,
*  they were my older sister's age.
*  It was fortunate, so I had a lot of kids to play with.
*  We would hang out at each other's houses,
*  bike, build jumps, and do all these things
*  like kid stuff, fort stuff,
*  get into trouble or whatnot.
*  And oftentimes, we would end up leaving our articles
*  of clothing at each other's houses all the time,
*  like t-shirts and jackets.
*  And so, my mom was constantly coming in and saying,
*  there's this clothes, someone left this here,
*  I don't know who it was, we were all more or less
*  the same size.
*  And from as far back as I could remember,
*  six, seven years old and onward,
*  I could pick up a shirt or a jacket, smell it,
*  and say, oh, well, that's Eric Eisenhart's shirt,
*  a friend of mine there, I just gave his name,
*  or, oh, that's Scott Madsen's shirt.
*  I could just smell the shirt and in a conscious way
*  know who it belonged to, having never, I promise,
*  not that I would pretend I hadn't if I had,
*  but having never actually done the exercise
*  of going and smelling my friend intentionally.
*  Right.
*  Okay, in fact, if anything, I had all the reasons
*  in the world to avoid smelling the other young boys
*  in my neighborhood.
*  Okay, so that raises the question of whether or not
*  we are consciously and or subconsciously
*  coding identification of people that we interact with
*  frequently or infrequently in terms of their smell
*  or some other aspect of their chemistry.
*  Yeah.
*  So, yes.
*  We're doing that all the time in my view,
*  and a lot of this processing, almost all of it,
*  is subconscious, and I don't know why.
*  I already put that out there, right?
*  I have no idea why human nature has,
*  or nature or culture or whatnot has pushed this
*  into the realm of subconscious
*  and something we're unaware of.
*  But we do it all the time,
*  and our lab has lots of studies on this front.
*  One of them you may be familiar with that had gained
*  some notoriety because it's amusing.
*  So we look at human behavior a lot.
*  We try to look at it through our nose
*  and the way we look at what people are doing.
*  We try to think, if I was a dog,
*  what would I think of this?
*  If you look at dogs, when they interact,
*  they visibly sniff each other.
*  It's very obvious.
*  They walk up to each other and they sniff each other.
*  And yet, humans don't typically walk up to a stranger
*  and carefully sniff them, right?
*  I mean, we're sort of obliged to sniff our babies.
*  That's considered almost something you're supposed to do.
*  And it's not culturally taboo to sniff our loved ones.
*  It sort of doesn't seem like an odd thing to do.
*  But we don't sniff strangers, right?
*  Well, or do we?
*  So we're finding more and more mechanisms
*  where we do this.
*  And the one I'm referring to now, for one example,
*  is we started looking at handshaking.
*  Handshaking is this really odd behavior.
*  And it's not only in the West, by the way.
*  Some people think it's only a Western thing.
*  It's not.
*  It's almost everywhere.
*  And there's really poor understanding
*  of how this behavior evolved.
*  Like, where did this thing come from?
*  So if you look for the Wikipedia version, right,
*  then they'll tell you that it's to show
*  that you're not holding a weapon in your hand.
*  But there's really no good evidence for that.
*  It's a bit like the Trillium bloodhound receptor story,
*  right?
*  I mean, we tried to find it.
*  Why do people say that?
*  They just do.
*  And we started looking at people handshaking.
*  And we noticed, or it seemed to us,
*  that we're noticing that people will shake hands
*  and then go like this and like this.
*  For those of you listening, not watching,
*  Gnome is taking his hand and wiping it on his face.
*  Grabbing his nose or touching the side of his cheek.
*  These things that we do all the time.
*  After a handshake.
*  Well, so first of all,
*  we do them all the time just period, right?
*  The baseline here is really high
*  and we'll get to that in a second.
*  But these behaviors that you could easily not notice, right?
*  And so we asked whether that's a real thing.
*  And this was a study led by Dan Froome in our lab at the time.
*  And what we did first,
*  and if you want, we can link.
*  So this was published in eLife.
*  And one of the nice things about eLife
*  is that it has a very effective way
*  to embed videos in the publication.
*  So if you want, we can link this to your system later on.
*  The eLife.
*  Put it in the show note captions as a link on YouTube
*  and the other four platforms, Spotify, Apple.
*  So what we did is we brought in participants to our lab
*  and we sat them in the room, experiment room,
*  and told them the experiment would start soon
*  and they should wait for us there.
*  They didn't know what they were coming from.
*  Unbeknownst to them, they were already being videoed.
*  Of course, later on, they had the opportunity
*  to not agree to us saving the video,
*  in which case we would delete it immediately
*  or letting us use it for science
*  or some letting us use it for more than science
*  for the video that's now on eLife.
*  And we walk into the room and say, okay, just wait here.
*  We'll be right back with you to set up our experiment.
*  And they would sit there for three minutes.
*  And during those three minutes,
*  we could later quantify how much indeed they,
*  just by baseline, how much they touch their nose
*  or their forehead or their chin
*  or how many times their hand reaches their face.
*  And by the way, that baseline is not low.
*  Okay?
*  And then three minutes later,
*  an experimenter would walk into the room
*  and would share a consistent text.
*  It would be, you know, we're still setting up our equipment
*  in the other room.
*  And so just wait here and we'll be right back with you.
*  But in the meantime, just wait here.
*  And the experimenter went through this
*  like 20 second fixed text.
*  And in half of the cases, it included a handshake.
*  This was a new experimenter,
*  not the one who put them in the room.
*  So that's the first time they met.
*  So it'd be a little, I'm, you know, so and so,
*  they would put out their hand and shake their hand or not.
*  Okay?
*  And we did all possible interactions in terms of gender.
*  So we matched male participants
*  with male and female experimenters
*  and female participants with female and male experimenters.
*  And so you had handshake and no handshake conditions.
*  And then you can quantify that behavior
*  of the hand going to the nose after handshake.
*  And there was a remarkable increase
*  in the hand going to the nose after handshake.
*  And this is one of the nice cases we,
*  the paper includes statistics,
*  but you don't need statistics here.
*  Just look at the video.
*  It's unreal.
*  The video is unreal.
*  So interesting.
*  So the hand goes to the nose.
*  Now we did a few controls here to verify
*  that this is an olfactory behavior.
*  One is unbeknownst to participants,
*  we measured nasal airflow
*  and people not only bring their hand to their nose,
*  they sniff it.
*  So, and this is perfectly time.
*  They go like this.
*  Okay. So they're sniffing their hands.
*  And in an additional control study, we manipulated it.
*  So we built this little James Bond thing
*  of a watch on the experimenter's hand
*  that could emit an odor.
*  And the experimenter didn't know what odor they were emitting
*  and they could emit either a pleasant
*  or an unpleasant odor.
*  And we could drive the self sampling afterwards up or down.
*  So this was an olfactory behavior, no doubt about it.
*  I mean, we're quite confident.
*  So people in that case,
*  people must have been sensing the odor on their own hand
*  because they shook the hand of the experimenter,
*  pleasant odor, and they're more frequently bringing
*  that hand to their nose versus unpleasant odor
*  that had been introduced to their own hand
*  by the experimenter.
*  Yeah, but no, I think they were sensing the ambient odor
*  that came in with the hand that shook.
*  And then that either drove them
*  to sniff their hands more or less.
*  The odor cloud of the experimenter.
*  Yeah, and there's an interesting thing going on here too,
*  because people didn't only smell the hand that shook,
*  they also smelled the other hand.
*  And we think that there's something going on here
*  comparing self to other.
*  And we think a lot of self sampling might reflect that.
*  There's on the same line, and again,
*  to link to your childhood story
*  of identifying your friends by smell.
*  A study we published just last year
*  by Nibali Ravrebi in our lab,
*  where Nibali came with this basic interest
*  in this phenomenon that's loosely referred to
*  as click friendships.
*  So people you meet and you click right away, right?
*  You immediately become close friends.
*  And this is a phenomenon that is poorly described
*  or is poorly described in literature as an entity,
*  and yet anybody will tell you
*  they know what you're talking about, right?
*  I mean, if you tell,
*  if somebody you click with right away,
*  you become intimate within five minutes, right?
*  Everybody experienced this in their life to some extent.
*  And the question is, what was there, right?
*  What was it?
*  Was it because you looked the same?
*  Could it be, was it because you had the same sports team
*  that you liked or is there something deeper here?
*  And Nibali's theory was that a similarity in body odor
*  may contribute to this,
*  that people who smell the same will click in some way.
*  And so to address that,
*  she actually recruited click friends from all over Israel.
*  She posted all over social media
*  to identify pairs of friends.
*  So these are same-sex, non-romantic dyads.
*  So these are friends, men and women,
*  whose friendship started as a click,
*  where here this becomes sensitive
*  because it has to be a mutual click, right?
*  Later on we discovered there could be one-sided clicks.
*  So somebody is sure they clicked with somebody else,
*  but the other person.
*  There's a name for that in neurology
*  that our common friend, the late Ben Barris taught me,
*  which is there's a phrase that neurologists use
*  called sticky.
*  These are people that come up to you
*  and start asking you questions
*  and then won't leave you alone.
*  They're so-called sticky people.
*  And if you ask these sticky people,
*  sticky in air quotes,
*  because they're not physically sticky.
*  They may be.
*  They could be.
*  What do you think of this person?
*  They'll say, oh, they're great.
*  We're really good friends.
*  And so they've made a unilateral click friendship.
*  And yes, neurologists are talking about you.
*  If you're one of these people,
*  neurologists are talking about you.
*  There's an informal diagnostic code, sticky.
*  She recruited click friends
*  and then she sampled their body odor.
*  And we have a protocol for this.
*  They're given odorless shampoo and soap
*  to use for three weeks or something.
*  And then they sleep two nights in this T-shirt
*  where they have to sleep alone.
*  And then we extract the body odor from the T-shirt.
*  And so we have a method to extract body odor.
*  And then she first asked whether indeed
*  click friends are more similar in their body odor
*  than you would expect by chance.
*  And she first tested this with a device,
*  a machine we call an electronic nose.
*  So an electronic nose is sort of a very poor effort
*  to mimic what the mammalian nose does.
*  Basically, it's a bunch of sensors
*  that respond to airborne molecules.
*  In this case, sensors referred to as MOXERS,
*  as metal oxide covered sensors.
*  And so she used an electronic nose
*  to sample these body odors.
*  And she found that click friends
*  are indeed more similar to each other
*  than you would expect by chance, by random dyads.
*  And this was a significant difference.
*  And after she found that a device could do this,
*  she had other participants do this.
*  So she had people smelling the click friends
*  versus non-click friends, and they judged them
*  as being more similar to each other than not.
*  Now, again, you might wonder, is this causal or not right?
*  Because maybe click friends go to the same restaurant together
*  all the time or whatever, live in the same neighborhood,
*  and that's why they smell the same.
*  So to address causality, she recruited total strangers
*  and first smelled them with the electronic nose,
*  and then engaged them in a social interaction,
*  something called the mirror game.
*  So in the mirror game, one person moves their hands
*  and the other person is really close to them,
*  like right here, so they can smell each other,
*  and has to move their hands with the other person.
*  And one prediction there panned out, but another didn't.
*  The one that didn't, so she predicted
*  that people would smell more similar to each other
*  would be better at the mirror game,
*  that is they would follow each other better.
*  That did not pan out.
*  However, she then also had,
*  the interaction was completely nonverbal,
*  they were not allowed to speak with each other,
*  and she did an entire round robin,
*  so everybody played with everybody else.
*  This was an insane experiment to run.
*  And she then, at the end of the experiment,
*  each person rated each other person
*  as to how much they think they would wanna be their friends,
*  and also on a bunch of ratings, how nice they think they are,
*  how affectionate they think, a bunch of ratings, okay?
*  All of this was predicted by the electronic nose.
*  So people who smell more similar to each other
*  think that the other person is more likely
*  to be their friend, is more likely to be a nice person,
*  et cetera, et cetera.
*  So we could actually predict friendship
*  using the electronic nose.
*  So this is not a result of friendship.
*  It plays into the causal elements of building friendship.
*  So this is to relate to your childhood story.
*  There's something going on here.
*  We're constantly smelling ourselves, constantly.
*  This constantly, I mean, if you wanna link,
*  the reason I'm smiling, I mean,
*  and your viewers or listeners will understand
*  why I'm smiling, I'll send you a video to link
*  in the, into your podcast here.
*  We thought of calling,
*  the fact that people constantly sniff themselves,
*  we thought of calling this the low effect.
*  And low, so in America, this won't pass that effectively,
*  but in the rest of the normal world,
*  Joachim Loh is the soccer, the national soccer coach
*  of the German soccer team.
*  So, I mean, I don't know who would be a very famous coach
*  here, but Steve Kerr, I mean, this is the, you know,
*  this is a super, super famous name all around the world
*  where soccer is the primary sport that people watch.
*  And once people will see this video,
*  they'll understand why we thought of calling this
*  the low effect.
*  It's a very graphic.
*  But people are constantly smelling themselves.
*  They're smelling themselves with their hands,
*  they're smelling themselves explicitly.
*  People are constantly smelling themselves,
*  constantly smelling others.
*  I find this topic so interesting.
*  And first of all, confession, I definitely smell myself
*  multiple times per day.
*  Everybody does.
*  Okay, good.
*  Well, then I would do it anyway.
*  I think I, like most people,
*  I either find my own smell to be neutral to pleasant.
*  Right?
*  Occasionally I'll be like, whoa, I need to take a shower.
*  As long as we're talking about smelling oneself
*  and friendship, kinship and its relationship to smell,
*  we have to talk about the relationship between smell
*  and romantic attraction and bond.
*  So my understanding is that if, for instance,
*  a mouse is given the option to mate with any number
*  of other different mice,
*  they will bias their choice toward the mouse
*  that has the immune composition, the so-called MHC,
*  major histocommatability complex,
*  which reflects immune diversity,
*  the immune system that is most distant from theirs.
*  And the evolutionary argument being that were they
*  to produce offspring, that the array of immune genes
*  would be much broader than if they were to select
*  an animal very close to them.
*  And in addition to that,
*  that one of the most strongly selected against behaviors,
*  not just culturally, but at the level of eliciting
*  a sense of disgust, maybe even from the activity
*  of the hypothalamus, is mating with very close kin,
*  aka incest, because that can potentially,
*  we know produces a higher rate of mutations.
*  In other words, whereas you described the relationship
*  between smell and choice of friends as you choose people
*  who smell more like you,
*  my understanding is that in the context of
*  choosing romantic partners or sexual partners or both,
*  that you choose the person whose odor
*  and therefore immune composition is most different.
*  Right, so the way you describe the animal literature
*  is correct, and there's evidence
*  to similar mechanisms in humans.
*  Our lab has not worked directly on this issue
*  of romantic selection based on odor.
*  There's a bunch of papers,
*  Wedkind et al. and the Wedkind Lab,
*  and also Porter, I'll email these to you later on,
*  that have done a lot of this work
*  and find exactly as you say that
*  romantic odor preferences in humans
*  are influenced by body odor,
*  and that this is linked to MHC,
*  histocompatibility complex makeup
*  of the portion of our genome
*  that shapes our immune system to some extent.
*  So this effect has been studied and reported on,
*  again, extensively in mice and also in humans,
*  not work that we've done.
*  So the one sort of tangent work we've done,
*  and I'd like to maybe tell you about,
*  it relates to an effect
*  that is one of the most remarkable effects
*  in mammalian social chemo signaling.
*  So, and also related to,
*  so it's not related to romanticism in any way,
*  but it's related to reproduction.
*  And indeed in our lab, we've not looked at romanticism,
*  we have looked at, or are looking at reproduction.
*  They're not always the same.
*  Certainly.
*  But they can.
*  Animal mammalian or terrestrial mammalian
*  reproductive behavior is dominated
*  by the sense of smell in mammals.
*  And here, remember initially when you started off,
*  I noted that there are several subsystems in our nose
*  that transduce odorants,
*  and so primarily the main olfactory system,
*  which is cranial nerve number one,
*  and the trigeminal nerve, which is cranial nerve number five.
*  Most terrestrial mammals have another subsystem
*  referred to as the secondary olfactory system
*  that has a separate sense organ in the nose.
*  This organ is known as the vomeronasal organ.
*  It's a small pit in the nasal passage
*  of most terrestrial mammals.
*  Sometimes it's described as a communicating pit
*  because sometimes it connects the nasal passage
*  to the roof of the mouth.
*  Sometimes it connects both.
*  And so there's the sense organ
*  with its specific receptor subtypes,
*  VNRs, vomeronasal receptors.
*  And this is linked to a sort of separate portion
*  of the olfactory bulb,
*  not really the main olfactory bulb,
*  although it's referred to as the accessory olfactory bulb.
*  And from there directly to the limbic system,
*  to the portions of the brain
*  that control reproductive behavior and aggressive behavior.
*  And in most terrestrial mammals,
*  this subsystem processes odorants
*  that are sometimes referred to as pheromones,
*  although that's in many ways a problematic term,
*  but odorants that are referred to as pheromones,
*  namely odorants that are emitted
*  by another member of the species
*  to influence that member of the species
*  and alter behavior or hormonal state.
*  And some of these hormonal effects are utterly remarkable.
*  And in my view, the most remarkable of all
*  is an effect known as the Bruce effect.
*  This was an effect discovered by Margaret Bruce in 1959.
*  She was a British scientist.
*  And in the Bruce effect,
*  when you expose a pregnant mouse
*  at an early critical stage of the pregnancy,
*  I think up to about day three,
*  if you expose the pregnant mouse
*  to the odor of what is referred to in technical terms
*  as the non-stud male,
*  that is a male who did not father the pregnancy,
*  she will miscarry the pregnancy.
*  She will abort it.
*  Now that's an insane decision made by the female here,
*  because she's invested quite a lot in this.
*  In biological terms and in forming this pregnancy
*  and maintaining it.
*  And yet she drops it on the basis of an odor.
*  And this effect is remarkably robust.
*  And what do I mean by remarkably robust?
*  So this will occur on about 80% of exposures.
*  Now as you know, 80% is 100% in biology, right?
*  I mean, there's nothing that happens at more than 80%.
*  So it's a remarkably robust effect.
*  So we know this dropping of the pregnancy.
*  And we know it's mediated by chemo sensation
*  through the nose. We know for sure.
*  And we know in the following way.
*  So first, it's enough to just bring the odor
*  of the non-stud male.
*  You don't have to bring the male himself, right?
*  So you just can bring bedding from a non-stud male
*  and that will induce the Bruce effect.
*  But of course, the most telling set of experiments
*  is that if in the female mouse,
*  you ablate the vomeronasal organ,
*  you just burn this tiny structure in the nose,
*  then the effect disappears.
*  So the effect is completely dependent
*  on the vomeronasal organ.
*  And I find this odor remarkably remarkable effect, right?
*  I mean, because again, because of the extent of cost
*  that the female takes on here,
*  based on this information and smell.
*  Now, humans,
*  the sort of the going notion in all fashion
*  is that humans don't have a functional vomeronasal organ.
*  So we don't have that functional organ in our nose.
*  Now I'll point out, we actually do have the pit.
*  So the structure or the outlining structure is there.
*  But the pit that we have is considered vestigial
*  and non-functional.
*  And what about this thing I learned about at Berkeley
*  in integrative biology class
*  that we have something called Jacobson's organ?
*  This is the same organ.
*  So Jacobson's organ is the vomeronasal organ.
*  It's also called Jacobson because I think Jacobson
*  was a military physician in like the 1800s
*  in Holland or something.
*  And he founded in a soldier he was operating on
*  or something like that.
*  The story comes from something like that.
*  But Jacobson's organ is another name
*  for the vomeronasal organ.
*  These are one in the same,
*  the sensory organ of the accessory olfactory system.
*  And again, the going notion is that the human Jacobson organ
*  or vomeronasal organ is vestigial.
*  It's non-functional.
*  Does that necessarily mean
*  that we don't have these pheromone effects?
*  No, it does not.
*  So first of all, we know that lots of
*  what are considered pheromonal effects,
*  namely social chemosygonal rodents
*  are mediated by the main olfactory system.
*  We know that for sure.
*  There are several examples for this in mice and rats
*  and rabbits and so on and so forth.
*  So A, these can be mediated by the main olfactory system.
*  And I'll come back to that in a second,
*  but first to finish the Bruce effect.
*  And second, and I'm going out on a limb here,
*  but I'm willing to take that risk.
*  For me, the jury is still out on human vomeronasal.
*  And so I'm going to go back to the
*  post-mortem organ and I'm going to talk about
*  the post-mortem organ.
*  The decision or the notion that it's non-functional
*  relies on about one and a half papers,
*  post-mortem, looking for the nerve
*  that connects this thing to the brain
*  and failing to find it,
*  using staining and so on and so forth.
*  But staining post-mortem studies in humans
*  are notoriously complicated.
*  And the study that the brain has just always
*  has gone through, it's not ideally set
*  as it is when you sacrifice an animal
*  and study its tissue.
*  So based on really, really a paucity of studies
*  that fail to find this nerve,
*  the notion is that the structure is vestigial in humans.
*  But I'm just not sure that it's not.
*  But what we do have a suspicion
*  is that humans may experience something similar
*  to a Bruce effect.
*  So first of all, humans have an enormous number
*  or ratio of spontaneous miscarriage.
*  Are they occurring more often in the first trimester?
*  Because you mentioned that in the
*  Bruce effect in the mice is in the first three days
*  or so following pregnancy, which in the mouse gestation,
*  as I recall, is about 21 days in the mouse.
*  So you're talking about one seventh of total gestation.
*  So I'm not quick enough to,
*  nor is it important to translate,
*  but this would be first trimester in humans.
*  Which is indeed when most miscarriage occurs.
*  Now, humans have, again, a huge number of miscarriages
*  and the numbers, I'll soon share them with you,
*  they sound odd.
*  And the reason they sound odd is because
*  if you have what's sometimes simply referred to
*  as failed implantation, this can occur in days one, two,
*  nobody ever knows.
*  So some papers talk about 90% of all human pregnancies
*  end in miscarriage.
*  This is counting a failed implantation in day one, two,
*  et cetera.
*  More conservative studies talk about 50%.
*  Nobody will argue 30%.
*  So a huge number, a huge number of human pregnancies
*  end in miscarriage.
*  Now, out of these, there's a portion that are unexplained.
*  So nobody knows why.
*  I mean, there are a portion that are explained,
*  but all sorts of genetic factors, developmental factors,
*  and so on and so forth.
*  But there's also a proportion that are unexplained.
*  And so all I'm saying is that there's a statistical backdrop
*  or setting, if you will, for something like
*  a remnant Bruce effect in humans.
*  Now, with that in mind, we approached a group of,
*  we enlisted a group of, they're not really patients
*  and participants in a study of people who,
*  couples who are experiencing what is referred to as
*  unexplained repeated pregnancy loss.
*  So formally, if you have two consecutive
*  unexplained miscarriages, then that is sufficient
*  for the diagnosis of unexplained repeated pregnancy loss.
*  However, in our cohort of 30, we had couples who experienced
*  12 consecutive unexplained repeated pregnancy losses.
*  So the two is just the formal.
*  All of our cohort was like 12, five.
*  So this is an emotional, difficult place to be.
*  And these are couples who are losing their pregnancy
*  for no apparent reason.
*  So they've gone through all the tests that you can imagine
*  of genetic incompatibilities and all sorts of issues,
*  clotting all the known suspects for pregnancy loss.
*  And the medical establishment remains totally at a loss
*  as to why these pregnancies aren't holding.
*  And so we hypothesized that perhaps here,
*  there's something akin to a Bruce type effect.
*  Obviously it's not gonna be the same as in mice,
*  but something like a Bruce effect.
*  Now, of course, at that stage,
*  we could not do anything causal to test this, right?
*  But what we could do is to see,
*  to seek circumstantial evidence to see if
*  where there's fire, maybe there's smoke.
*  And what we did was we tested all faction
*  and then more specifically the response to male body odor
*  in the couples experiencing repeated pregnancy loss.
*  And we found a few things.
*  First of all, if you think of the mechanisms
*  behind the Bruce effect,
*  the Bruce effect implies that the female has to have
*  a very clear memory of the fathering male
*  because if she's gonna miscarry
*  in response to the nonfather,
*  she has to know father, nonfather.
*  I mean, that means that there's a pronounced olfactory memory
*  at the moment of mating, okay?
*  And in mice, this has been very well characterized
*  and attributed to the anterior olfactory nucleus
*  structure in the brain.
*  But you'd have to have this memory
*  in order to make that decision.
*  Now, so to address that, and here you're gonna see
*  that you in your childhood story from before
*  stand out a bit as skillful,
*  is that the first thing we did was just behaviorally test
*  whether these women and control women
*  could identify the smell of their spouse.
*  And you might be disappointed or, you know,
*  are probably a bit disappointed to learn
*  that control women are very poor at this.
*  So you would think that women would be good
*  at identifying the body odor of their spouse, they're not.
*  They're not far from chance.
*  However, the women who experience repeated pregnancy loss
*  are more, they're double at their performance level.
*  So this is not a nuance effect.
*  Women who experience repeated pregnancy loss
*  can identify their husbands or their spouses
*  by their body odor.
*  With much greater acuity than the typical person?
*  Double, a bit more than double and way above chance.
*  Yeah, no, sorry, I pose as a question,
*  but I meant, yes, with much greater acuity
*  and double is a significant improvement.
*  Are they much better at detecting any odor?
*  No, they're not, we did the controls and they're not.
*  And then we also measured using fMRI,
*  we measured their brain response
*  to a stranger male body odor.
*  And this was quite remarkable because, you know,
*  we approached, so this was a full brain analysis.
*  So without a region of interest analysis,
*  so it's not as if you're tweaking your statistics
*  to look at one part of the brain.
*  You're just looking at the entire brain
*  in the response to male body odor and asking de novo,
*  is there a difference between these two groups
*  of participants?
*  And there was one huge difference
*  and it was in the hypothalamus.
*  And so there was a difference in response
*  to stranger male body odor between the two groups.
*  So olfaction is altered in spontaneous,
*  repeated spontaneous pregnancy loss.
*  We don't know this is causal, right?
*  But that was enough for us to approach the ethics committee
*  to run a causal experiment.
*  And we're at the beginning of that now.
*  Incredible, I can't wait to hear the results of that.
*  It's gonna take, it'll probably take years, a few.
*  Because these are slow experiments to run.
*  Recruitment is complicated.
*  But basically we're blocking smell
*  in couples who are trying to maintain a pregnancy.
*  I want to touch on some other so-called pheromone effects.
*  And one thing I heard you say during a talk,
*  which I think really captures this whole issue of
*  are there pheromone effects in humans?
*  Very nicely, as you said,
*  whether or not it's a classic pheromone effect
*  or whether or not it's olfaction or something else,
*  this is chemosensory signaling between individuals.
*  The reason this is important to me is a few years ago
*  I did a social media post about pheromone effects in animals
*  and some potential pheromone effects in humans.
*  And a couple of the human olfactionistas
*  more from the, actually who work on animal models,
*  really came after me with intense sniffing saying,
*  there is no evidence for human pheromone effects,
*  human pheromone organs.
*  And I think today you've beautifully illustrated
*  regardless of the answer to that,
*  humans are contained and are emitting chemical signals
*  that influence each other's physiology and behavior.
*  For sure, for sure.
*  And the term pheromone is a problematic term in any case.
*  I mean, the term was put forth
*  to describe insect behavior, right?
*  So, if you were given a hard time by the mouse people,
*  you could have given them an equally hard time
*  if you were an insect person, right?
*  Because really the place the term is accurate,
*  so the first pheromone that was discovered was bambacol,
*  which is the pheromone that has the male moth
*  follow the scent trail of the female moth.
*  Bambacol is a pheromone.
*  Insect pheromone people will argue that this stuff
*  that people talk about in mice and rats is not pheromones.
*  I see.
*  And it all becomes semantics.
*  Yeah, sort of like nerdy inside ball.
*  It's all semantics.
*  In our publications, we don't use the term pheromone
*  because it would not help me
*  and it would probably only hurt us.
*  And so, we talk about chemo signals
*  and humans definitely emit chemo signals from their body
*  and these chemo signals influence other humans
*  and influence their behavior.
*  There are several examples of this.
*  One of them I'll point out first,
*  which is sort of the most widely studied
*  and not mostly from our lab actually.
*  I mean, the flavor of the month
*  for the past 10 years in this field
*  is what's referred to as the smell of fear, right?
*  So, this is probably true of many mammals and humans.
*  It's true of we emit a specific body odor
*  when we're in a state of fear.
*  This was first discovered in humans by Denise Chen.
*  Out of, I think brown, I'm not sure.
*  I think that's right, yep.
*  Humans emit a particular body odor
*  when they're in a state of fear
*  and this body odor influences other humans,
*  in effect, increasing their autonomic arousal,
*  their sympathetic state.
*  So, in effect, you could say that fear is contagious a bit.
*  So, the smell of fear is contagious.
*  By the way, culturally, we know for ages
*  that dogs can smell fear in humans,
*  but actually that was only really shown
*  about a year and a half ago in a study.
*  So, it was always said,
*  but it wasn't really shown effectively.
*  It was shown about a year and a half ago in a study
*  that dogs indeed can smell human fear
*  and humans can smell human fear.
*  So, several labs starting from Denise Chen
*  and Haviland Jones and then in our lab and in other labs,
*  if you collect body odor from people in a state of fear
*  and collect body odor from the same people
*  when they're not in a state of fear,
*  other people can determine which is the state of fear or not
*  and this influences their behavior.
*  What about the smell of safety
*  or is that simply the absence of the odor
*  corresponding to fear?
*  And the reason I ask this is somewhat woven
*  into our prior discussion about mate choice.
*  Again, I'll ask the question in a form of brief anecdotes.
*  I'll use the I had a friend who approach here,
*  but well, one phenomenon that has nothing to do
*  with me in particular,
*  I think this is a common phenomenon is
*  romantic partners leaving articles of clothing
*  at each other's homes.
*  Now, this could have other purposes to mark territory,
*  but visually marking territory,
*  but also scent marking territory
*  is very common in the animal kingdom.
*  It's not uncommon for romantic partners
*  when one is traveling or away
*  for the other partner to smell their article of clothing
*  in order to bring about positive connotations
*  of the other partner, very common behavior.
*  If you're doing this, folks,
*  other people are doing this too.
*  It raises questions, for instance,
*  about whether or not the mourning period post breakup,
*  whether by decision, by death,
*  or by some other phenomenon that's forced the breakup,
*  whether or not that mourning period has something to do
*  with an olfactory unlearning of,
*  and mate selection, and on, and on, and on.
*  With all these insights,
*  I would offer you to be a postdoc.
*  Well, I was gonna say,
*  listen, I have a sabbatical coming up,
*  so I would love to do a sabbatical.
*  But it's gonna kill me.
*  No, exactly.
*  You don't want me to work for you.
*  We talked about this earlier.
*  That's what I'm saying.
*  For other reasons, exactly.
*  There's a story there, what Noma's referring to,
*  I'll just tell people,
*  because inside jokes on the podcast don't really work.
*  Earlier, I was afraid, in fact,
*  that I've had three incredible scientific mentors,
*  undergraduate, graduate, and postdoc,
*  but for reasons that are unclear to me,
*  the first one died of suicide,
*  the second one cancer at 50,
*  and the third one pancreatic cancer in his early 60s,
*  and the last one before he died,
*  who was an MD and a common friend of Noma's,
*  and I turned to me and said,
*  Andrew, you're the common denominator.
*  So the joke in my business is,
*  you don't want me to work for you.
*  So nonetheless, I would love to do a sabbatical
*  in your lab.
*  So what I was trying to say in that roundabout way
*  is that those are all really keen observations
*  and good ideas, for sure.
*  And they just highlight, again,
*  that we're incredibly olfactory animals.
*  And you're even talking about the nuance.
*  We're very olfactory, even not in the nuance.
*  I mean, I have this, when people tell me
*  that we don't use our sense of smell
*  and we don't need it and all that,
*  and I have to deal with this a lot, right?
*  I have to deal a lot.
*  You study vision, nobody will tell you
*  that vision is unimportant, right?
*  I have to-
*  We're very visually dependent.
*  I don't need a dog to take over my olfactory system
*  if I lose olfaction,
*  but I'll tell you, from having lost my sense of smell
*  for one day, I was in intense fear.
*  I bit into blueberries.
*  I love blueberries.
*  I'm like a drive-by blueberry eater.
*  If they're there, I just kind of pick them up
*  like a grizzly bear and cram them in my mouth.
*  So keep them away from me if you don't want them eaten.
*  But I almost can't help myself.
*  I bit into a blueberry or a handful of blueberries
*  and it was the sensation of little bags of water.
*  And I immediately felt a tremendous grief.
*  I'll tell you a sort of a throwaway line
*  that I use in this one when I talk with people.
*  I mean, take the two most basic behaviors
*  that sustain us, right?
*  Let's say I give you a choice
*  between a beautiful looking layer cake
*  with strawberries and blueberries and whipped cream,
*  but that smells of sewage
*  versus some gray-brown mix that smells of cinnamon.
*  Which do we eat?
*  Simple, the latter.
*  Right, you eat the latter, right?
*  Now imagine I offer you a mate.
*  Choose the gender of your liking, right?
*  That looks like a Greek god or goddess, right?
*  But smells of sewage.
*  Or an ordinary looking individual that smells of sin itself.
*  Who do you choose?
*  The latter.
*  Right, so in the two most basic behaviors we have,
*  we follow our nose, not our eyes, right?
*  Definitely not always in predictable ways
*  because you offered an extreme example,
*  which is the best example.
*  But I, for instance, for reasons I don't know,
*  I've never liked the smell of perfume, ever.
*  In fact, I find it aversive.
*  But I do, I confess, I do like the smell
*  of certain body odors very much.
*  And I'm very particular about that.
*  And I know within an instant.
*  And so this is a problem for any romantic partner
*  who likes perfume, for me.
*  But I know many people like perfumes and colognes
*  and things of that sort.
*  I like perfume.
*  And in fairness, I've also been told that by someone
*  that they couldn't spend time with me
*  because they do not like my smell.
*  In fact, they dislike it.
*  And fortunately for me, there's at least one person
*  on the planet who said the opposite.
*  So I completely agree with what you're saying.
*  I can also say that I imprinted on the smell of,
*  I had a bulldog mastiff that I raised
*  from the time he was a puppy.
*  And I imprinted on, I imprinted on his smell immediately.
*  And even though to other people,
*  he was a bulldog mastiff after all,
*  his smell was rather aversive.
*  To me, he smelled delicious, right?
*  And it made me think, it smelled like home.
*  And he was my best animal friend for a long time.
*  So and on and on and on, right?
*  The smell of children, as you said, the backs,
*  we had a guest on this podcast,
*  who I'm sure you're familiar with, Charles Zucker,
*  a professor at Columbia has done incredible work
*  in vision and old-fashioned, thirst sensing.
*  And he, and I talked a little bit about this,
*  that there's something in the breath of romantic partners
*  that's hopefully appetitive, not aversive,
*  as well as in children, he was talking about the smell
*  of his grandchild's, the nape of their,
*  the back of their neck and how he misses that smell
*  because when he thinks about missing his grandchild
*  or children, it's that smell that's associated
*  with that feeling.
*  Hexadecanal.
*  Hexadecanal?
*  Yes.
*  Charles, your grandchildren smell like hexadecanal.
*  Yes, they do.
*  He's gonna come after me now.
*  They do, and so this is a study ran by Eva Michaur,
*  who was a graduate student in our lab.
*  And Eva was interested in aggression.
*  She was really into aggression.
*  And actually when she started off, we said,
*  okay, let's do chemo signaling of aggression.
*  She actually was going to like MMA clubs
*  and collecting body odors.
*  And we had all sorts of ideas going
*  and she worked on that for quite a bit.
*  It never went anywhere really.
*  And then at the same time,
*  we had a colleague of ours from Germany.
*  I mean, when I say colleague, primarily a friend
*  or acquaintance I met at conferences, Heinz Breer.
*  And he was studying in his lab
*  a molecule, hexadecanal, that was a chemo signal in mice,
*  where in mice it was described as a chemo signal
*  that promotes social buffering.
*  Where social buffering, as far as I understand,
*  it's not my field, but as far as I understand,
*  it's basically a feel good together thing.
*  So when lots of mice are together,
*  they feel good about being in a group
*  and that's social buffering.
*  And it's promoted by hexadecanal,
*  which they emit in their feces, mice.
*  And in his work on hexadecanal,
*  and so Breer and his colleague Stortzman,
*  they discovered the receptor for this.
*  And then they went and discovered
*  that the receptor is very highly conserved
*  throughout mammalian evolution.
*  And therefore they hypothesized that maybe
*  this is a universal mammalian signal.
*  Now, which is unusual because in chemo signaling,
*  typically you tend to think of things
*  as being very species specific.
*  But here they hypothesized that maybe hexadecanal,
*  which promotes social buffering in mice,
*  may do something in all mammals.
*  Again, because this receptor is very highly conserved,
*  OR37B, I think.
*  So he approached us and said,
*  look, you've got to study this stuff in humans, right?
*  Because he knows us as the human people, right?
*  I mean, we go to these all-faction conferences
*  where lots of people study this stuff.
*  Lots of people study mice and zebrafish and whatnot,
*  and we're the human group.
*  And eventually he just FedExed us, hexadecanal.
*  And so we had this thing sitting around,
*  and Eva was not going anywhere with her aggression studies
*  with sweat from human participants.
*  And yet she built the entire paradigm
*  to study human aggression.
*  So there are standard paradigms.
*  This is a paradigm known as the TAP,
*  the Tyler Aggression Paradigm.
*  I'll soon describe it.
*  And so we said, okay, we have this hexadecanal stuff here
*  and it promotes social buffering.
*  Social buffering sounds like it would make you less aggressive.
*  Why don't you run your TAP experiment using hexadecanal?
*  What's the TAP experiment?
*  So basically what you do is you bring in a participant to lab
*  and you have them thinking
*  that they're gonna be playing against another person
*  in this game.
*  And you can do something like have another person
*  walk into the other room playing online, so connect it.
*  So you can fool them into being quite convinced
*  that this is what's happening.
*  And they go into their own room.
*  And in the initial game they play,
*  on each round they're provided with a sum of money.
*  And this is real money that they'll receive
*  at the end of the experiment.
*  And by turn, each one of them decides
*  how to divide the money up between the two.
*  So they're playing against another person, they think,
*  but that's actually a computer algorithm
*  that they're playing against.
*  And the computer algorithm is programmed
*  to be in scientific terminology a jerk.
*  So let's say they have to divvy up 100 Chekel,
*  which is the Israeli currency.
*  So the other player would say, okay, I'll keep 96
*  and you get four, right?
*  And then you can either accept it or not accept it
*  and then neither of you get anything, right?
*  So basically you're being shafted
*  by the other side all the time.
*  And this is called the provocation phase.
*  You're really getting angry at this person
*  because they're really not nice, right?
*  They're shafting you on every trial, almost.
*  And you play this game and it goes to its end.
*  And then you play a second game,
*  as far as you know, against the same participant.
*  And the second game is a reaction time game.
*  So a target shows up and the first to press it wins.
*  And on every trial where you win,
*  if you want you can blast the other participant
*  with a loud noise.
*  And it's a really loud noise.
*  So you're also wearing earphones, it's 90 dB
*  and it's a screeching horrible sound.
*  It's the most punishment that an IRB committee
*  will let you endure on a participant in an experiment,
*  unless you're in Stanford 70 years ago
*  or whatever that was.
*  I was referring to the classic prisoner experiment,
*  which took place in the building next door
*  to where I work, by the way.
*  So you can blast the other participant
*  with varying levels of sound.
*  And you have a selection box from something very low
*  to something very high.
*  And what's nice about this is that it then allows you
*  to quantify aggression.
*  Because the more volume you're blasting the opponent,
*  the more aggressive you are towards your opponent.
*  And so you have a measure of aggression.
*  Again, the Tyler aggression paradigm,
*  obviously invented by Tyler, very well validated,
*  studied all over, a very standard protocol.
*  So we brought in participants and had them play
*  the Tyler, the tap, either under exposure
*  to hexadecanal or control.
*  Now, hexadecanal doesn't, it's incredibly difficult
*  to even detect hexadecanal, but just in case,
*  because it's not very, very, it's considered a semi-volatile.
*  It doesn't have a strong smell.
*  But we buried it both, the control and the hexadecanal
*  in a control order that hid them in a mask.
*  And she ran lots and lots and lots and lots of participants,
*  men and women.
*  And I'll first tell you the result with men,
*  which is that hexadecanal consistently reduced aggression.
*  People were less aggressive under hexadecanal.
*  The effect size was quite meaningful.
*  And later on we learned, because I'm no specialist
*  in the world of aggression, but compared to the effects
*  seen in the aggression world in research,
*  really, really strong effects, so unusually strong.
*  So hexadecanal lowered aggression in men
*  and we were like, cool, this is sort of what we were hoping
*  to see consistent with the hypothesis
*  and consistent with what it seems to do in mice.
*  But then we looked at the data from women
*  and hexadecanal increased aggression.
*  Equally significantly.
*  Is this thought to be something related
*  to maternal protectiveness?
*  We're getting there.
*  So you got there really fast.
*  It took me a year, and Eva got to it really,
*  I'll tell you, because remember we're reaching
*  the back of the head of your, whose was it?
*  Grandchildren?
*  Charles Zucker.
*  Charles Zucker.
*  The Charles Zucker.
*  One of the kingpins of the New York neuroscience mafia.
*  Yes.
*  So this was really odd to me at that time.
*  So I didn't have the intuition you just had
*  and I was like, Eva, there was some bug here.
*  I mean, it makes no sense to me.
*  Why would something increase aggression in women
*  and decrease aggression in men?
*  This is really, really strange.
*  And I said, okay, I wanna see this happen again
*  before we go ahead with this.
*  So she went and did the entire experiment again
*  and this time she did it within the fMRI magnet
*  so that we can also track brain activity
*  while this was happening.
*  And first of all, it replicated again.
*  So once again, hexadecanal made men less aggressive
*  and women more aggressive.
*  And the extent of, more than the effect alone,
*  the dissociation was remarkable.
*  This has, it's almost like a chromosomal test.
*  I mean, you look at the data on the unit slope line
*  and all the men are below and all the women are above.
*  There's this figure in the paper.
*  Then she also looked at the brain data
*  and this is, although our lab does a ton of fMRI,
*  it's one of the major tools we use to measure brain activity.
*  I'm quite cognizant of the limitations of fMRI
*  and this is, I think, sadly,
*  I think the only study in my career, at least,
*  where I actually managed to also get a mechanism
*  out of fMRI, not only an area that's involved in activity.
*  And so here's what we saw,
*  that hexadecanal alone increased activity
*  quite pronouncedly in an area of the brain
*  known as the left angular gyrus.
*  Now this is an area involved in what's referred
*  to as social appraisal.
*  So that was kind of cool in that a social order activated
*  the social brain, not the olfactory system per se,
*  and very pronounced.
*  So on one hand, that was cool, but then what was uncool
*  was that it did the same in men and women,
*  and this was in contrast to behavior,
*  which you don't like seeing, right?
*  I mean, because you would expect brain activity
*  to reflect behavior, and it increased activity
*  in the left angular gyrus in both men and women.
*  But then she did a follow-up analysis,
*  which was look at what's referred to
*  as functional connectivity.
*  That is, how does this region of the brain talk
*  with the entire brain as it were
*  under hexadecanal versus control?
*  And here, the dissociation reemerged powerfully,
*  whereby the connectivity from the angular gyrus
*  was mostly through the classic neural substrates
*  of aggression, so the amygdala and the temporal pole,
*  and the connectivity went in opposite directions
*  in men and women.
*  So hexadecanal increased functional connectivity in men
*  and decreased it in women.
*  So in a way, this is almost saying
*  that the default brain reaction is aggression, right?
*  The default is to aggress, and in men,
*  hexadecanal increases the control
*  that the left angular gyrus is holding over your aggression
*  and keeping you back, and in women, let it roam free
*  and they became more aggressive.
*  But I was still puzzled, so I was convinced
*  this happened twice, the MR data provided not only a pattern
*  but a mechanism, which is unusual.
*  And yet, I was telling Eva, you know,
*  but this makes no sense to me.
*  And then her insight, which of course afterwards is like,
*  duh, is no, there's a place where this makes perfect sense,
*  and that is if you're a mammalian offspring,
*  because paternal aggression is often directed at you.
*  There's infanticide all over, and sadly,
*  there's male aggression towards human children as well.
*  And maternal aggression is often protective.
*  So if you're an offspring, if you have a molecule
*  that will make your mother more aggressive
*  and your daddy less aggressive,
*  both of those are good for you, so you're winning.
*  So we remembered a recently published paper
*  from a group in Japan that looked at the odors
*  emanating from baby heads.
*  We now come full circle to Zucker's grandchildren.
*  They used a method known as GCMS,
*  gas chromatography mass spectrometry,
*  to measure the volatiles from baby heads,
*  because baby head odor is a cultural thing across cultures,
*  even in Japan.
*  And so we quickly went to that paper,
*  and to see if one of the molecules
*  that report is hexadecanal,
*  and we were very disappointed that it wasn't
*  one of the molecules that reported in the paper.
*  And so we wrote to the authors,
*  who are since then our co-authors,
*  and we said, look, we're studying this molecule,
*  hexadecanal, and we don't see any results,
*  and we were wondering, maybe you had some results
*  that you didn't publish,
*  or some supplementary materials, or whatever.
*  And this lab, which is a hardcore GC lab, said,
*  no, no, hexadecanal is a semi-volatile, which we knew.
*  And our previous paper was not directed
*  to the semi-volatile range,
*  but we can now do use what's called GCXGC, double GC,
*  that is directed at semi-volatiles,
*  and we can do this again.
*  We just studied 11 babies,
*  and we can see if this is an issue.
*  So we said, yeah, please do.
*  The bottom line of all this is that hexadecanal
*  is the most abundant semi-volatile in baby heads.
*  It's tons of it coming out of baby heads.
*  So babies, again, speaking about
*  if humans do or don't chemo signal,
*  babies are conducting chemical warfare, right?
*  They're reducing aggression in their fathers
*  or males around them,
*  and increasing aggression in their mothers
*  or females around them.
*  And both of those things are good for them.
*  Incredible.
*  This is somewhat different than what we're talking about,
*  and yet similar in other ways,
*  because it's built off of anecdotal evidence,
*  but it's anecdotal evidence that you hear all the time,
*  and yet when you look in the scientific literature,
*  at least by my read,
*  the data are not clear, maybe even contradictory.
*  And that relates to the coordination of menstrual cycles
*  among co-housed women or women who are friends.
*  Many women listening to this,
*  and maybe some men who are aware of this effect,
*  will say, oh yeah, absolutely.
*  When I spend time with my friends or go away camping
*  or even spend a day with them,
*  our menstrual cycles become coordinated.
*  However, my understanding is that the early literature,
*  Barbara McClintock,
*  correct, discovered this phenomenon,
*  published a paper in Science as an undergraduate.
*  1971, Nature.
*  Amazing, Nature paper.
*  Again, one of the three apex journals,
*  and as an undergraduate, fantastic.
*  So discover this, describe this,
*  and probably women all over the world
*  who became aware of this one way or another
*  probably said, yes, absolutely.
*  This gives validation to what we've observed over and over.
*  And yet, as subsequent papers have been published,
*  this result has been called into question.
*  Is there any final word on whether or not menstrual cycles
*  become coordinated among women who spend time together?
*  And if so, is there any role of olfaction in this,
*  or chemo sensing through the nostrils and or mouth
*  to support this idea?
*  So, yeah, so I'll start off indeed to echo the background
*  is that this study was conducted by Martha McClintock
*  when she was an undergraduate at Wesleyan College,
*  and she noticed that she thought her menstrual cycle
*  and her co-inhabitants in her dorm room
*  were coordinated in time.
*  And I should say that this comes on the basis
*  of similar or related type effects in rodents.
*  Now, rodents don't have a menstrual cycle like humans do,
*  but there's an effect in rodents
*  referred to as the Witten effect,
*  which resembles this type of effect.
*  And she published indeed that paper
*  as an undergraduate in Nature in 1971.
*  And to answer your question,
*  she published a follow-up in 1998, also in Nature,
*  with then her graduate student, Chicago Stern.
*  So this is Stern and McClintock, 1998.
*  And here's what they did.
*  They collected sweat from donor women
*  and deposited it on the upper lip of recipient women.
*  So this would be a fun experiment for you,
*  at least because you said you like body odors,
*  but for many others, perhaps it would be daunting.
*  Well, I like certain body odors from certain individuals.
*  Okay.
*  I don't think I uniformly like all body odors,
*  although I do seem to uniformly not like
*  the smell of perfume, although I, just to clarify,
*  I put this out there and I learned the hard way
*  in the comment section on YouTube.
*  Some of those perfumes I find downright aversive.
*  Like it's, I think the great Marcus Meister,
*  who a great neurobiologist once said,
*  there's basically three responses to either yum, yuck, or meh.
*  So some are truly yuck.
*  I've never heard that one.
*  I like that one, right?
*  In terms of the animal behavior, human behavior,
*  we're either move forward, move back, or pause.
*  So some are truly a yuck.
*  Some many are meh.
*  Zero to date are yum for me.
*  Now body odors, the distribution has shifted.
*  It could be any one of those three, yum, yuck, or meh.
*  So just to be clear,
*  but the yum category is definitely included.
*  Thank you for allowing me to do that.
*  Yeah.
*  So she did this study.
*  So because right in the original McLean Talk study,
*  you might suspect other drivers of the effect.
*  You accept the effect,
*  but still there might be other social drivers of the effect
*  that are not body odor, right?
*  There might be some dominant woman
*  who's dominant in some other way,
*  and this might be driving the coordination, right?
*  So here there was no direct link
*  between these women other than body odor.
*  So if the effect re-emerged,
*  it would definitely be an olfactory effect.
*  And what she found is that if she took a sweat
*  from the follicular or the ovulatory phase of the donors,
*  one extended the cycle in recipients
*  and one shortened the cycle in recipients.
*  I don't remember which was which,
*  but basically definitely denoting a chemo signaling effect
*  with opposing effects on duration
*  based on the time it was collected from,
*  again, published in Nature in 1998.
*  That's it.
*  There's a quotation, I think this is from,
*  I'm not sure, but if something's published in Nature
*  or Science, that doesn't necessarily mean it's not true.
*  So with that in mind,
*  the findings were since called into question widely.
*  One reason is just statistics of cyclic events
*  are surprisingly complicated.
*  So it's tricky.
*  Once you have a cyclic event, statistics become tricky.
*  And so Martha took a lot of heat
*  on the statistics of claiming an effect.
*  And I think there was at least one effort of replication
*  that didn't really work out.
*  If you ask me, I'm on the fence.
*  But I may be in a minority in my field.
*  I think a majority in the field is currently negative.
*  I'm not.
*  And we've said in lab that we should do a planned replication.
*  We will.
*  Again, it's a horrible study to run.
*  It's tons of work and you have to run it
*  for a really long time.
*  And so it's just completely non-trivial.
*  But we have a graduate student now in lab
*  interested in these exact things, Root Weissgroves,
*  and she's doing similar stuff,
*  and I hope we'll do that.
*  I hope we'll try to replicate this.
*  Very interesting result.
*  And I think interesting because of its real world,
*  meaning outside the laboratory, of course,
*  or experiment analog, but also because
*  pheromone effects and olfactory effects in humans
*  seem unique among neurobiological slash endocrine phenomena
*  because there seems to be so many stories
*  that we all have of the smell of our grandmother's hands
*  or the recognizing the scent of somebody
*  or I knew from the moment that I smelled their breath
*  or I just liked their smell kind of thing.
*  These kind of things that inform the deep potential
*  for a real biological phenomenon,
*  as opposed to the kind of thing like,
*  oh, you just throw something out there,
*  oxytocin is bonding, and all of a sudden,
*  the general public, to no fault of their own,
*  comes to think that every aspect of bonding is oxytocin
*  and every defect in bonding is lack of oxytocin.
*  But the general public provides a sort of a rich,
*  it's fodder for exploring all these things
*  and a lot of times they turn out to be true, right?
*  In the context of olfactory.
*  It's a very primal system, you know?
*  So it's linked to the most limbic primal mechanisms
*  in our brain and it drives primal behavior.
*  It's an incredible system.
*  I have a question about a particular study,
*  but I'm just gonna cue it up
*  and you'll know immediately what I'm queuing up.
*  And that is, what is the relationship
*  between odors and hormones, and in particular, crying?
*  As I pointed out previously, the sort of flavor of the month
*  in human social chemo signaling research
*  is the smell of fear and the media of the month is sweat.
*  So the few, maybe tens of labs in the world
*  that study human social chemo signaling all collect sweat
*  and that's the media they look at.
*  Is it always from the armpit?
*  Or are there meaningful differences in terms of the sweat
*  emitted from different locations on the body?
*  I already know the answer to that as I ask it,
*  but let's just stay above the waistline.
*  Oh no, no, yeah, yeah.
*  Or below the waistline.
*  We're biologists after all.
*  Yeah, so it's funny.
*  We're working on a paper on that right now,
*  on the smell of fear.
*  So we have a nice paradigm for generating fear.
*  We throw people out of airplanes.
*  It's a very effective way to generate fear.
*  I have to come to your lab.
*  It sounds like the greatest lab in the world.
*  We didn't invent that by the way.
*  The first to do that was,
*  and I hope I'm pronouncing her name correctly,
*  I think it's Mujika Perudi.
*  But that's our paradigm for generating fear.
*  And we started that on our own,
*  but we've since entered into collaboration
*  with the Israeli Paratroopers Brigade
*  and we now collect body odor from every first time jumper.
*  So we went that path because we,
*  like everybody else in this field,
*  the holy grail there is finding the molecules.
*  If you'll have the fear molecules, that's a bonanza.
*  Because you could think of many reasons
*  why it would be a bonanza, but for me,
*  if you find the molecules,
*  you can then try and find the receptors.
*  And when you find the cognate receptors,
*  you can then develop blockers
*  and you can imagine,
*  what's the term I'm looking for?
*  I'm switching to Hebrew.
*  It's about midnight now, right?
*  I'm sorry, it's two in the morning.
*  You're doing incredibly well considering
*  the inversion of the circadian clock.
*  We would never know.
*  No one traveled in today from Israel.
*  So he's a circadian inverted as we say.
*  Anxiety.
*  So you can imagine developing like a nasal spray
*  against anxiety, right?
*  Where you would quell those receptors
*  and kill the fear response, right?
*  Which rather than going the current path,
*  which is through neurotransmitters
*  that then have effects all over the place,
*  you would be getting fear at its source, right?
*  So that would be why I would want that.
*  And we figured out that doing that,
*  collecting fear from like three, four or five people
*  in an experiment,
*  you'll never be able to do analytical chemistry on that.
*  So we now have a setting we call fear bank,
*  which now has more than a thousand samples in it.
*  So we're trying to do analytics on that.
*  But in doing that, we've joined the crowd.
*  Everybody's doing fear and everybody's doing sweat.
*  And in one of our discussions in lab,
*  we were saying, well, there's gotta be,
*  or there potentially definitely could be additional
*  bodily media that are playing to social chemo signaling.
*  Now, many of these, you can't really study, right?
*  I mean, so just to throw it,
*  most terrestrial mammals communicate social information
*  through urine, but starting doing experiments with humans
*  with smelling urine, it would be difficult,
*  both in IRB and in agreement.
*  And then we, this is a rare case
*  where we actually hypothesized what we set out to do.
*  And it's the only claim in retrospect
*  that it was hypothesis is tears.
*  We started thinking about tears and looking into tears
*  because tears are a bodily liquid, emotional tears
*  that we emit in emotional situations
*  where these are situations
*  where nonverbal communication is critical and key.
*  And tears are a liquid that is puzzling
*  beyond ocular maintenance, right?
*  And so, the most influential text, I think,
*  till this day in emotion research is Darwin's book,
*  The Showing of the Emotions in Man and Animals,
*  I think is the full name of the book.
*  And an entire chapter, chapter six, is devoted to tears,
*  an entire chapter of this book.
*  Why?
*  With no conclusion.
*  Why?
*  Because the book revolves around describing
*  the functional antecedents of emotional expressions.
*  So for example, showing of the teeth
*  is a sign of aggression, right?
*  So animals first bit with their teeth
*  and Darwin argued that through evolution,
*  just showing the teeth alone became an aggressive sign
*  because it started from biting.
*  Or what I find is a beautiful example,
*  and this is work partly done by Adam Anderson now at Cornell,
*  is the emotional expression of disgust.
*  So disgust, which comes from the line disgusia, distaste,
*  right, is spitting something out of your mouth.
*  Now, what Adam showed is that
*  the musculature patterns of activation
*  and the temporal sequence of activation,
*  when you experience moral disgust,
*  are the same as when you spit a bitter taste
*  out of your mouth, right?
*  So again, so there's a functional antecedent
*  spitting something out, and through evolution,
*  the argument was that it became an expression of emotion,
*  and you express disgust just as if you're spitting
*  something out of your mouth, even though they're,
*  in the case of moral disgust,
*  there's nothing you're spitting out of your mouth.
*  So Darn systematically went through
*  the expressions of emotions, and for each one,
*  went to their functional antecedent
*  and explained everything very nicely,
*  and then he got stuck with tears, right?
*  Because tears are an obvious emotional expression,
*  and he could not find a functional antecedent.
*  So he ended up saying, you know,
*  this is an epic phenomenon, basically, right?
*  I don't know.
*  What all scientists do when they don't have
*  a good explanation, blame it on nature.
*  Right, right.
*  So, but he bothered to write this entire chapter
*  on the ocular sort of maintenance function of tears
*  and so on and so forth, but nothing emotional.
*  So we thought, well, maybe the function
*  is a chemical signal.
*  And, you know, so with that in mind,
*  we harvested emotional tears,
*  which was also an amusing event on its own, right?
*  Because we posted messages on all sorts of boards
*  that were seeking experiment participants who cry with ease.
*  Now this generated an unfortunate gender bias
*  in our study, right?
*  Because we received about 100 women volunteers
*  and about one man.
*  And, you know, I think this is not a problem
*  only in macho Israel, right?
*  Probably anywhere in the West, this would be,
*  definitely in America would be the same, I think.
*  My guess is that there are probably men out there
*  who cry easily, emotional tears easily.
*  Oh, I'm sure.
*  But they're just gonna show up.
*  Yeah, yeah, that's what I'm saying.
*  It's a cultural thing.
*  It's not, you know, you're not gonna come to a lab
*  and say, yeah, you know, I cry all the time.
*  It's just not gonna happen.
*  And then what we did is for each one of these participants,
*  you know, we would ask them, you know,
*  is there a particular film event that you know of
*  that you are seeing that makes you cry?
*  And interestingly in these effective criers,
*  there's always, oh yes, you know, the scene in So and So,
*  I always cry profusely from that.
*  You know, they have their-
*  Can you give me an example of one of the more commonly
*  named scenes?
*  Yeah, with ease.
*  The movie The Champ.
*  The Champ dies.
*  He's a boxer.
*  And he dies literally in the hands of his
*  about eight-year-old son.
*  And his son is standing next to his bed and, you know,
*  saying, champ, champ, and he dies, right?
*  It's a winner, okay?
*  Waterfall.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Got it.
*  So, you know, we're probably the neurobiology lab
*  with most sad movie films on this shelf in the world,
*  right?
*  We have a whole huge collection.
*  There is such a thing as tears of joy, by the way.
*  So no.
*  No?
*  No?
*  Well, we're going ahead of ourselves,
*  but I say we tried to collect them and failed.
*  Even people who think they shed tears of joy and laughter,
*  their eyes water a bit, but it's not the same thing.
*  The effective criers we end up screening,
*  so we collect a full ML of tears,
*  a full ML of tears in about 15 minutes.
*  So that's pouring, right?
*  And that doesn't happen from laughter,
*  or we've never seen that happen from laughter.
*  We tried.
*  So we have all these sad films,
*  and by the way, one of the amusing things is
*  when we ultimately published this paper in Science,
*  we were forced, in retrospect,
*  to go out and actually buy the films, right?
*  I mean, you know, originally we like downloaded
*  the premiere there, but you can't,
*  because you'd be violating copyright laws.
*  So we had to buy, purchase all these films
*  that the participants watched.
*  So we actually have these in lab,
*  like DVDs that we actually purchased.
*  Nice coverage of potential legal fallout there, no?
*  No, no, no, we did.
*  No, I believe you, I believe you.
*  Yeah, it was that.
*  I believe you.
*  Well, we can touch on that later,
*  but so most of these volunteers
*  who come saying they can cry with ease
*  actually don't meet the bill.
*  And so out of the about 100, at least,
*  more women that we screened, we ended up with about six
*  who could really come to lab week after week in poor tears.
*  There's a name for this in psychiatry.
*  They call it a narrative distancing.
*  Some people, when they watch a film
*  where someone's getting hit, they flinch quite a lot.
*  It's almost as if they're experiencing it,
*  but it works in the opposite direction too.
*  I know someone like this, where if they watch a film
*  that someone's experiencing something even mildly positive,
*  their mood elevates, so they can quickly bridge.
*  And it's not always adaptive, as you can imagine.
*  So there's lack of narrative distancing.
*  Right, yeah.
*  Well, one issue you can bring up
*  with this entire line of studies in our lab
*  is I don't know if there's something very unique
*  about the donors, right?
*  I mean, we're assuming these are tears.
*  No, this is pretty common.
*  I think that the numbers I saw out there,
*  about five to 8% of people.
*  It's exactly what we thought about, right?
*  About 600.
*  So we collected tears
*  and we exposed participants to these tears.
*  And we found a few things.
*  First of all, the tears are completely odorless.
*  You cannot detect them at all, completely odorless.
*  And yet, when you sniff them,
*  you have a pronounced reduction in testosterone
*  within about 20 minutes, half an hour.
*  This is men and women smelling women's tears.
*  Just men smelling women's tears,
*  but not perceiving any odor.
*  Nothing, just sniffing them.
*  And you have about a 14% drop in free testosterone.
*  Okay, so this is testosterone
*  that's already been liberated from the testes
*  and for that we've done a few hormonal
*  that's either bound or unbound,
*  is unbound, excuse me,
*  from sex hormone binding, globulin, et cetera.
*  And it's the active form.
*  So it's subject to very short time scale changes.
*  Yeah, and this is, you know,
*  people who studied testosterone, which is not me,
*  but they tell me this is a really strong effect.
*  Like it's hard to even pharmacologically
*  get an effect like that that fast.
*  I mean, no in pharmacology.
*  Yeah, years ago I spent time
*  studying endocrine effects of this sort,
*  and that's a tremendous resized effect.
*  So here I'll point out in passing
*  that one of the concerns we had
*  because of the effort to run this study
*  is that nobody would ever try to replicate it.
*  And to our joy, about two years later,
*  an independent group from South Korea,
*  Oh It Al, who I don't know at all,
*  replicated the testosterone effect to a T.
*  I mean, like same numbers.
*  So it lowers testosterone.
*  And we then also looked using MR
*  at the effect on brain activity
*  and saw pronounced effect on activity,
*  a dampening, a lowering of activity
*  under an arousing state,
*  a lowering of activity both in the hypothalamus
*  and in the fusiform gyrus for whatever reason.
*  I don't know. Face recognition area.
*  Amongst other things, yes.
*  And we don't know why.
*  But pronounced.
*  And currently, Shania Grohn in our lab
*  is replicating this again.
*  And this time with a stronger behavioral component.
*  And I can share with you unpublished data now under review
*  that's as you would expect,
*  given the effect on testosterone perhaps,
*  sniffing tears lowers aggression in men.
*  Using again the TAP,
*  the same experiment used by Yvain
*  in the hexadecimal experiment.
*  I'm gonna think of that as the sadist,
*  the control, the titration, the sadist titration.
*  Tyler aggression paradigm.
*  Not unlike the Milgram experiments of the 1950s,
*  which post, this was looking at sort of
*  post Holocaust behavior,
*  people basically in American laboratories
*  thinking they were torturing other people
*  simply because they were told to.
*  And a lot of people did that,
*  even though most people would report
*  that they would never torture somebody else.
*  Humans are not a wonderful species.
*  Or as we could say, I think it was the great Carl Jung
*  that said, we have all things inside of us,
*  but the goal is not to experience them all, certainly.
*  It's an incredible study.
*  And it points again to the power
*  of these chemo sensory systems and pathways.
*  And obviously there's so much here.
*  I don't know if you want me to tell about this or not,
*  and I guess you can edit it out.
*  Please don't.
*  This is just sharing stories about the politics of science.
*  So whereas the effect on testosterone
*  was replicated by an independent group,
*  in the original study in science,
*  where it had three components.
*  One was the effect on testosterone,
*  which was robust,
*  the second which was brain activity, which was robust.
*  And there was a significant but weaker effect on behavior.
*  And I don't think we studied
*  the right behavior in retrospect.
*  What we looked at then was ratings of arousal
*  associated with pictures.
*  And there was an effect, it was significant,
*  but it was not what carried the story.
*  Now there's a lab in Holland
*  of a guy by the name of,
*  I'm probably mispronouncing this,
*  but I think it's Wingerhoutz.
*  For the non-Dutch.
*  Yeah.
*  Dutch names are always a little bit of a challenge.
*  And I shouldn't say that, being an Israeli,
*  I shouldn't go too much on that line.
*  But that lab really didn't like our research.
*  They didn't like the original tear story.
*  And the reason they didn't like it
*  is because they've built a career on this notion,
*  including a book with this title,
*  that emotional tears are uniquely human.
*  Now here I should, well, I should share.
*  So one of the things we really liked about the tear result
*  is that partially before we did our work,
*  but more afterwards.
*  And we liked that because usually things,
*  so usually in our chemo signaling work,
*  like what I told you before about the Bruce effect,
*  we look at what happens in rodents
*  and we see if the same thing is happening in humans.
*  This was a rare case where after we did this work,
*  more or less identical effects were discovered in rodents.
*  So a paper published in Nature two years later
*  found that mouse tears, mouse pup tears,
*  lower aggression in male adult mice towards them.
*  In a smell dependent way.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  So, and they also actually found the actual component
*  in tears that, so the tear pheromone
*  that lowers aggression, right?
*  So, this has us thinking of, as tears,
*  as you can think of tears as like a chemical blanket
*  in a way that you're covering yourself up again with,
*  to protect against aggression, right?
*  And so our finding, which to me,
*  I mean, this is consistent with how I think about behavior
*  I don't think beyond language, there are very few things,
*  definitely sensory things that are uniquely human.
*  I'd be hard pressed.
*  But so, our finding went against their story, right?
*  Because here we're saying, no,
*  tears are this chemo signaling mechanism like all animals.
*  And by the way, just after this entire debate,
*  about six months ago, there was a paper in Kern Biology
*  that dogs emit emotional tears.
*  And it was, the dogs emit emotional tears
*  when they reunite with their owners.
*  And you were talking before about oxytocin.
*  So I think what they showed there is that not only that,
*  but that the view as seeing the tears in the dog
*  influences oxytocin in the humans.
*  I hope I'm getting this right.
*  No, I absolutely believe this.
*  I mean, from the time I brought Costello home
*  at eight weeks old, he's my dog, unfortunately,
*  he passed away, but it hasn't been a long time.
*  Actually, the only time I can recall crying,
*  listen, I've certainly cried before many times in my life,
*  many, many times.
*  The only time I ever recall crying to the point
*  where I wasn't sure that I could keep producing two years,
*  but somehow did is when I had to put him down, right?
*  It's just like, and if I talk about too long now,
*  I'll start crying.
*  It's one of those things.
*  I think it's a healthy emotional state.
*  But I recall when he was a puppy thinking,
*  this oxytocin thing must be real,
*  because I can recall being in faculty meetings,
*  which are fairly stated are not always that interesting,
*  but they could be pretty interesting.
*  And someone presenting data in my mind thinking,
*  I hope Costello is okay.
*  What's he doing down in my office?
*  This is when he was very little.
*  And also not needing to eat,
*  not being able to focus on anything else
*  except my attachment to him for about the first two
*  or three weeks that I had him, then it was easy.
*  Then I could focus off on other things.
*  And I think that dogs, perhaps through oxytocin,
*  hijack the circuitry that's intended for childbirth.
*  I really do.
*  Otherwise, why would people be so ridiculously
*  attached to their dogs?
*  Hence all the posts of everyone thinks their dog
*  is the cutest dog,
*  the same way everyone thinks their children
*  are the cutest children.
*  Costello, by the way, was a very handsome bulldog.
*  So, yeah, so again, so even, you know,
*  to put another nail in that story of tears
*  are uniquely human, so they're not.
*  Dogs shed emotional tears.
*  And so that group really didn't like this.
*  And they went ahead and tried to replicate
*  and to your listeners, I'm showing double quotations
*  on the replicate, only the behavioral part,
*  the ratings of arousal in women, of women,
*  and failed to replicate that, I see.
*  Now, this was, you know, just sharing on how science works
*  and doesn't work in my notion in this case.
*  So at the time, after they got this accepted
*  in some journal, not a field journal,
*  in the journal of memory of something,
*  they contacted me for a response.
*  And I wrote to the authors and I said, look, you know,
*  this is very odd to me, why don't you come,
*  you know, why don't we replicate this again together
*  and see if it doesn't work?
*  If it doesn't work, I'll publish it with you
*  that it doesn't work, but you know.
*  And so I said, why don't you send over a graduate student
*  or the lead author and we'll do it here
*  and we'll show them how it's done
*  because they did it very wrongly in the paper.
*  And so they replied that, no, they don't have money
*  to send over a graduate student to do it.
*  So I replied saying, okay, I'll fund the graduate student
*  coming over and I'll fund the entire study
*  and their stay and so on and so forth
*  and let's do this together.
*  And they replied, no, they're not willing to do that,
*  which I don't think is the way things should work.
*  And they published this sort of failed behavioral effect
*  in that paper.
*  So I'm just sharing this, you know, that it's not only,
*  there was that successful replication
*  with the effect on testosterone,
*  but there was supposedly this failed replication
*  on the effect in behavior.
*  And then I published a rebuttal on that,
*  which I don't know if I should have done, but I did.
*  Well, I think it's interesting.
*  I mean, I think provided studies are done correctly.
*  I mean, the positive result
*  almost always trumps the negative result.
*  And yet I think replication is key.
*  The problem as you pointed out is that replication
*  is rarely pure replication of the exact study.
*  This one is not even remotely,
*  but I published the detailed.
*  So actually they hid something in their data
*  that did partially work.
*  So I asked for their data and I reanalyzed it
*  and that's what I published in the rebuttal.
*  But you know, this is just sharing on how science works.
*  I took advice, so it's not that I'm friends with him,
*  but at that time I was communicating a bit
*  because we were on some board with Daniel Kahneman,
*  who's Nobel laureate.
*  Thinking fast and slow.
*  Right, and so I asked him, how should I deal with this?
*  You know, give me some advice here.
*  I was really, you know, it was emotionally not fun
*  to be in that position.
*  And he said, don't never publish a rebuttal.
*  Don't do anything.
*  And I was, you know, how can I, you know,
*  I have to do something.
*  And he said, no, don't, because once you do that,
*  then, you know, people don't go into the details.
*  They won't read the details of your rebuttal.
*  They'll be like, well, there's a group that says this
*  and there's a group that says that.
*  So it's unclear.
*  Well, and you know, I mean, I appreciate
*  that you're bringing it up today
*  and I do appreciate that you published the rebuttal
*  and that you offered in a very magnanimous way
*  to do a collaboration.
*  That's what he then said.
*  That's it.
*  So Kahneman's advice after that was that,
*  well, if you insist, then just publish,
*  write a response that you offered them
*  to come do it together.
*  They refused and there's nothing you can do about that.
*  It's a lot like fight sports, right?
*  People talk a lot of trash.
*  Although in science, you know, I will say this,
*  you know, as long as we're on the sociology of science.
*  The stakes are lower.
*  Science is very different than podcasting
*  or social media or other fields,
*  because in science, people generally
*  are very kind to your face.
*  And then you get it in the neck on grant reviews
*  or anonymous reviews.
*  I was on a grants review panel this morning.
*  I'm a nice reviewer, meaning I judge things objectively,
*  but I try to always think from the perspective
*  of the graduate student or author of the proposal.
*  Listen, I think that science is a game
*  of people who most of them are seeking facts.
*  However, the ego is strongly woven into it
*  like anything else.
*  So I think it was very magnanimous of you
*  to offer the collaboration.
*  So I'm gonna tell this lab whose name I can't pronounce,
*  please accept the collaboration.
*  Then we can invite everyone on here for a round table.
*  I appreciate that you shared that story.
*  And I know a number of other people will
*  for a number of reasons.
*  I have a couple of more questions.
*  And I realize, and thank you by the way,
*  for your willingness and stamina,
*  because it is probably 1 a.m. Israel time now,
*  and you just arrived.
*  But you're doing a terrifically well.
*  So if you'll indulge us just a touch further,
*  there are two topics that I wanna touch on.
*  If you wanna cover these in shorter thrift,
*  that's fine, although I don't feel any obligation to.
*  The first one is, I think most people are familiar
*  with the scent of food or foods as a signal
*  of the nutrient contents of those foods.
*  An orange that smells great
*  or the smell of something baking.
*  It suggests something about the contents
*  and quality of that food.
*  After all, you and I both separately lived
*  in the same apartment in Berkeley above the cheese board,
*  which the smell of food wafting up through the cheese board
*  is something I will never forget, and the breads.
*  Never forget it.
*  Amazing bread.
*  I don't know if you've conveyed that clearly enough
*  to listeners or watchers.
*  The probability is-
*  That we really just discovered
*  that we lived in the same, we never met,
*  I mean, a fit like this before.
*  Yep.
*  And we lived in the same apartment.
*  Exactly.
*  Are we click friends?
*  What?
*  I had a, in a lingering way, I guess.
*  Absolutely.
*  Through the-
*  Through the-
*  Floorboards.
*  It had a great floor, that place.
*  It had a great wooden floor.
*  Floor was an amazing place.
*  I lived there with my girlfriend for a year and a half.
*  And then it was an amazing place.
*  We won't give out the address,
*  out of respect for the people that live there now.
*  But do check out the cheese board if you ever in Berkeley.
*  Their hours are weird, so you have to look online,
*  but it's a unique place with great bread and cheese
*  and some good flavors of pizza.
*  In any case, I'm wondering whether or not smell
*  can signal things about the nutrient contents of foods
*  in a way that's divorced from the smell
*  that we are perceiving.
*  So for instance, I could imagine,
*  based on what you've told us about smell today,
*  that I, I don't know,
*  I smell a piece of meat cooking and it smells great to me.
*  And I think of it as, oh, that's so savory
*  and my mouth is watering and I love the smell of this.
*  And I'm thinking, okay, this is protein and fat
*  and I love the taste of steak and a little bit of char.
*  But that nature has co-opted that to ensure,
*  or I should say, increase the likelihood
*  that I will ingest some other thing that's in steak
*  that has no odor,
*  but whose nutrient content is very important to me.
*  For instance, amino acids.
*  I mean, amino acids are essential to life.
*  And yet we don't go around sniffing for amino acids,
*  we go around sniffing for savoriness,
*  umami-type tastes and things of that sort.
*  So I could imagine a million different examples of this.
*  In the same way, I could imagine that the scent of somebody
*  that we fall in love with or become romantically attached to
*  or sexually attracted to is signaling all sorts of things
*  about, sure, the potential for offspring
*  of a particular immune status.
*  That's a long-term game, but also something about
*  pleasure and safety of a potential interaction.
*  So what I'm asking here is about whether or not
*  there are subconscious signals that the olfactory system
*  has learned to seek, but learned to seek through
*  more overt signals,
*  sort of the tip of the iceberg for now and on.
*  So, you know, I don't have a good answer for you,
*  although I think it's a really good question
*  or a good idea, in fact.
*  So whether there's odor cues on nutrient value
*  is a really good idea.
*  Moreover, it's probably good to the extent
*  that somebody probably did it and I should know and don't.
*  We haven't done anything on that line.
*  So I don't know.
*  I don't know if the nutrient value of food
*  is systematically encoded in odor.
*  If that's not been done, and I will check
*  after our meeting today, then it should be.
*  That's a really good idea.
*  I mean, one of the reasons I asked this is because,
*  you know, the obesity crisis in the US is a huge issue
*  and elsewhere, and highly processed foods,
*  you know, have a lot of things that are problematic,
*  but one of the things that they don't have often
*  is a direct relationship between the scent,
*  the taste, and the nutrient content.
*  And I don't mean macronutrients, sugar, fat,
*  excuse me, carbohydrates, fats, and proteins,
*  but the vitamins and micronutrients,
*  things that support the microbiome,
*  whereas foods that are not highly processed,
*  for instance, meat or a piece of fruit,
*  contain many micronutrients that are vital
*  to aspects of our biology.
*  We don't go around sniffing for probiotics.
*  I'll tell you one sort of factoid
*  that may support your hypothesis here,
*  and that is that there appears to be potential
*  olfactory perceptual similarity in metabolic products.
*  So something that's metabolized from something else
*  has perceptual similarity across those two things.
*  So metabolic cascades play into the coding
*  of olfactory space, and that is consistent
*  with the direction you're implying.
*  But again, I don't know of a direct test of nutrients
*  or nutritional value in smell.
*  And again, the fact that I don't know doesn't mean,
*  of course, that it doesn't exist.
*  And in this case, I would suspect that it should exist
*  in scientific press, and if not there,
*  then with the companies that have vested interest in this,
*  which are many.
*  I can share, just please.
*  An amusing anecdote to share with you
*  is that we've received two independent
*  companies who have turned to our lab recently
*  asking for help to bring odor to engineered meat.
*  That's a growing thing, and all these meats that are not.
*  You had to bring it up.
*  This audience is going to be very polarized
*  along the lines of engineered meat.
*  You're not promoting it.
*  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, I'm agnostic.
*  But we've had two companies turn to us and say,
*  look, we have this great product,
*  but it just doesn't smell like meat.
*  So help us make it smell like meat.
*  Interesting.
*  The reason it's so polarizing is that anything
*  related to nutrition on social media
*  is a total barbed wire topic.
*  We've had experts on nutrition come on here.
*  We'll have more.
*  I know nothing about nutrition.
*  You're safe, no, don't worry.
*  No one is not promoting this.
*  He hasn't even said whether or not
*  he's going to help them out.
*  No, we're not actually.
*  Yeah, it just didn't happen.
*  Whether or not those engineered meats are yum, yuck, or me
*  is a personal issue to people in terms of taste.
*  Whether or not they are better for neutral or worse for you
*  and the planet than given the ingredients that are required,
*  that's a whole world we'll avoid now.
*  I will, but I'll take the opportunity
*  to highlight something related maybe,
*  because on what you're saying on the scale,
*  I'll take the opportunity to dispel
*  another misconception about olfaction.
*  There's this common notion that our sense of smell
*  is incredibly subjective, right?
*  And that what you might like in the smell
*  I will not like in the smell,
*  and that we all have our own totally subjective world
*  of olfaction.
*  I think I know the study you're gonna tell me.
*  There are many.
*  The cross-cultural similarity.
*  There are many.
*  That is utterly untrue.
*  Many not only from my lab, there are many from many labs.
*  Please clarify for those that don't follow this literature.
*  So, yeah.
*  So, humans are incredibly similar to one another
*  in their olfactory perception.
*  And this is in contrast to what most people think.
*  So why is there this misconception?
*  The misconception is there for two reasons.
*  First of all, or for several reasons,
*  but two stand out.
*  First of all, we're attracted by outliers.
*  Because, you know what?
*  I'll tell somebody look, for example,
*  olfactory pleasantness is highly correlated amongst humans.
*  And let's first put this in numbers.
*  You'll take a bunch of humans and a bunch of odorants
*  and have them rate pleasantness.
*  The correlation across the humans will be about 0.8.
*  That's incredibly high.
*  Incredibly high.
*  What do you think is pleasant, I think is pleasant.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Now, why is that go against what culturally people think?
*  For two reasons.
*  First of all, we're attracted or biased by outliers.
*  But that's particularly, that shows in fact the result.
*  What do I mean?
*  So you'll tell somebody, look,
*  people are very similar in their pleasantness estimates.
*  And they'll say, oh, you know that can't be.
*  I love cilantro.
*  And my girlfriend hates the smell of cilantro.
*  Or, and there are a few classic examples there.
*  Guyava is another polarizing odor.
*  So there are a few polarizing odors.
*  And that's true.
*  So that's true that half of the population
*  loves the smell of cilantro and half hates it.
*  Half loves Guyava, half hates it.
*  That's true.
*  Microwave popcorn.
*  However, I assure you that you can come to our lab.
*  We have about 1,000 odorants in our lab.
*  We won't smell the thousand, right?
*  But I assure you, take 100 odorants, okay?
*  From our mixtures and labs, right?
*  And we'll smell them, right?
*  And out of the 100 odors, 90 will totally agree on, right?
*  And including universe, I mean,
*  nobody will say they like the smell of feces
*  or fecal smells.
*  And everybody will say they like the smell of rose
*  and flowery smells.
*  There will be rare, rare exceptions.
*  Again, the correlation is about 0.8 across individuals.
*  So a 90 of 100 will usually be in high agreement.
*  Then five odorants will be in sort of
*  intermediate agreement.
*  And yes, there'll be the five odorants
*  that we're in total disagreement on.
*  But I asked you, if we agree on 95 and disagree on five,
*  are we the same or are we different?
*  We're the same.
*  They're just outliers to this rule.
*  And so one reason is this issue of outliers
*  attract how we think about things,
*  but no, we're actually much more similar than what we think.
*  And the second thing that drives this cultural effect
*  is our poor application of language to all faction, right?
*  So in other sensory systems,
*  we grow up with, we develop with anchors, right?
*  So since you're a little kid,
*  your mother shows you a cow and says,
*  what does a cow do, moo, right?
*  And we all know moo moo.
*  And what color is this?
*  Well, this is kind of an odd black,
*  but it's black, right?
*  Or what color is that?
*  It's red, right?
*  So you have these anchors.
*  But as you all know, the red that I'm seeing
*  is not necessarily the red that you're seeing.
*  We just both know to call that red.
*  And since you say red and I say red,
*  I think why we're seeing the same thing.
*  But no, we're not seeing the same thing, right?
*  And in odor, we don't have those anchors, right?
*  We don't from childhood, our mom doesn't tell us,
*  so what's this smell and what's that smell, right?
*  And so we don't have these language anchors
*  that make us think that we're perceiving the same thing.
*  Now, how can you quantify that?
*  The most important term in measuring sensory systems
*  is similarity, right?
*  That's the measure, right?
*  So what can you do?
*  Let's say we take 10 odorants
*  and I have you rate all the pairwise similarities, right?
*  So you'd end up with 45 numbers, right?
*  So how similar is one to two, one to three, one to four,
*  and then two and all the possible pairwise similarities.
*  Let's say you rate similarity from one,
*  which is totally dissimilar to 100, exactly the same, right?
*  So now I have a similarity matrix
*  that describes Andrew's perception of smell, right?
*  I have, you know, based on these 10 odorants that I selected,
*  now I can run my similarity matrix,
*  and then I can see if the similarity matrix
*  are correlated, right?
*  And then we've gotten rid of the issue of names and odors,
*  right, it doesn't matter if I'll call this lemon
*  and this orange,
*  and you call this sweet potato and this marshmallow, right?
*  It doesn't matter.
*  If I think that these two are highly similar,
*  and you agree,
*  and I think that these two are very different,
*  and you agree, right, we perceive the world in the same way
*  if our similarity matrices are aligned, right?
*  And what's nice about that is that then you can do that
*  for vision audition and all faction in a common group,
*  and you can see where we're more alike each other or not.
*  And we've done that for color vision,
*  all faction, and tonal audition, okay?
*  And we are most dissimilar in color vision, okay?
*  In color vision, the variance is about 100%.
*  Amazing, that's quite different.
*  And there's tons of literature on this, tons of it,
*  tons of it, right?
*  And in all faction and audition, they're about the same.
*  So we're not different, we're very similar.
*  We're just very poor at appreciating this.
*  And mind you, not that there's not variability,
*  there is variability.
*  And of course the system is malleable,
*  as all sensory systems are,
*  so you can learn to like an odor,
*  and that will change you and learn to dislike an odor,
*  but just the way you can learn to like a sound
*  or dislike a sound.
*  So this doesn't take away from the hardwired link
*  of a structure to its perception that they're malleable.
*  And we're not very variable, we're actually kind of similar.
*  That's a perfect segue to the question I have next,
*  which is if in general people perceive certain odors
*  similarly, you could imagine that odors could be
*  manufactured, co-opted, et cetera,
*  in order to elicit richer sensory experiences
*  and drive choice-making.
*  That's obvious at the level of the smell of a hot dog stand
*  or freshly baked bread, et cetera.
*  But what I'm talking about here,
*  and I'd like to ask you about is doing this at scale
*  and scientists, geeks like to say in silico,
*  through computers.
*  So for a long time now, there's been this idea
*  that there will soon be Google smell,
*  not to call out Google as the only search engine,
*  but duck, duck, go smell,
*  for those of you that don't want to hear smell.
*  Chat GPT. Chat GPT, and on and on.
*  In other words, visual information is sent
*  through computer interfaces as is auditory information,
*  not so much haptic somatosensory, although it can.
*  Our lab uses VR.
*  It can be done, but it hasn't really taken hold.
*  However, smell being such a rich source of behavioral
*  and hormonal and other sorts of deep, deep information
*  that can drive people into yum, yuck, or meh
*  type decision-making, seems like an amazing candidate.
*  So what is your experience with generating smells
*  in silico, in computers?
*  And here, folks, for those of you that aren't catching on
*  to this, and I don't expect that everyone would,
*  because what we're really alluding to here
*  is the idea that you'll put into a search engine
*  blueberry pancakes recipe, and that not only will you get
*  photos of those blueberry pancakes and a recipe,
*  but you will get the hopefully validated odor
*  of those pancakes and that recipe coming at you
*  in real time through the computer.
*  So I'll start off answering from the name
*  you threw out there, Google.
*  So about, probably about five years ago,
*  Google had an April Fool's spoof.
*  Oh, right.
*  And they put out this video of Google smell, okay?
*  And it had all these classic sales images of
*  holding up your phone to a rose and it generating rose
*  and all these things, right?
*  So Google is now trying to do that.
*  And they just published, I mean, I know they've been trying
*  to do it for a while, they visited our lab,
*  but they just sort of went public with this,
*  that really just like about a month ago or something,
*  that they have this offshoot startup,
*  I think it's called Osmo or something like that,
*  that started off with a ridiculous sum of money
*  for a startup, like, I don't know, tons of money.
*  There's a lot of money in that world.
*  Yeah, in Google, yeah.
*  To digitize smell.
*  And there are other companies that are trying
*  to do this as well.
*  And we've been talking now for quite a while
*  about our lab's chemo signaling work,
*  but actually half of our lab is devoted to this question
*  of ultimately digitizing smell.
*  And so this is a very, very active field of research.
*  And I'll say one thing that dovetails
*  with what you were talking about before,
*  in many ways, COVID is going to be one of the best things
*  that ever happened to all faction research.
*  Because suddenly all the world is, or all the world,
*  lots of people are very cognizant
*  of the importance of smell.
*  And the smell is like way up there
*  in people's awareness because of COVID.
*  And this is driving a renaissance of all faction research
*  and awareness to all faction is something
*  that's worth paying attention to.
*  And our lab has been involved in this way,
*  in this effort for a long time,
*  where the initial part of this effort is in fact
*  to develop a set of rules that link odor structure
*  to odor perception.
*  That is the going thing was that until recently,
*  at least there was no scientist or perfumer for that matter
*  who could look at the structure of a novel molecular mixture
*  and predict for you how it will smell,
*  or a smell something and tell you what molecular structure
*  could or should be.
*  So in contrast, let's say to trivial like color vision,
*  let's say, so if you know what the wavelength of the light is,
*  you more or less know what perceived color is gonna be.
*  Of course there are exceptions to that
*  and all sorts of issues, but as a rule, you would know,
*  or the other way around, you can generate a wavelength
*  and you would know what color of light
*  it's going to be perceived.
*  So that's an example of where the rules linking structure
*  in this case measured by wavelength and perception
*  in this case experienced this color.
*  The rules are well known.
*  In all fact, we didn't have that until recently.
*  But over the past few years, a bunch of labs
*  have really pushed this forward.
*  There's a bunch of work out of Leslie Voshal's lab
*  at Rockefeller and Andreas Keller working with Leslie
*  who've done a lot of work on this front.
*  Also work from Joel Mainland's lab at Monell
*  and Fair Discovery Joel was a graduate student in our lab.
*  And recently in our lab we've had,
*  and I hope this doesn't come across as overly arrogant,
*  but we've had a sort of mini breakthrough on this front.
*  To call something a mini breakthrough as far from arrogant.
*  And this is a paper led by Arne Ravilla from our lab
*  and Kobi Snitz, also a major contributor there,
*  a paper published in Nature about a year and a half ago
*  in the height of a COVID pandemic.
*  So nobody really, I won't say nobody,
*  but it wasn't noticed in the way it otherwise would have been.
*  It was published in Nature really on like a week
*  where the whole world was like going berserk over COVID.
*  And in this paper, we develop an algorithmic framework
*  where we can predict the perceptual similarity
*  of any two molecular mixtures with very, very high accuracy.
*  So if you give me two molecular mixtures,
*  I can predict how similar you will smell them to be.
*  Okay, now not only could we predict that,
*  but we could design it so we can generate mixtures
*  with known similarities.
*  And the result was highlighted,
*  and you'll appreciate this coming from vision,
*  is that using our algorithmic solution,
*  we generated olfactory metameras.
*  So we measured mixtures completely non-overlapping
*  in their molecular structure,
*  but they smell exactly the same.
*  Okay, now if you would come to a classic perfumer
*  or most classic perfumers and tell them
*  that you can generate two mixtures
*  with zero molecules in common, but smell exactly the same,
*  they would tell you no.
*  And yet we did, and anybody can recreate them.
*  This is simple, actually.
*  And in the paper, we do a few things,
*  like we generate a metamer for Chanel number five.
*  So you don't like perfume, so this one,
*  but we take, so we generate a Chanel number five
*  with no component from Chanel number five in it.
*  Okay, and we actually have a publicly available website.
*  I'll give it to you for your links.
*  If you want that anybody can do this,
*  we built an engine that you can generate
*  these metameras.
*  Now, once we did that,
*  in a way we've generated the infrastructure
*  for digitizing smell.
*  Because, again, what our algorithm predicts,
*  our framework predicts is similarity,
*  but in a way that's enough for you.
*  Why is that enough?
*  We have a map of 4,000 molecules.
*  For each one, we know their perceived smell.
*  Now you can make up any mixture you want for me.
*  I can project it into that map
*  and measure its pairwise distance
*  from all the points in the map.
*  If it falls on lemon, then what you generated
*  smells like lemon.
*  And if it falls on tomato,
*  then what you generated smells like tomato.
*  So we now solve that problem.
*  We can predict the odor of any molecular mixture.
*  We can see how it's going to smell.
*  What we can do is then find a set of components,
*  which we call odor primaries,
*  that can be used to mix any odor that you can perceive.
*  And that's what we're working on now.
*  And about a month ago,
*  so this is in collaboration with a lab
*  of Jonathan Williams and Max Planck in Munich.
*  Jonathan Williams is an atmospheric chemist,
*  but he's really good at using GCMS,
*  measure molecules.
*  So Jonathan Williams measured odorants in Germany,
*  transmitted the information to us over IP.
*  We fed that into our algorithmic framework
*  and recreated it from a device that mixes primaries.
*  And we tried to do four different odorants
*  in our proof of concept test.
*  One of them was Rose,
*  and we failed at recreating Rose.
*  We in fact recreated something that had a percept,
*  but most people perceived it as bubble gum.
*  The second one we tried to do was Anise,
*  and we failed at recreating Anise.
*  And most people said it was Cherry,
*  which is not very far, but it failed.
*  The third was gasoline,
*  and we were slightly but significantly better than chance
*  at recreating gasoline.
*  And the fourth was violets.
*  We had a total of 16 people send violets.
*  So the first odor ever transmitted over IP is violets,
*  and we did that last month.
*  Of course, this is not anything near a practical solution.
*  The device that Jonathan was using to measure
*  is a $1.5 million device bigger than this table.
*  That's right, I remember when VCRs,
*  half the audience won't even know what that is.
*  VCRs were like this big, so we're all good.
*  I'm all good with the prediction
*  that things will come down in size and cost.
*  Yeah, I was saying, don't hold your breath
*  for this to be on your table tomorrow.
*  And again, all we have in hand
*  is this very initial proof of concept.
*  It's not even yet close to being a paper we are submitting
*  because there's still lots of work to be done.
*  But we're on the path.
*  And Google will probably beat us to it.
*  They got a lot more.
*  I don't know, you seem pretty dogged in there.
*  Yeah, but they have so much more resources
*  that at this stage,
*  and they've already published two papers
*  from that effort that are good.
*  They definitely have a lot of dollars and a lot of people,
*  a lot of good neuroscience and other biology engineering,
*  graduate students and postdocs go there.
*  But the real question is, are they getting the best people?
*  Because as you and I both know in science,
*  oftentimes it's small groups of the very best
*  and most creative people that can outrun
*  and outgun large groups.
*  And here I don't have anything against Google, by the way.
*  I use it all the time.
*  I'm not a betting man,
*  but I would put my money on Google on this race.
*  But I'll try and give them a run for their money.
*  There you go.
*  Well, since most of you just want to see the problem solved
*  regardless of who gets there first,
*  what I'll say is you better get going, Google,
*  because Noam is being, he's humble and he's dogged.
*  So better get cracking.
*  There we just cost the weekends
*  and broke up the relationships of a bunch of scientists.
*  I remember when I was a graduate student at Berkeley,
*  I remember hearing there was a guy in our common friend
*  Irving Zucker's lab that worked 100 hours a week.
*  So I was like, oh, I'll work 102 hours a week,
*  which was not a good choice.
*  In any case, it's abundantly clear
*  that you're making progress here.
*  And I go to some of the earlier discussions we had
*  and I think we're not just talking about
*  transferring recipes and smells of food,
*  gasoline from people watching the F1 race or something,
*  but thinking dating apps, thinking you,
*  nowadays everyone knows that when you travel
*  and you want to see your family, your grandkids or kids,
*  better to get on FaceTime and see them or Zoom
*  than to just hear their voice.
*  We're also talking about being able to smell them.
*  I'll tell you more than that.
*  I'll tell you more than that.
*  I mean, we're talking now of trying to achieve
*  the olfactory equivalent of circa 1956 black and white TV.
*  Okay. Basically. Right.
*  I mean, you know, I'm not dreaming, let's say,
*  of being able to transmit to you the difference
*  between a Cabernet or Merlot, right?
*  If I can generate something that's vaguely wine,
*  that will be an amazing success from my perspective, right?
*  But jump ahead in your imagination
*  to 4K odor transmission,
*  then medical diagnostics is what you want to be talking about
*  because this is over extension,
*  but you can almost say that every disease will have an odor.
*  I mean, every disease is a specific metabolic process.
*  Metabolic process have metabolites,
*  metabolites have a smell.
*  Olfaction, once it's digitized and high resolution,
*  which again, in our hands, it's not going to be,
*  I mean, we're talking, you know, in my retirement,
*  maybe I'll read about this one day if I'll still have vision.
*  I mean, this is not close,
*  but when olfaction digitization is brought
*  to the equivalent of 4K vision
*  and an audition that you have now,
*  then it will be in medical diagnosis.
*  You'll have, excuse me for the imagery,
*  but you will have an electronic nose in your bathroom.
*  Each one of us will have in the toilet
*  and it will be doing diagnostics all the time.
*  And that's where it's going to go.
*  But again, not anywhere in the very close future.
*  Well, it's certainly an exciting proposition
*  and I'm delighted that you and other groups
*  who are so strong are working on it.
*  I really am.
*  Noam, I want to say thank you for your time today.
*  First of all, this was a tremendously
*  interesting conversation.
*  I mean, we touched on so many things,
*  hormones, smells, the architecture
*  of the olfactory system.
*  I know that people listening to this are realizing,
*  but I'm going to say it anyway,
*  what an incredible gift you've given us
*  as an expert in this field,
*  giving us this tour of the work
*  that you and others who you credit so generously
*  have done to elucidate this incredible system
*  that we call olfaction and chemo sensation.
*  Also just for the incredibly pioneering work
*  that you've done.
*  I don't have many heroes in science.
*  I have heroes outside of science and a few in science,
*  but I'm going to purposely embarrass myself
*  a little bit by saying that
*  from the time I was at Berkeley
*  and I then saw that experiment being done
*  of people foraging, following ascent trails,
*  and then until I was a junior professor,
*  I used that in my teaching slides
*  in a class that I taught
*  that was sort of the early origins
*  of this podcast in many ways.
*  And over and over again,
*  when your laboratory publishes papers,
*  I find like, this is super interesting, super cool,
*  and I find myself telling everybody about it,
*  and that's really what I do for a living
*  and then I blab about it to the world.
*  So thank you so much for the work that you've done
*  and the spirit that you bring to it.
*  Whatever drives that spirit,
*  as the great late Ben Barris used to say,
*  keep going because we are all benefiting tremendously.
*  And I also just want to say that,
*  for people listening to this,
*  the spirit of science is one of,
*  as you mentioned, there's complex politics
*  and all these things,
*  but it's absolutely clear that you delight
*  in the work you do.
*  So I delight in it,
*  I'm grateful for it,
*  I'm grateful for your time today.
*  And so on behalf of me
*  and the many, many people listening to this,
*  I just want to extend a huge debt of gratitude.
*  Thank you so much.
*  So I'm blushing.
*  I don't know if this doesn't come across
*  on the radio podcast,
*  but thank you so much for very warm words.
*  As you know, when you work in your lab,
*  there's these moments where you suddenly discover
*  that somebody cares a bit about it.
*  And those are always very rewarding moments
*  because usually you function without that.
*  I guess that's one of the things you need
*  to be a scientist is to have the drive
*  to work without that because it comes only rarely.
*  There's immense gratitude and appreciation
*  for you and what you do from me.
*  And I know from a large segment of the world as well.
*  So my only request is that you come back
*  and tell us about the next results
*  sometime not too long from now.
*  Well, I'm going to catch you live now,
*  although you have the power to edit this.
*  I guess that's not fair.
*  But first you come visit us in Israel
*  and tell us both about the science
*  and the public science work you're doing
*  and then I'll come again.
*  A good bargain and I accept.
*  Delighted.
*  Thank you so much.
*  Pleasure.
