# How to Improve Your Vitality & Heal From Disease | Dr. Mark Hyman
**Andrew Huberman:** [April 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI)
*  Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=0.0s)]
*  where we discuss science [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2.36s)]
*  and science-based tools for everyday life. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  I'm Andrew Huberman, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5.96s)]
*  and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=10.44s)]
*  at Stanford School of Medicine. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=13.68s)]
*  My guest today is Dr. Mark Hyman. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=15.56s)]
*  Dr. Mark Hyman is a medical doctor [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=18.04s)]
*  and an internationally recognized leader [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=19.92s)]
*  in the field of functional medicine. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=22.0s)]
*  He is a practicing physician [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=23.8s)]
*  and the head of strategy and innovation [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=25.240000000000002s)]
*  at the Cleveland Clinic Center for functional medicine. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=27.54s)]
*  Today we discuss what is functional medicine, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=30.34s)]
*  how the different systems of the body interact [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=32.9s)]
*  to improve or degrade our health, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=34.82s)]
*  the science of mitochondria and metabolic health, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=37.04s)]
*  nutrition, inflammation, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=39.54s)]
*  and how you can leverage these factors [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=41.26s)]
*  to improve your physical and mental health [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=43.22s)]
*  and cognitive performance at any age. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=45.08s)]
*  We also talk about how to confront [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=47.94s)]
*  any health challenges you might face [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=49.34s)]
*  by taking a systems-level approach. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=51.06s)]
*  Dr. Hyman's work is unique [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=53.16s)]
*  in that it integrates conventional medicine [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=54.58s)]
*  because after all, he is an MD [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=57.06s)]
*  with what he calls good medicine, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=59.02s)]
*  which is an amalgamation of the best practices [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=60.580000000000005s)]
*  from both traditional and alternative approaches. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=62.86s)]
*  During today's discussion, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=65.82000000000001s)]
*  you'll see that Dr. Hyman's expertise [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=66.98s)]
*  on a diverse range of topics really comes through. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=68.86s)]
*  For instance, we talk about food, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=71.46000000000001s)]
*  both sourcing, micronutrients, macronutrients, timing. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=73.62s)]
*  We talk about exercise, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=76.92s)]
*  and we talk a lot about supplementation [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=78.26s)]
*  and which supplements can provide tremendous benefit [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=80.26s)]
*  for certain people in particular. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=82.82000000000001s)]
*  Dr. Hyman grounds all that knowledge [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=84.78s)]
*  in the latest discoveries in human biology [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=86.58s)]
*  to provide you with actionable tools [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=89.08s)]
*  that you can apply in any case and at any age. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=90.78s)]
*  By the end of today's episode, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=94.1s)]
*  I'm certain that everybody will glean at least one [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=95.36s)]
*  and very likely several important protocol updates [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=97.9s)]
*  that they can incorporate to improve their general health. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=101.58s)]
*  And now for my discussion with Dr. Mark Hyman. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=104.6s)]
*  Dr. Mark Hyman, welcome. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=107.78s)]
*  Thanks, Andrew, so good to be here. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=110.06s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=111.74s)]
*  We go back a few years. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=112.94s)]
*  Yeah, like almost 10. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=114.66s)]
*  It's been awesome to see your arc [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=116.78s)]
*  and you were at it long before I met you. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=119.14s)]
*  I think to kick things off, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=122.34s)]
*  probably best if you explain to people [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=125.48s)]
*  what functional medicine is [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=127.3s)]
*  and what your orientation towards health and medicine is. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=128.82s)]
*  Because I think there are a few misconceptions out there, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=131.86s)]
*  both about functional health and you, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=135.06s)]
*  but I think also you provide a very unique perspective. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=137.44s)]
*  You've been at this vista that no one else has had [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=141.28s)]
*  where you know people who are deans of medical schools, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=143.74s)]
*  you know people who are biohackers, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=147.02s)]
*  you know the general public, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=148.64000000000001s)]
*  you've treated and treat patients [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=149.9s)]
*  and you also are an experimentalist with yourself [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=151.98000000000002s)]
*  to the extent that you find and can make suggestions [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=155.10000000000002s)]
*  about things that can help people. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=159.9s)]
*  So yeah, tell us how you parachuted into this whole thing [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=161.06s)]
*  and how you look at this whole thing [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=164.98000000000002s)]
*  that we call health and medicine. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=167.10000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, thank you, Andrew. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=169.3s)]
*  I would say that I didn't choose what I'm doing, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=171.38s)]
*  it chose me. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=175.1s)]
*  I was super healthy, fit, riding my bike 100 miles a day, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=176.06s)]
*  I was 36 years old and then wham, I got really sick. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=180.70000000000002s)]
*  And I went from being able to memorize 30 patients in a day [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=184.3s)]
*  and dictate their notes and ride my bike 100 miles [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=187.46s)]
*  to not knowing where I was at the end of a sentence [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=190.26000000000002s)]
*  and not being able to barely walk up the stairs [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=193.18s)]
*  and I got hit with chronic fatigue syndrome. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=195.82s)]
*  And I tried to figure out what it was, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=199.14000000000001s)]
*  I went to doctors at Harvard, at Columbia, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=201.22s)]
*  here, everywhere and they all, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=203.66s)]
*  you're depressed, take some Prozac, this and that. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=205.06s)]
*  And I realized that I, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=207.38s)]
*  traditional medicine wasn't having the answers. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=210.26s)]
*  And even though I sort of came from the perspective [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=212.3s)]
*  of like a yoga teacher before I was a doctor, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=216.02s)]
*  studied Buddhism, yeah. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=218.34s)]
*  You were a yoga teacher? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=219.74s)]
*  I was, it was back in the 80s. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=220.58s)]
*  You're a tall guy, long mat. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=221.42000000000002s)]
*  They didn't have yoga mats when I was doing yoga. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=223.26s)]
*  He put a towel on the ground, there was no Lululemon. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=225.78s)]
*  It was like on top of like the East West bookstore [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=228.46s)]
*  in New York City, there was like one yoga class [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=231.94s)]
*  in the early 80s, that was it. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=233.98000000000002s)]
*  And I studied Buddhism in college, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=236.78s)]
*  but I also studied systems thinking and systems theory [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=238.10000000000002s)]
*  and Gregory Bateson and the nature of the network effect [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=240.42000000000002s)]
*  of life and biology and everything else. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=243.9s)]
*  And so I kind of went through medical school, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=246.5s)]
*  but when I came out, I was pretty straight [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=249.10000000000002s)]
*  traditional medicine doctor, but then I got sick. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=251.04000000000002s)]
*  And it turned out that I had gone to China [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=253.62s)]
*  to live there for a year and work as a doctor [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=255.5s)]
*  to help start expatriate medical clinics [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=257.66s)]
*  because there were no Western medical clinics in China [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=259.86s)]
*  and people were terrified who were 60,000 expatriates [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=263.5s)]
*  to go to the Chinese hospitals. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=265.58000000000004s)]
*  So I spoke Chinese because I studied Asian studies, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=266.5s)]
*  I went there, but what I inadvertently had happened [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=268.78000000000003s)]
*  was I got exposed to huge amounts of mercury from the air [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=272.46000000000004s)]
*  because they burned coal and coal expels lead [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=276.5s)]
*  and mercury and lots of other toxins. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=279.78000000000003s)]
*  And there's 10 million people in Beijing [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=282.02000000000004s)]
*  and the city at the time and they all heated their homes [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=283.94000000000005s)]
*  with rock coal and I had an air filter [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=286.42s)]
*  that I would clean out every day [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=288.5s)]
*  and breathe the black soot in. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=289.58000000000004s)]
*  So I got like a whopping dose of mercury. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=290.98s)]
*  And it took a couple of years for it [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=294.02000000000004s)]
*  to kind of cause this problem, but from one day to the next, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=295.42s)]
*  I went from being great to not being great. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=298.82s)]
*  My gut broke down, I had diarrhea for years, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=301.06s)]
*  my cognitive function completely went south. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=303.66s)]
*  It was like I had dementia, ADD and depression all at once. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=305.90000000000003s)]
*  I ended up having autoimmune stuff going on [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=309.02000000000004s)]
*  and just rashes and sores and I couldn't think. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=312.38s)]
*  I literally almost had to go on disability. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=316.16s)]
*  And I met a person who introduced me to this guy, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=319.4s)]
*  Jeff Bland, who studied with Linus Pauling [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=321.8s)]
*  and had a very different view of health. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=324.08s)]
*  It really was more around the framework of the body [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=326.04s)]
*  as a network, as a system, as an ecosystem [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=329.44s)]
*  where everything is connected [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=331.68s)]
*  and that it wasn't reductionist, it was inclusive. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=332.6s)]
*  And when we'd go to medical school, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=335.8s)]
*  we were taught to ask for the symptoms, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=337.32s)]
*  look for the signs, do the lab testing, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=340.36s)]
*  and come up with a singular diagnosis to explain everything. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=342.28000000000003s)]
*  And if there's extraneous symptoms [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=346.36s)]
*  that don't fit the thing we're looking for, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=348.84000000000003s)]
*  then we dismiss it. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=352.32s)]
*  If you go to the doctors for migraines [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=353.84000000000003s)]
*  and you say, well, I got irritable bowel, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=358.0s)]
*  go see the GI doctor, or I have this rash, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=360.08s)]
*  you go, oh, see the dermatologist. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=362.52s)]
*  But the truth is the body's connected [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=363.88s)]
*  and everything's connected. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=365.48s)]
*  And so functional medicine is really about [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=366.68s)]
*  understanding the body as a network, as a system. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=368.44s)]
*  And it's a meta framework for understanding biology. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=370.48s)]
*  I think of it as an operating system. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=373.92s)]
*  It's not based on just diagnostic testing or supplements, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=377.08000000000004s)]
*  which a lot of people think it is. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=380.04s)]
*  It's really based on understanding the network of biology. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=381.64000000000004s)]
*  So we were doing microbiome testing. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=383.76s)]
*  We didn't call it that, it was just poop testing back then. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=385.20000000000005s)]
*  We were looking at hormones, at mitochondria, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=388.12s)]
*  at inflammation, at insulin resistance, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=390.96000000000004s)]
*  at all the things that are toxic, environmental toxins, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=392.88s)]
*  and they're all in health. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=395.76s)]
*  And we're trying to understand [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=396.96000000000004s)]
*  how the body started to sort of work. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=397.8s)]
*  And through that process, I literally had to reverse [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=400.36s)]
*  engineer my way back to health [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=402.24s)]
*  by understanding all the systems. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=403.72s)]
*  So my adrenal shut down, my thyroid wasn't working, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=405.0s)]
*  my mitochondria were terrible, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=407.72s)]
*  my muscle enzymes were super high, like CPK were super high, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=408.96000000000004s)]
*  because I had a mitochondrial injury, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=412.32s)]
*  which is the little factories in your cells [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=413.72s)]
*  that make energy. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=416.12s)]
*  I had severe cognitive issues, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=417.40000000000003s)]
*  and neurotransmitter issues, and sleep issues, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=418.8s)]
*  I mean, immune issues, rashes. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=420.96000000000004s)]
*  So my whole system broke down. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=423.24s)]
*  So I literally had to learn every system of the body [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=424.84000000000003s)]
*  and how it worked and how it connected to every other system. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=427.04s)]
*  And then create a healing plan for myself, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=430.4s)]
*  and that allowed me to recover. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=432.8s)]
*  So that really taught me that there's this new way [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=434.04s)]
*  of thinking, and I remember when I was working [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=436.76s)]
*  at Canyon Ranch as the medical director, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=439.24s)]
*  and I would see all these patients coming in, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=442.12s)]
*  and I started to think, well, you know, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=444.44s)]
*  I'm gonna try to do this on my patients [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=447.56s)]
*  and see what happens, and just apply these principles. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=449.15999999999997s)]
*  I call them the laws of biology, right? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=453.52s)]
*  We don't have laws of biology that we can easily describe, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=455.84s)]
*  or laws of medicine, we have laws of physics, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=458.52000000000004s)]
*  but that doesn't mean there aren't laws of biology. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=460.16s)]
*  And what functional medicine, I believe, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=461.88s)]
*  is the first clinical application [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=463.44s)]
*  of this understanding of the laws of biology. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=466.44s)]
*  And there's like scientists like Leroy Hood, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=468.56s)]
*  who created the Institute for System Biology, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=470.8s)]
*  and folks like at Harvard, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=472.6s)]
*  like Cosimo Barbasi, who was studying this, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=474.28000000000003s)]
*  and wrote a book called Network Medicine, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=476.40000000000003s)]
*  about the bodies and network. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=478.16s)]
*  But for me, I had to start to apply this in clinic. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=480.12s)]
*  And so I would, people come in with autoimmune diseases, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=483.64000000000004s)]
*  or with intractable depression, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=486.72s)]
*  or with terrible gut issues, or dementia, or autism, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=489.32s)]
*  or you name it, diabetes, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=493.0s)]
*  and I would apply these principles, and they'd get better. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=494.96s)]
*  And literally I would say, eat this way, don't eat that, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=497.59999999999997s)]
*  simple stuff, like it was not that complicated. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=500.67999999999995s)]
*  And six weeks later, I'd say, they followed visit, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=504.52s)]
*  I'd say, oh, so how you doing? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=506.79999999999995s)]
*  All my symptoms are better. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=507.96s)]
*  I'm like, what, really, your migraines are gone? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=508.84s)]
*  Like, because I didn't believe it. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=511.4s)]
*  Like, it was such a shock to me, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=512.4399999999999s)]
*  as a traditionally trained physician, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=513.84s)]
*  that people were actually getting better. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=515.68s)]
*  And so then I knew, I knew this was something real, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=517.64s)]
*  even though it was sort of 30 years ago, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=519.84s)]
*  it was just sort of not even on the radar, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=521.36s)]
*  it still is pretty much not on the radar, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=522.9200000000001s)]
*  although like, New York Times is doing articles about it now. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=525.08s)]
*  Things are changing. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=527.64s)]
*  Things are changing. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=528.48s)]
*  Slowly, but they're changing, I think. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=529.3000000000001s)]
*  Which sort of dovetails with the question I was going to ask, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=531.28s)]
*  which is, how did the medical establishment [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=534.64s)]
*  view this stuff? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=538.0s)]
*  You know, these days, it's so complicated, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=539.88s)]
*  without taking off on a tangent here. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=542.0s)]
*  The word expert is gated politically. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=545.52s)]
*  Like, one side feels like they can only be called expert [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=548.1999999999999s)]
*  if you're with their camp. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=551.24s)]
*  The other side is now associated with kind of more of a, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=552.3199999999999s)]
*  like a wellness aspect. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=556.92s)]
*  And I don't even have to say which side I'm referring to here. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=559.64s)]
*  And it's become a real clash of, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=562.28s)]
*  we only believe in randomized control trials. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=565.16s)]
*  Or there's clearly evidence that nutrition matters. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=567.68s)]
*  And it's like, of course, both things are important. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=571.72s)]
*  And so what you're describing here is that you- [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=574.6s)]
*  This intersection. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=576.4s)]
*  This intersection. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=577.24s)]
*  And there really isn't a political home [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=578.28s)]
*  for the intersection, unfortunately. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=580.0400000000001s)]
*  Maybe in these new, in this new- [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=582.28s)]
*  I didn't know cells had a political ideology. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=585.48s)]
*  That's right, that's right. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=588.08s)]
*  No, that's right. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=591.08s)]
*  They got the red cell and the blue cell. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=591.9200000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=593.2s)]
*  And that's what I love about you, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=594.0400000000001s)]
*  is that you have friends in both camps, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=595.26s)]
*  and you're willing to trudge forward. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=597.6s)]
*  What did the medical establishment think? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=599.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=601.64s)]
*  And how many of you are there now? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=602.48s)]
*  Yeah, it's a great question. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=607.0s)]
*  I mean, I remember talking about leaky gut [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=608.28s)]
*  almost 30 years ago, and talking to allergists [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=611.16s)]
*  and immunologists- [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=614.08s)]
*  People thought you were crazy. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=614.92s)]
*  And people thought I was a loony-toon. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=615.76s)]
*  Same thing with chronic fatigue, by the way. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=618.24s)]
*  I remember when chronic fatigue syndrome [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=619.76s)]
*  was considered psychosomatic. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=621.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=623.92s)]
*  It's, you know, people are crazy [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=624.76s)]
*  if they think they have this. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=625.96s)]
*  And we now know, like fibromyalgia, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=627.4399999999999s)]
*  chronic fatigue, and leaky gut. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=630.96s)]
*  This all used to be, for those that are listening, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=632.96s)]
*  they're a little bit younger than Mark and I, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=634.64s)]
*  that that was considered pseudoscience. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=637.12s)]
*  Just the whole notion. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=640.2800000000001s)]
*  There are now departments [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=641.12s)]
*  at major university medical centers [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=643.08s)]
*  devoted to each one of these. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=645.08s)]
*  That's right. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=646.84s)]
*  Maybe not whole departments, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=647.6800000000001s)]
*  but sectors within departments. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=648.5s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's crazy how things have changed. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=649.9200000000001s)]
*  And so now we have people who are talking [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=652.84s)]
*  about mitochondria in medicine. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=656.6800000000001s)]
*  Like Christopher Palmer, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=658.8s)]
*  who's a Harvard professor psychiatrist [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=661.0799999999999s)]
*  who's studying psychiatric disease [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=663.3199999999999s)]
*  and the application of diet nutrition [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=664.9599999999999s)]
*  to treat bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=667.28s)]
*  I will say Stanford, sorry to cut you off, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=670.1999999999999s)]
*  now has a division within our department of psychiatry [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=672.4399999999999s)]
*  on metabolic psychiatry, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=676.68s)]
*  in large part thanks to Chris's work. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=678.7199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=681.28s)]
*  And yeah, so metabolic psychiatry [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=682.12s)]
*  is about the role of sort of insulin resistance [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=683.8s)]
*  and inflammation in the brain [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=685.76s)]
*  as causing depression and causing anxiety [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=686.92s)]
*  and more severe things like bipolar disease [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=689.52s)]
*  since born and schizophrenia. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=693.16s)]
*  And these are the things that I saw in my patients. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=694.3199999999999s)]
*  So I wasn't an academic, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=696.9599999999999s)]
*  but I would just look at their story and listen to it. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=698.0799999999999s)]
*  And then I would look at the underlying biology [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=701.56s)]
*  because you talk about the sort of intersection [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=703.76s)]
*  of the sort of the biohacking kind of wellness [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=706.3199999999999s)]
*  and medical community. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=708.16s)]
*  Lee Hood has a term for this. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=709.56s)]
*  He calls it scientific wellness. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=710.7199999999999s)]
*  And when people ask me what functional medicine is, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=712.8399999999999s)]
*  I say it's a science of creating health [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=714.76s)]
*  as opposed to the science of treating disease. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=716.56s)]
*  When you create health, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=718.72s)]
*  disease goes away as a side effect. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=719.96s)]
*  So if you optimize your basic body systems, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=721.76s)]
*  your gut, your immune system, your mitochondria, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=724.12s)]
*  your detox system, your hormonal regulatory system, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=725.92s)]
*  when you optimize those things, symptoms go away. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=728.88s)]
*  And you don't have to treat all the different branches [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=732.24s)]
*  of the trees and the leaves on the trees, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=734.4s)]
*  you treat the root in the trunk, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=735.96s)]
*  which is what functional medicine does. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=737.12s)]
*  I'd like to take a quick break and thank our sponsor, JOOVE. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=739.36s)]
*  JOOVE makes medical grade red light therapy devices. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=742.76s)]
*  Now, if there's one thing that I have consistently [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=746.04s)]
*  emphasized on this podcast, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=747.8s)]
*  it is the incredible impact that light can have [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=749.4399999999999s)]
*  on our biology. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=751.8s)]
*  Now, in addition to sunlight, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=752.92s)]
*  red light and near infrared light sources [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=754.16s)]
*  have been shown to have positive effects [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=756.48s)]
*  on improving numerous aspects of cellar and organ health, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=758.3199999999999s)]
*  including faster muscle recovery, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=761.0799999999999s)]
*  improved skin health and wound healing, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=762.9599999999999s)]
*  improvements in acne, reduced pain and inflammation, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=765.12s)]
*  even mitochondrial function and improving vision itself. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=768.36s)]
*  What sets JOOVE lights apart [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=771.5999999999999s)]
*  and why they're my preferred red light therapy device [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=772.92s)]
*  is that they use clinically proven wavelengths, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=775.48s)]
*  meaning specific wavelengths of red light [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=777.52s)]
*  and near infrared light in combination [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=779.76s)]
*  to trigger the optimal cellar adaptations. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=781.96s)]
*  Personally, I use the JOOVE whole body panel [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=784.76s)]
*  about three to four times a week. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=786.9200000000001s)]
*  And I use the JOOVE handheld light, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=788.48s)]
*  both at home and when I travel. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=790.32s)]

*  Today's episode is also brought to us by 8 Sleep. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=811.0799999999999s)]
*  8 Sleep makes smart mattress covers [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=814.16s)]
*  with cooling, heating and sleep tracking capacity. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=815.8399999999999s)]
*  Now I've spoken before on this podcast [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=818.76s)]
*  about the critical need for us to get adequate amounts [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=820.3199999999999s)]
*  of quality sleep each and every night. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=822.4s)]
*  Now, one of the best ways to ensure a great night's sleep [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=824.68s)]
*  is to ensure that the temperature [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=827.16s)]
*  of your sleeping environment is correct. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=828.4799999999999s)]
*  And that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=830.4s)]
*  your body temperature actually has to drop [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=833.52s)]
*  about one to three degrees. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=835.3199999999999s)]
*  And in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=836.84s)]
*  your body temperature actually has to increase [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=839.4399999999999s)]
*  by about one to three degrees. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=841.48s)]
*  8 Sleep automatically regulates the temperature of your bed [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=843.28s)]
*  throughout the night according to your unique needs. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=846.12s)]
*  Now I find that extremely useful [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=848.6s)]
*  because I like to make the bed really cool [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=850.36s)]
*  at the beginning of the night, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=852.04s)]
*  even colder in the middle of the night [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=853.6s)]
*  and warm as I wake up. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=855.28s)]
*  That's what gives me the most slow wave sleep [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=857.16s)]
*  and rapid eye movement sleep. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=859.0s)]
*  And I know that because 8 Sleep has a great sleep tracker [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=860.36s)]
*  that tells me how well I've slept [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=862.88s)]
*  and the types of sleep that I'm getting throughout the night. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=864.28s)]
*  I've been sleeping on an 8 Sleep mattress cover [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=866.92s)]
*  for four years now, and it has completely transformed [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=868.84s)]
*  and improved the quality of my sleep. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=871.78s)]
*  Their latest model, the Pod4 Ultra, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=873.8s)]
*  also has snoring detection [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=876.16s)]
*  that will automatically lift your head a few degrees [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=877.4399999999999s)]
*  in order to improve your airflow and stop you from snoring. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=879.76s)]
*  If you decide to try 8 Sleep, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=882.64s)]
*  you have 30 days to try it at home [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=883.92s)]

*  Please. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=907.9s)]
*  I want to tell a story about a patient [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=908.74s)]
*  I had at Cleveland Clinic, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=910.02s)]
*  which actually, by the way, was amazing [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=911.86s)]
*  that Toby Cosgrove, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=913.56s)]
*  who's one of the most renowned figures in medicine [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=914.66s)]
*  and was the CEO of Cleveland Clinic for years, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=916.74s)]
*  invited me to come start a center [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=919.8399999999999s)]
*  for functional medicine there. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=921.3199999999999s)]
*  And we've been 10 years now, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=922.68s)]
*  we've done a ton of research. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=925.0s)]
*  This one patient came to see me [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=926.4s)]
*  and she had a whole list of problems. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=927.64s)]
*  And that's why jokingly I call myself a holistic doctor [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=929.4399999999999s)]
*  because I take care of people with a whole list of problems. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=931.88s)]
*  I want to know everything. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=934.52s)]
*  And functional medicine is inclusive rather than exclusive. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=935.7199999999999s)]
*  It's like rather than discarding things [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=937.88s)]
*  that don't fit your diagnosis, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=939.4s)]

*  how you were born, whether you were breastfed, [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=942.92s)]
*  whether you took antibiotics, [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=944.68s)]
*  if you had traumas, any toxins you're exposed to, [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=945.76s)]
*  whether you eat fish. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=947.68s)]
*  Like we want to know everything. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=948.64s)]
*  And so this woman came to see me, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=950.12s)]
*  she had psoriatic arthritis, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=951.3199999999999s)]
*  which was a terrible disease where your joints break down, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=952.4s)]
*  you had those heart breakups, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=954.72s)]
*  the rashes, and itchy plaques on your skin. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=956.4399999999999s)]
*  But she had a whole bunch of other stuff too. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=959.48s)]
*  She had migraines, she had pre-diabetes, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=961.16s)]
*  she had depression, she was a fifth year old health coach, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=964.4399999999999s)]
*  I mean life coach and business coach [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=967.4399999999999s)]
*  who was very successful but was struggling. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=969.28s)]
*  She had terrible reflux, irritable bowel syndrome. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=970.76s)]
*  So she had all these clusters of diseases. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=973.84s)]
*  And I said, gee, what are these things have in common? [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=975.84s)]
*  What's the root? [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=977.88s)]
*  Inflammation. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=978.76s)]
*  And I know you've talked a lot about this on your podcast, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=980.24s)]
*  but inflammation is sort of the root [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=982.0s)]
*  of many chronic illnesses, whether it's obesity, [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=983.48s)]
*  diabetes, heart disease, cancer, dementia, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=985.48s)]
*  autism, depression, I mean, [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=987.4399999999999s)]
*  the list goes on and on, autoimmune allergy obviously. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=988.8s)]
*  And I said, why don't we look at your gut? [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=991.4s)]
*  Because you're having a ton of gut symptoms, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=994.12s)]
*  you have terrible bloating, distention, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=995.6s)]
*  what I call food baby. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=997.32s)]
*  You know when you eat something, you get a food baby. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=998.4399999999999s)]
*  And she also had been on a history of lots of antibiotics [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1001.48s)]
*  and steroids for rheumatoid arthritis. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1006.48s)]
*  And so I said, look, why don't we just treat your gut [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1009.96s)]
*  and then see what happens. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1012.16s)]
*  So we put her on an elimination diet. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1013.0s)]
*  We eliminated all the inflammatory foods, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1014.44s)]
*  things that were causing fermentation [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1016.4s)]
*  that could kind of cause the bad bacteria in her gut [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1017.9200000000001s)]
*  to ferment the foods and cause the bloating and leaky gut. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1020.0s)]
*  We basically took out dairy, gluten, grains, sugar, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1023.44s)]
*  processed foods, put her on whole foods, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1027.08s)]
*  anti-inflammatory, microbiome healing diet. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1028.56s)]
*  We gave her, I think I gave her vitamin D, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1031.32s)]
*  fish oils and probiotics, really simple stuff. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1034.24s)]
*  And I said, come back in six weeks [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1037.52s)]
*  and we'll do some diagnostics. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1039.16s)]
*  And in the meantime, do this program and then come back. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1040.4s)]
*  She came back and she said, well, all my symptoms are gone [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1043.1200000000001s)]
*  and I stopped all my medication. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1045.72s)]
*  I'm like, oh, I didn't ask you to stop your medication. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1046.88s)]
*  But she was on Stellara, which costs $50,000 a year. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1049.04s)]
*  It's an immune biologic. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1052.2s)]
*  She was on a host of other drugs from her psychiatrist, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1053.92s)]
*  from her migraine doctor, for her interval valve, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1056.76s)]
*  for her reflux. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1058.76s)]
*  I mean, it was like a whole pile of pills. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1059.6000000000001s)]
*  She was off everything and she had no symptoms [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1061.32s)]
*  and she was all better and she lost 20 pounds. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1063.2s)]
*  And it wasn't an anomaly or a miracle. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1065.8s)]
*  It was just following the principles of how the body works. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1067.92s)]
*  And in that textbook network medicine, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1071.1200000000001s)]
*  they talk about how we need to understand mechanisms [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1073.68s)]
*  and causes, not just symptoms and diagnoses. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1075.6000000000001s)]
*  And we need to understand that there's multi-causality [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1078.8s)]
*  for different problems. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1082.44s)]
*  So it may be not just one thing that causes the disease. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1083.32s)]
*  You might have toxins, it might be your diet, [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1087.44s)]
*  you might have your microbiome issues, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1089.72s)]
*  you might have some other trauma or stress. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1091.92s)]
*  And all those things like kind of are the soup [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1094.88s)]
*  that then breaks the system down so it gets sick. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1097.2s)]
*  And so my job is basically to see where are the things [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1100.92s)]
*  that are broken down and how do I help repair them, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1103.8400000000001s)]
*  how do I remove the root causes, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1105.68s)]
*  whether it's mercury or whether it's mold [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1106.96s)]
*  or whether it's your microbiome having dysbiosis [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1109.24s)]
*  or whether it's a trauma that you should deal with [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1112.0s)]
*  through MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1114.64s)]
*  which hopefully will be passed soon. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1116.28s)]
*  There's all sorts of things to do to help the body, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1118.52s)]
*  but we have to have the framework [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1121.2s)]
*  for having the right assessment of someone, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1122.88s)]
*  otherwise they don't get better. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1124.68s)]
*  And I've had the privilege as working at Canyon Ranch [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1126.32s)]
*  through my own private practice, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1129.6000000000001s)]
*  of doing tens of thousands of dollars of the testing [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1131.0800000000002s)]
*  potentially on tens of thousands of patients over decades [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1133.44s)]
*  and seeing literally millions and millions of data points [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1137.0s)]
*  of their story and their labs [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1138.88s)]
*  and their treatment and their outcomes. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1141.24s)]
*  And so I have this really deep understanding [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1143.52s)]
*  of all the ways in which these systems interact and connect. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1146.28s)]
*  And so I think people can map out [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1149.44s)]
*  what's happening in their biology in ways [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1151.2800000000002s)]
*  that now tell them what's really going on. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1152.48s)]
*  And we're seeing that happening, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1154.0400000000002s)]
*  the testing community is growing [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1155.24s)]
*  and people wanna know what's going on in their bodies [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1156.5600000000002s)]
*  and they're using wearables and they're using CGMs [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1158.96s)]
*  and all kinds of self-diagnostic tools, [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1161.6000000000001s)]
*  which I think are important [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1164.4s)]
*  because people aren't getting the answer [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1165.64s)]
*  from the traditional medical system. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1166.64s)]
*  Well, and a lot of physicians, unlike you, frankly, [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1168.3200000000002s)]
*  don't look very healthy, which people would say, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1172.96s)]
*  okay, well, it shouldn't be about looks, [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1175.4s)]
*  but if I was at the dentist and I look up [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1177.36s)]
*  and my dentist is snaggletoothed and decaying teeth, [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1179.6799999999998s)]
*  doesn't bring me a lot of confidence. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1183.56s)]
*  I look pretty good for 100, huh? [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1185.1999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, you look great and you're super vital. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1186.36s)]
*  I think this idea of systems, biology and health [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1189.4399999999998s)]
*  is really important for people to understand [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1195.04s)]
*  because I always say, well, there are two sayings. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1196.84s)]
*  I didn't say the first. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1200.1999999999998s)]
*  The first one was taught to me when I was a graduate student, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1201.04s)]
*  which is a drug is a substance that when injected [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1203.76s)]
*  into an animal or human produces a scientific paper, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1206.36s)]
*  meaning anytime you manipulate a variable, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1209.32s)]
*  but there are two things that if you, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1212.8s)]
*  oftentimes if you inject a drug at a high enough dose, [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1214.32s)]
*  you'll see an effect. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1217.12s)]
*  If you deprive sleep, you'll see an effect. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1218.8s)]
*  And that points to several things, [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1222.4399999999998s)]
*  but I think both of them have a vector [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1224.12s)]
*  in the direction of this system's biology. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1227.4799999999998s)]
*  If everything modulates everything else, [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1230.6s)]
*  so if your gut is off, it's going to modulate your sleep, [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1233.32s)]
*  which is going to modulate your cognition. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1235.56s)]
*  And if you were to boost your, [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1237.08s)]
*  some vitamin level ridiculously high [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1241.1599999999999s)]
*  or have it ridiculously low, [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1243.84s)]
*  it's involved in thousands of processes in the body. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1245.56s)]
*  And so if you look at any one of those, [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1248.08s)]
*  you might see a subtle effect. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1249.56s)]
*  I think the challenge of reductionist science [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1250.72s)]
*  and reductionist medicine is because the goal [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1252.84s)]
*  in good science is to isolate variables, [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1257.08s)]
*  you can't by definition actually look at a whole system. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1259.6799999999998s)]
*  Although now with AI, maybe you could explore [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1264.08s)]
*  how adjusting one variable impacts pretty much [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1267.0s)]
*  every major system of the brain and body, [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1269.3999999999999s)]
*  but it's just very hard to do. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1271.56s)]
*  And as somebody who's done laboratory science for gosh, [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1272.6799999999998s)]
*  what, over 25 years and instructed other people [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1275.1999999999998s)]
*  how to do it and graduate students and postdocs, [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1278.1999999999998s)]
*  I mean, it's an art, but it's limited [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1280.48s)]
*  in terms of what it can reveal. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1284.6s)]
*  And we work as a system. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1286.9199999999998s)]
*  So I think this is what we're getting at here. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1288.4399999999998s)]
*  So you're saying the scientific process itself [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1290.28s)]
*  precludes us from really understanding things [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1291.96s)]
*  because we can't study things in the way [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1293.6s)]
*  that need to be studied? [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1295.32s)]
*  Well, yeah, let's say you come into my lab [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1296.1999999999998s)]
*  and I wanna study how increasing L-carnitine, for instance, [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1297.6799999999998s)]
*  impacts your mood, immune system function and sleep. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1303.6s)]
*  I can do that study, but even that is just [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1307.24s)]
*  an infinitely complex study. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1310.0s)]
*  I could do dose response, I'll probably do oral [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1311.32s)]
*  versus injectable, and then I can't control, [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1313.12s)]
*  unless it's in laboratory animals [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1315.76s)]
*  on a same genetic background, I can't control [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1317.84s)]
*  whether or not one person's having a Snickers [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1320.48s)]
*  and the other person is having a Snickers [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1322.64s)]
*  and telling me and then one person's lying. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1324.48s)]
*  I mean, it is so hard to do controlled science. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1327.0800000000002s)]
*  So what we end up doing is we end up creating [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1330.1200000000001s)]
*  very artificial environments, very artificial conditions, [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1331.68s)]
*  and isolating variables and outcomes. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1334.6000000000001s)]
*  And at the same time, genomic sequencing, proteomics [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1337.0s)]
*  have allowed us to identify interesting genes [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1341.2s)]
*  that have a potential role in longevity [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1344.1200000000001s)]
*  or stem cells and Yamanaka factors. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1345.68s)]
*  And so I feel like it cuts both ways. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1347.6000000000001s)]
*  And so as a physician, when somebody comes in, [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1349.96s)]
*  and I'm asking this question so that people [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1352.76s)]
*  can think about their own health, [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1354.48s)]
*  if people are feeling not well, where do you start? [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1356.28s)]
*  This thing, where do you start? [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1362.3600000000001s)]
*  You start with how you're sleeping, [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1364.0s)]
*  how you're eating, skin tone. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1365.44s)]
*  I imagine you can look at somebody [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1367.52s)]
*  and kind of get a sense of their vibrancy [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1369.6000000000001s)]
*  at the level of their eyes. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1371.6000000000001s)]
*  Where do you start? [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1372.72s)]
*  I can tell people's blood works, [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1373.5600000000002s)]
*  and it's just by looking at them. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1374.48s)]
*  There you go. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1375.6000000000001s)]
*  So where do you start? [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1376.96s)]
*  What should we, when we look in the mirror in the morning, [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1378.32s)]
*  what are we looking for? [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1382.28s)]
*  I think that's a great question. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1383.96s)]
*  I think that, just to back up one second, [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1384.8s)]
*  I think you talked about putting high dose of something in [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1387.8799999999999s)]
*  or a lack of sleep. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1391.04s)]
*  Functional medicine is about understanding [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1392.52s)]
*  the answer to very simple questions [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1395.6s)]
*  and then designing a treatment model [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1398.08s)]
*  based on the answers to those questions. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1400.6399999999999s)]
*  And the questions are one, what are you exposed to [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1402.76s)]
*  that's interrupting your normal function? [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1406.8s)]
*  Hence functional medicine. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1409.6s)]
*  What is it that's bugging you? [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1410.8s)]
*  What's pissing your system off? [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1412.28s)]
*  And there's a short list, Andrew, it's toxins, [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1414.52s)]
*  and it can be internal endogenous toxins [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1417.16s)]
*  or external toxins like heavy metals or pesticides [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1420.2s)]
*  or glyphosate or a million other things. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1422.72s)]
*  It's infections or microbes. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1425.04s)]
*  So it can be post-COVID syndrome with persistent spike protein. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1427.96s)]
*  It can be Epstein-Barr virus that leads to MS. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1431.76s)]
*  It can be Lyme disease. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1434.6s)]
*  It can be your microbiome being off, [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1437.36s)]
*  which is the truth for most of us. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1438.1599999999999s)]
*  It's allergens, which are things that your body's [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1440.28s)]
*  reacting to, both environmental allergens [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1442.6s)]
*  or it could be food allergens or food sensitivities, [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1444.32s)]
*  which is not truly an allergen, [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1447.12s)]
*  but it's more of an adverse reaction to food [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1448.36s)]
*  from leaky gut. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1450.12s)]
*  It can be poor diet, which I think most of us [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1451.6799999999998s)]
*  understand what that is. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1453.8799999999999s)]
*  It can be stress, and that can be physical, [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1455.0s)]
*  mechanical stress, like being hit by a car, [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1457.56s)]
*  or psychological stress, or the meaning you make [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1459.84s)]
*  from a psychological stress, which is really [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1462.8799999999999s)]
*  what caused you to be sick. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1464.6799999999998s)]
*  I know you've had Gabor on your podcast. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1465.52s)]
*  No, not yet. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1467.6s)]
*  We haven't had Gabor on. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1468.44s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1469.28s)]
*  But we've had a number of people talking about [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1470.12s)]
*  the relationship between mind and body and stress, [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1471.08s)]
*  and certainly it's a profound connection. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1473.2s)]
*  Yeah, so you have this list of five things. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1476.28s)]
*  That interacts with your genome, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1477.8799999999999s)]
*  and it's really what we call the exposome. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1480.24s)]
*  What your genes are exposed to is far more predictive [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1483.76s)]
*  than your genome. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1487.24s)]
*  Your exposome includes some total of everything [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1488.08s)]
*  you're exposed to on the positive and the negative, [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1490.28s)]
*  all the things I just listed, but also all the ingredients [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1492.36s)]
*  for health. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1494.36s)]
*  I identify what are the impediments for health, [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1495.88s)]
*  and then what are the ingredients for health? [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1496.72s)]
*  And the ingredients for health are not complicated. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1498.56s)]
*  We're biological organisms, right? [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1501.0s)]
*  Despite trying to live outside of our biological constraints, [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1502.52s)]
*  we need the right kind of food, right? [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1506.44s)]
*  Whole food. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1508.64s)]
*  What does that look like? [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1509.48s)]
*  Michael Pollan said, eat food, mostly plants, [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1510.3s)]
*  not too much, right? [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1512.88s)]
*  Or not too much, mostly plants, something like that. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1514.44s)]
*  And it's basically eating foods that's as close to nature [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1516.56s)]
*  as you can find it. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1519.6000000000001s)]
*  Grew out of the ground or had a pulse. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1520.76s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, basically right. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1522.6000000000001s)]
*  He says, eat food that's grown in a plant, [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1524.84s)]
*  not made in a plant. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1526.9599999999998s)]
*  And I used to lecture at these churches, [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1527.8s)]
*  and I said, it's really simple to figure out what to eat. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1529.82s)]
*  Ask yourself, did God make it, or did man make it? [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1531.48s)]
*  Did God make it, Twinkie? [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1533.6s)]
*  No. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1534.52s)]
*  Did he make an avocado? [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1535.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1536.1799999999998s)]
*  Would our ancestors recognize it? [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1537.02s)]
*  Yeah, like, would your great-grandmother know [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1537.86s)]
*  what a Lunchable was or a Gogurt was? [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1539.3999999999999s)]
*  So this generally means eating foods [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1541.8s)]
*  that are single ingredient foods, [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1544.3999999999999s)]
*  or foods that combine only single ingredient foods. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1546.36s)]
*  Like you have to go to the label. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1549.8s)]
*  I read the labels. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1551.24s)]
*  You look at it, do I recognize this? [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1552.28s)]
*  Would I have this in my kitchen? [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1554.08s)]
*  Do I have butylated hydroxythiolamine in my kitchen [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1555.76s)]
*  or red dye number three? [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1557.9199999999998s)]
*  Probably not. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1559.1599999999999s)]
*  Right? [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1560.0s)]
*  Unless you're a grandma making cupcakes [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1560.82s)]
*  that are really red. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1562.04s)]
*  But so, food. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1563.6399999999999s)]
*  Fruit, vegetables, meat, fish. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1565.08s)]
*  Fruit, vegetables, yeah. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1567.3999999999999s)]
*  Quality dairy. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1568.72s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I've written so many books on this, [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1569.6399999999999s)]
*  The Pegan Diet, Food But The Heck Should I Eat. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1571.36s)]
*  I wanted to call it Food But The Fuck Should I Eat, [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1573.12s)]
*  but my publisher wouldn't let me. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1574.4399999999998s)]
*  Nowadays they probably would. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1576.28s)]
*  I feel like they curse everywhere. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1577.1599999999999s)]
*  So there's like, we can dive into nutrition, [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1580.12s)]
*  but just assume like you need, [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1582.6s)]
*  depending on your age and your sex [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1584.08s)]
*  and what you're doing with your life, [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1586.0s)]
*  you need the right nutrition of whole real food. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1587.54s)]
*  Can I just ask you, [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1589.56s)]
*  we'll just quickly double click into there. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1590.76s)]
*  What's your view on seed oils? [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1593.2199999999998s)]
*  Oy. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1596.3999999999999s)]
*  No, just, you know, I mean, I'll say mine. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1597.24s)]
*  I like olive oil and butter, coconut oil, [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1598.9599999999998s)]
*  and things like avocados and some Brazil nuts [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1601.6799999999998s)]
*  and walnuts and stuff. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1604.08s)]
*  So since I don't count calories, [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1604.9199999999998s)]
*  I kind of have an intuitive sense of what I'm taking in, [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1607.9199999999998s)]
*  how much fat, how much protein, how much starch, [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1611.4s)]
*  how much, you know, fibers, carbs, et cetera. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1613.2800000000002s)]
*  So for me, like I wouldn't pick canola oil [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1615.52s)]
*  because I could pick olive oil. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1619.0400000000002s)]
*  Then I make sure it's real olive oil. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1621.0800000000002s)]
*  But I don't think seed oils necessarily will kill me, [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1623.72s)]
*  but guess why I know they won't kill me? [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1627.14s)]
*  Because I don't eat them. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1629.26s)]
*  We should be eating whole food fats as much as possible. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1630.2800000000002s)]
*  Avocados, coconut, nuts and seeds, [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1634.0400000000002s)]
*  omega-3 fats from fish, olive oil, [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1637.3200000000002s)]
*  which is the most minimally processed oil you can get, [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1640.04s)]
*  extra virgin olive oil. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1642.76s)]
*  And we're eating nuts and seeds. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1644.24s)]
*  We're getting a lot of omega-6s. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1647.32s)]
*  So the big theory behind seed oils is that it's omega-6 rich. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1648.6s)]
*  It's imbalanced with omega-3s. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1652.32s)]
*  It causes inflammation. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1654.24s)]
*  The way they're produced and grown is problematic. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1656.0s)]
*  There are usually GMO crops like canola oil. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1659.0s)]
*  They spray lots of chemicals on them. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1661.8s)]
*  Those chemicals get in the oil. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1663.24s)]
*  They're manufactured in an industrial way [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1664.8799999999999s)]
*  that oxidizes them, that uses hexane [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1667.04s)]
*  to get rid of some of the compounds in it, [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1669.88s)]
*  deodorizes them, bleaches them, [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1673.24s)]
*  and then they're easily oxidized. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1675.72s)]
*  So would I want to eat an industrial food product? [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1677.52s)]
*  Probably not. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1680.44s)]
*  Do we know for sure that it's a problem? [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1681.52s)]
*  I think the data's mixed. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1683.76s)]
*  There's some studies that show epidemiologically [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1684.96s)]
*  that people who eat more of these plant-based oils [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1687.12s)]
*  or seed oils have reduced risk of diseases. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1690.36s)]
*  So we don't know what they're doing, [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1692.96s)]
*  and there's food frequency questionnaires, [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1694.2s)]
*  and these studies are proving correlation, not causation. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1695.96s)]
*  And what it's replacing. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1698.92s)]
*  Sorry to interrupt here, but I'll see the data [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1699.88s)]
*  that seed oils are better for people than butter. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1703.1200000000001s)]
*  Okay, I like grass-fed butter, but I don't eat it in excess. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1706.16s)]
*  I once joked about that, and I like, well, [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1710.24s)]
*  I made some jokes early on in having a podcast [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1712.64s)]
*  not realizing the implications, but anyway, [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1714.5200000000002s)]
*  I am very careful now. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1717.2800000000002s)]
*  I have some butter in moderation. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1718.88s)]
*  But so I could imagine that if you're eating a lot of lard [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1721.0800000000002s)]
*  and butter and bacon fat and you replace it with seed oils, [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1723.24s)]
*  you'll get healthier. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1725.92s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1727.32s)]
*  Maybe, but you could imagine, [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1728.16s)]
*  I guess it depends on what else you're ingesting, [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1729.44s)]
*  because the starch-fat combination [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1730.96s)]
*  is the one that gets people, in my opinion. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1733.92s)]
*  But right, somebody could be eating a lot of meat and fruit. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1735.96s)]
*  Don't eat your butter with a bagel, [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1739.1200000000001s)]
*  put it on your broccoli. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1741.88s)]
*  Because the saturated-fat, refined-starch combo [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1743.88s)]
*  is what's killing us. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1747.68s)]
*  I wish people would really hear you on this. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1749.44s)]
*  It's not fat per se. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1754.56s)]
*  It's not starches per se. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1757.3600000000001s)]
*  It's the combination of fat and starch, [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1759.1200000000001s)]
*  and in particular, fat, starch, and sugar. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1761.8s)]
*  Yeah, well, starch and sugar. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1764.44s)]
*  Starch and sugar are like below the neck. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1765.52s)]
*  Your body can't tell if it's a bowl of sugar [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1767.3200000000002s)]
*  or a bowl of cornflakes or a bagel or a bowl of sugar. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1768.8s)]
*  So if I put a pat of butter on a bowl of white rice, [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1771.0800000000002s)]
*  is it that bad? [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1774.28s)]
*  No, not really. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1775.68s)]
*  Okay, but if I put a pat of butter on a muffin, [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1776.6000000000001s)]
*  it's bad news bears. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1780.2s)]
*  Yeah, you're doubling down on the sugar, yeah. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1781.04s)]
*  And I think, to answer your question about the CDRL, [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1783.0s)]
*  the data's not really completely answering this. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1786.6399999999999s)]
*  And it's part of the problem of nutrition. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1789.96s)]
*  It's not of nutrition science. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1791.3999999999999s)]
*  The one large randomized controlled trial [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1792.84s)]
*  that was done on like 9,000 people, [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1796.6799999999998s)]
*  not on 90 people or 50 people or 30 people, [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1798.4399999999998s)]
*  which a lot of these studies are, [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1801.56s)]
*  but on 9,000 people that were randomized [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1802.76s)]
*  in a psychiatric hospital, [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1804.96s)]
*  would be unethical to do today. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1807.1599999999999s)]
*  It was done by Ansel Keys. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1808.72s)]
*  It was the mini sort of coronary experiment [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1810.52s)]
*  funded by the NIH, [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1812.16s)]
*  where they basically gave half the group butter [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1813.96s)]
*  and half the group corn oil. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1816.28s)]
*  Now corn oil is a pure omega-6 oil, [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1817.68s)]
*  as opposed to soybean, which is mixed omega-3, [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1820.28s)]
*  canola mixed omega-3, six oils. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1822.88s)]
*  And what they found was striking. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1826.24s)]
*  They found that the group that had the corn oil, [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1828.1200000000001s)]
*  for every 30 point drop in LDL cholesterol, [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1831.48s)]
*  the risk of death from heart attacks or strokes [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1835.84s)]
*  went up by 22%, [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1838.76s)]
*  which is completely the opposite of what we think in medicine, [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1841.0s)]
*  which is LDL is the boogeyman. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1844.04s)]
*  LDL is the bad cholesterol or L for lousy cholesterol. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1846.1599999999999s)]
*  It's not so simple. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1850.36s)]
*  And I think these oversimplification of, [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1851.44s)]
*  let's say these C-dols lower LDL, therefore they're good. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1854.8s)]
*  It's just too simplistic. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1858.32s)]
*  But if, would I, for example, have a corn oil [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1859.84s)]
*  that was expeller pressed or that was organic [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1863.64s)]
*  or canola oil that was, or sunflower or safflower oil? [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1865.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I'm not worried about those in small amounts, [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1868.68s)]
*  but that's not what most people are doing. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1871.4s)]
*  Most people are eating, most of their diet [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1873.44s)]
*  is ultra processed foods, 60% of adults, [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1875.48s)]
*  67% of kids is basically junk food. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1878.2s)]
*  And the major oil in those are these refined oils. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1881.5600000000002s)]
*  So is it the oils, is it the junk food? [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1884.3200000000002s)]
*  They're just a vehicle for this. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1887.2s)]
*  And we've increased our consumption, for example, [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1888.64s)]
*  the main seed oil or bean oil, [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1890.88s)]
*  it's not really a seed, is soybean oil [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1893.12s)]
*  by a thousand fold since 1900. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1896.28s)]
*  Now, I'm sort of an evolutionary thinker. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1898.9599999999998s)]
*  I'm like, how are our bodies designed [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1901.08s)]
*  and what should we be doing with them? [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1904.0s)]
*  And you talk a lot about light, [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1905.6399999999999s)]
*  and that's like, you went to sleep with the sun, [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1907.9199999999998s)]
*  you woke up with the sun. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1910.56s)]
*  It was just how things were. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1911.52s)]
*  And you had circadian rhythms [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1913.0s)]
*  and our whole biological clocks and rhythms [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1914.2399999999998s)]
*  are screwed up because of how we live. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1916.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah, well we evolved under the major constraint [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1917.7199999999998s)]
*  of sunrise and sunset. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1920.12s)]
*  That's right. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1921.56s)]
*  Artificial lighting is a wonderful thing, [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1922.8000000000002s)]
*  but I think there's highly processed light. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1924.8400000000001s)]
*  It's devoid of long wavelengths. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1927.24s)]
*  The eradication basically of incandescent bulbs [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1929.2800000000002s)]
*  and all these LEDs. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1932.0s)]
*  Highly processed light. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1933.44s)]
*  Daylight savings times, it's really messing people up. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1934.48s)]
*  It means, oh, it's just an hour. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1938.68s)]
*  No, actually it's your mental health. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1939.96s)]
*  When it comes to the seed oil thing, [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1942.16s)]
*  I actually predict that seed oils will lose. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1944.3200000000002s)]
*  I think in the end, it's just obvious. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1946.88s)]
*  Why wouldn't people just say, you know what, [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1948.5600000000002s)]
*  the seed oil thing may or may not be a problem. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1950.76s)]
*  I'm just gonna eat olive oil and a little bit of butter. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1953.08s)]
*  Yeah, that's kinda my view. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1954.76s)]
*  It seems so simple to me. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1955.6000000000001s)]
*  That's my view. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1956.44s)]
*  It's kinda my view is if you have a newt nature [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1957.28s)]
*  kind of compound or an unnaturally high amount [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1960.52s)]
*  of something that we're having in our diet, [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1963.84s)]
*  I mean, sugar was always around. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1965.24s)]
*  We would get honey, we would whatever. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1966.56s)]
*  But we'd have 22 teaspoons a year as Hunter gathers. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1968.04s)]
*  Now we have that every day for every American. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1971.68s)]
*  If you had a magic wand and you could get rid of seed oils [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1974.24s)]
*  or you could get rid of highly refined sugars [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1978.08s)]
*  in a modern American diet, which one would you? [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1980.76s)]
*  Yeah, no contest. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1983.36s)]
*  It's starch and sugar that's driving our metabolic crisis. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1984.3999999999999s)]
*  By a huge factor, by a huge factor. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1988.9199999999998s)]
*  Does that mean no pasta, no bread? [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1991.08s)]
*  It doesn't mean no, no anything. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1992.9199999999998s)]
*  It just means the volume of stuff we're eating. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1994.56s)]
*  We're eating pharmacologic doses. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1997.76s)]
*  It's 152 pounds of sugar and 133 pounds of flour, [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=1999.3999999999999s)]
*  which has a higher glycemic index than sugar. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2002.8s)]
*  Really? [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2005.52s)]
*  Yeah, well, that's how it's set. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2006.36s)]
*  It's set at white bread as 100 and the sugar's 80 [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2007.32s)]
*  because it's fructose and glucose. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2010.76s)]
*  So you have to break that apart. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2012.04s)]
*  And so your glycemic load, [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2013.28s)]
*  which is how it affects your blood sugar, [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2015.52s)]
*  fructose doesn't raise your blood sugar, [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2017.4399999999998s)]
*  glucose raises your blood sugar. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2019.28s)]
*  So where do we go wrong? [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2020.6s)]
*  Because I was a teen in the 90s. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2021.6s)]
*  I don't, until I discovered fitness, [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2024.36s)]
*  I didn't eat poorly at home. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2027.56s)]
*  My mom cooked high food. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2030.84s)]
*  I didn't eat Pop Tarts, Kraft Macaroni and cheese. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2031.6799999999998s)]
*  We weren't allowed that stuff. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2033.76s)]
*  Dang, life is margarine. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2035.64s)]
*  We weren't allowed that stuff, [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2037.24s)]
*  but we had our like honey nut Cheerios. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2038.0800000000002s)]
*  That looks like some preserves. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2039.72s)]
*  We had our honey nut Cheerios and things like that, [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2042.0400000000002s)]
*  but we ate mostly whole foods. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2043.72s)]
*  And then not from, there wasn't a whole foods market [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2044.96s)]
*  back then, but whole unprocessed, minimally processed foods. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2047.92s)]
*  But I ate my fair share of pizza slices and burritos [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2050.76s)]
*  in college and stuff like that. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2054.28s)]
*  And I was active, but I wasn't a serious athlete. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2056.44s)]
*  But then somewhere around 2010 forward, [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2059.96s)]
*  I feel like everything, again, just to be very direct, [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2063.6s)]
*  there was probably one kid or two kids in my school [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2067.52s)]
*  that were obese. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2070.08s)]
*  Now, depending on where you live, [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2072.04s)]
*  you see 60, 70, 80% of kids are obese. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2074.64s)]
*  So, I mean, what happened? [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2079.16s)]
*  I wanna answer that, and then I wanna come back [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2081.56s)]
*  to the loop of what I was trying to complete [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2083.3199999999997s)]
*  on the big thought of like, how does the body work [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2085.44s)]
*  and how do you create health and what do you do? [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2087.7999999999997s)]
*  Because you asked me that question, [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2090.08s)]
*  I wanna lose that question. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2091.0s)]
*  What happened was, there was this rise [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2093.64s)]
*  in cardiovascular disease in America, [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2098.36s)]
*  and there was this thought that saturated fat [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2101.0s)]
*  and fat was the bad guy. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2103.7599999999998s)]
*  And this was the McGovern report in the 70s [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2105.7599999999998s)]
*  that went on to be the dietary guidelines, [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2107.64s)]
*  that went on to be the food pyramid. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2109.44s)]
*  And the food pyramid essentially told us [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2111.52s)]
*  that fat was the enemy, so it's only the very tippy top fats [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2113.44s)]
*  and all sparingly. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2116.68s)]
*  Bottom of the pyramid was six to 11 servings [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2118.48s)]
*  of bread, rice, cereal, and pasta a day. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2121.96s)]
*  Which sounds like a recipe for being hungry all the time. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2125.2400000000002s)]
*  And being obese. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2127.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2128.64s)]
*  Now, we didn't know at the time, [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2129.48s)]
*  but it became really clear that that was a bad idea, [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2130.7200000000003s)]
*  pretty quick, and the hockey stick rise in obesity, [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2134.7200000000003s)]
*  type two diabetes tracks perfectly with that information. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2138.48s)]
*  The American public trusted the government, [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2142.68s)]
*  they trusted the scientists, and when they said, [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2144.56s)]
*  fat's bad, carbs are good, everybody listened. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2147.04s)]
*  Eggs are bad. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2151.72s)]
*  Eggs are bad, fat's bad, cholesterol's bad. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2152.68s)]
*  Red meat's bad. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2155.04s)]
*  So people ate less red meat, they ate less eggs, [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2155.8799999999997s)]
*  they ate less fat, and then we got snackable cookies. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2157.52s)]
*  We got low fat ice cream, and the sugar [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2160.4799999999996s)]
*  just went through the roof. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2165.12s)]
*  And so that's when you see this explosive rise. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2166.68s)]
*  And then there's other factors, our microbiome [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2169.64s)]
*  affects our weight, environmental toxins [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2171.52s)]
*  affect our metabolism, so there's a whole bunch [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2173.8799999999997s)]
*  of things happen in tandem, but that probably [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2176.2s)]
*  is the single biggest thing. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2179.3199999999997s)]
*  So if someone asks me for me, should I worry about [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2180.24s)]
*  soybean oil or sugar and starch? [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2182.8799999999997s)]
*  It's 100% sugar and starch. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2185.2799999999997s)]
*  I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2187.56s)]
*  one of our sponsors, Function. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2189.3599999999997s)]
*  I recently became a Function member after searching [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2191.52s)]
*  for the most comprehensive approach to lab testing. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2193.7999999999997s)]
*  While I've long been a fan of blood testing, [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2196.8399999999997s)]
*  I really wanted to find a more in-depth program [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2198.64s)]
*  for analyzing my blood, urine, and saliva [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2200.9199999999996s)]
*  to get a fuller picture of my heart health, [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2203.8399999999997s)]
*  my hormone status, my immune regulation status, [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2205.6s)]
*  my metabolic function, my vitamin and mineral status, [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2208.68s)]
*  and other critical areas of my overall health and vitality. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2212.2799999999997s)]
*  Function not only provides testing of over 100 biomarkers [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2215.52s)]
*  key to physical and mental health, [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2218.7999999999997s)]
*  but it also analyzes these results [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2220.72s)]
*  and provides insights from top doctors. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2222.6s)]
*  For example, in one of my first tests with Function, [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2225.12s)]
*  I learned that I had an elevated level [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2227.68s)]
*  of mercury in my blood. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2229.2799999999997s)]
*  Function not only helped me detect that, [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2230.68s)]
*  but also offered insights on how to best reduce [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2232.72s)]
*  my mercury levels, which included limiting [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2234.8399999999997s)]
*  my tuna consumption. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2236.84s)]
*  And frankly, I had been eating a lot of tuna at that time [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2238.2400000000002s)]
*  while also making an effort to eat more leafy greens [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2240.6800000000003s)]
*  and supplementing with NAC and acetylcysteine, [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2243.2000000000003s)]
*  both of which can support glutathione production [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2245.52s)]
*  and detoxification. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2247.56s)]
*  And by the way, it worked. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2249.08s)]
*  My mercury levels are now well within healthy range. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2250.7400000000002s)]
*  Comprehensive lab testing like that is super important [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2253.6400000000003s)]
*  for health because basically a lot of things are going on [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2256.08s)]
*  in our blood and elsewhere in our body [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2258.96s)]
*  that we can't detect without a quality blood and urine test. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2260.76s)]
*  And while I've strived to get those tests for many years, [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2264.28s)]
*  it's always been overly complicated [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2266.86s)]
*  and frankly, quite expensive. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2268.6600000000003s)]
*  Function dramatically simplifies all of it [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2270.32s)]
*  and makes it very affordable. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2272.84s)]
*  I've been so impressed by Function [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2274.52s)]
*  that I decided to join their scientific advisory board. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2275.92s)]

*  Today's episode is also brought to us by Roka. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2303.5200000000004s)]
*  I'm excited to share that Roka and I recently teamed up [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2306.1200000000003s)]
*  to create a new pair of red lens glasses. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2308.48s)]
*  These red lens glasses are meant to be worn in the evening [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2311.42s)]
*  after the sun goes down. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2313.84s)]
*  They filter out short wavelength light [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2315.44s)]
*  that comes from screens and from LED lights, [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2317.1200000000003s)]
*  which are the most common indoor lighting nowadays. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2319.36s)]
*  I want to emphasize Roka red lens glasses [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2321.98s)]
*  are not traditional blue blockers. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2323.98s)]
*  They do filter out blue light, [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2326.16s)]
*  but they filter out a lot more than just blue light. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2327.58s)]
*  In fact, they filter out the full range [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2329.7400000000002s)]
*  of short wavelength light [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2331.66s)]
*  that suppresses the hormone melatonin. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2332.98s)]
*  By the way, you want melatonin high in the evening [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2334.9s)]
*  and at night, makes it easy to fall and stay asleep. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2337.14s)]
*  And those short wavelengths trigger increases in cortisol. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2339.82s)]
*  Increases in cortisol are great [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2343.76s)]
*  in the early part of the day, [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2345.34s)]
*  but you do not want increases in cortisol [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2346.52s)]
*  in the evening and at night. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2348.58s)]
*  These Roka red lens glasses ensure normal healthy increases [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2349.86s)]
*  in melatonin and that your cortisol levels stay low, [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2353.1800000000003s)]
*  which is again, what you want in the evening and at night. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2356.2200000000003s)]
*  In doing so, these Roka red lens glasses [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2359.38s)]
*  really help you calm down [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2361.46s)]
*  and improve your transition to sleep. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2362.7400000000002s)]
*  Roka red lens glasses also look great. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2364.9s)]
*  They have a ton of different frames to select from [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2366.94s)]
*  and you can wear them out to dinner or concerts [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2368.9s)]
*  and you can still see things. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2371.1800000000003s)]
*  I don't recommend you wear them while driving [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2372.2200000000003s)]
*  just for safety purposes, [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2373.8s)]
*  but if you're out to dinner, you're at a concert, [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2375.34s)]
*  you're at a friend's house, or you're just at home, [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2377.02s)]
*  pop those Roka red lens glasses on [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2379.06s)]
*  and you'll really notice the difference [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2380.68s)]
*  in terms of your levels of calm [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2381.94s)]
*  and all the sleep stuff I mentioned earlier. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2383.58s)]
*  So it really is possible to support your biology, [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2385.86s)]
*  be scientific about it and remain social at the same time, [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2388.22s)]
*  if you like. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2391.7999999999997s)]
*  If you'd like to try Roka, go to roka.com, [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2392.7799999999997s)]

*  So the 90s low fat thing. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2405.46s)]
*  Yeah, was a disaster. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2408.14s)]
*  And I wrote a book called Eat Fat Get Thin [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2410.1s)]
*  where I cataloged the whole history of how we got there [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2411.7799999999997s)]
*  and what the problems were and what the science [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2414.66s)]
*  is telling us about what we should be eating, [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2416.2599999999998s)]
*  about the reconsidering saturated fat being bad. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2417.7799999999997s)]
*  It's bad if you're eating it in the context [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2420.5s)]
*  of starch and sugar. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2422.7s)]
*  For most people, it's not. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2424.1s)]
*  And if you're obese or metabolically unhealthy, [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2425.3799999999997s)]
*  it actually can be better for you. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2427.7799999999997s)]
*  There's a lower risk of diabetes [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2429.54s)]
*  and epidemiological studies with butter and milk fat. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2431.54s)]
*  So I think we have to kind of like, [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2435.3399999999997s)]
*  I know nutrition's a very complicated subject, but. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2437.42s)]
*  Or not, right? [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2440.2200000000003s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2441.26s)]
*  I mean, do you think that nutrition [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2442.1s)]
*  is a very straightforward subject? [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2443.1800000000003s)]
*  It should be, it should be. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2444.78s)]
*  Yeah, and I confess, I've had some pretty [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2446.06s)]
*  diametrically opposed views from guests on this podcast. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2447.94s)]
*  We had Robert Lustig on the podcast, [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2450.82s)]
*  we had Lane Norton on the podcast. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2452.34s)]
*  You get those two on separate podcasts [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2453.86s)]
*  and they are like at loggerheads with one another, right? [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2455.7400000000002s)]
*  Now, Lane's correct in that total caloric load matters. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2458.94s)]
*  It's not everything, but it matters. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2463.3s)]
*  I would say many people have a hard time [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2465.46s)]
*  limiting their intake of starchy carbohydrates, [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2468.34s)]
*  especially if you put a little bit of fat on there. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2471.26s)]
*  It just becomes a different food entirely. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2474.26s)]
*  Eating a bowl of white rice is pretty tasty. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2477.02s)]
*  Eating a bowl of white rice with a pat of butter [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2479.62s)]
*  and a little bit of salt on there [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2481.58s)]
*  is a completely different experience. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2482.78s)]
*  A piece of sourdough bread, it's one thing. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2484.7400000000002s)]
*  A piece of sourdough bread soaked in a little bit [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2487.14s)]
*  of olive oil with some salt, I'm eating half the loaf. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2488.9s)]
*  Pretty good, pretty good. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2491.34s)]
*  And I have pretty good self control. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2492.18s)]
*  So this is where I think the debates [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2493.98s)]
*  have become almost silly. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2497.02s)]
*  And I appreciate that you're being very direct with us here. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2498.6200000000003s)]
*  So take us back. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2500.78s)]
*  So you said they're ingredients for health [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2502.38s)]
*  and they're impediments to health. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2503.98s)]
*  So the ingredients for health are, again, [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2505.2200000000003s)]
*  not a long list because we're human beings. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2508.02s)]
*  We need the right food, we need the right amount [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2509.34s)]
*  of nutrients and it's different for different people. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2511.7000000000003s)]
*  You might not know this, but Bruce Ames did [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2514.1400000000003s)]
*  an incredible paper who recently died, [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2515.7400000000002s)]
*  one of the giants of science, saying that one third [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2518.06s)]
*  of our entire DNA codes for enzymes. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2520.46s)]
*  All enzymes require cofactors. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2522.5s)]
*  Most cofactors are vitamins and minerals. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2525.1s)]
*  And there's a huge genetic variability [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2528.42s)]
*  in how much different people need. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2530.1s)]
*  Some people need 1,000 units of vitamin D, [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2531.46s)]
*  some people need 5,000. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2533.06s)]
*  Some people need 400 micrograms of folate. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2534.86s)]
*  Some people need 4,000 micrograms of folate. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2537.74s)]
*  And so he kind of explained that very carefully. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2540.66s)]
*  So you have to find the right amount of nutrients for you. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2542.54s)]
*  You need the conditionally essential nutrients [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2544.02s)]
*  so people don't think are absolutely essential [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2545.74s)]
*  but things like CoQ10 and various things [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2547.74s)]
*  that the body requires that we may not get enough. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2549.82s)]
*  Then you need light, you need water, [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2552.1s)]
*  you need clean air, you need movement, you need rest. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2554.7s)]
*  And I would say that in the parasympathetic state, [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2559.18s)]
*  kind of what I mean by rest, you need sleep, [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2561.46s)]
*  you need connection, love, meaning, purpose. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2563.9s)]
*  These are all ingredients for health. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2567.38s)]
*  And any one of those can make you sick, [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2569.2599999999998s)]
*  whether it's just being isolated and alone [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2571.42s)]
*  or not having a purpose in your life. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2573.38s)]
*  If you have meaning and purpose in your life, [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2574.62s)]
*  there's a gem of paper published [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2576.38s)]
*  that you're likely to have seven years longer. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2577.54s)]
*  Now, if you cut out all cancer and heart disease [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2581.1s)]
*  from the face of the planet, [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2583.74s)]
*  the extension of life expectancy, seven years. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2585.18s)]
*  The mind is incredible. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2587.62s)]
*  I have a colleague at Stanford who works [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2588.74s)]
*  in the sleep division, sleep medicine. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2590.06s)]
*  And he said, and I shouldn't tell people this [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2593.2999999999997s)]
*  because everyone's supposed to get enough sleep, right? [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2595.1s)]
*  But he said, if you positively, they've done, [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2596.94s)]
*  he has a study that shows that if you positively [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2599.14s)]
*  anticipate next day events, [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2601.66s)]
*  your sleep need is actually reduced pretty substantially. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2603.66s)]
*  And the quality of sleep that you get is remarkable. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2606.9s)]
*  Well, that's why I slept so good last night. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2610.1800000000003s)]
*  I was looking forward to this. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2611.38s)]
*  Exactly, well, these small things, right? [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2612.2200000000003s)]
*  Because we all know the experience of like, [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2613.94s)]
*  I only slept five hours, but I got this thing today, [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2615.2200000000003s)]
*  I'm really looking forward to you, you feel great. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2616.98s)]
*  And so I don't think people should only sleep five hours [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2618.9s)]
*  once people need more than that. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2621.1s)]
*  So the idea is basically with functional medicine, [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2622.3s)]
*  you take out the bad stuff and you put in the good stuff. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2623.7400000000002s)]
*  And each person has a different set of bad stuff [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2626.34s)]
*  and a different set of good stuff. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2628.34s)]
*  And you have to be detective. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2629.98s)]
*  And it's the opposite of traditional medicine, [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2631.1s)]
*  which is just use a single drug to treat a single mechanism [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2633.58s)]
*  with a single disease in a single outcome. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2637.7000000000003s)]
*  You have high blood pressure, [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2639.42s)]
*  take a high blood pressure drug to lower your blood pressure. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2640.98s)]
*  We need multimodal treatments for multi-causal diseases. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2643.94s)]
*  And so what English that means is we need to do [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2648.1400000000003s)]
*  a lot of different things. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2650.82s)]
*  Like if you want a garden, you don't just say, [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2651.98s)]
*  I'm gonna put the plant in the air and not water it [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2654.6200000000003s)]
*  and not give it soil. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2658.9s)]
*  Or you're saying, I'm just gonna plant it in the soil, [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2660.42s)]
*  but no light and no water. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2662.1000000000004s)]
*  I mean, and this is the way science is. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2664.3s)]
*  I remember trying to do a study on Alzheimer's [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2667.38s)]
*  at Cleveland Clinic and the top scientist there was like, [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2668.58s)]
*  we wanted to study this multimodal dimensional approaches [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2671.3s)]
*  to call it a black box approach. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2673.58s)]
*  Everybody's getting a different treatment. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2676.02s)]
*  It's super personalized, customized [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2677.18s)]
*  based on their own unit biology. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2678.66s)]
*  There's no one such thing as Alzheimer's [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2680.2599999999998s)]
*  or different Alzheimer'ses, I don't know if that's a word, [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2681.7s)]
*  but you know what I mean? [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2684.22s)]
*  And that's why we fail so miserably [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2685.46s)]
*  with the amyloid hypothesis [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2686.86s)]
*  because we're just looking at the end stage phenomenon, [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2688.02s)]
*  which is plaque going into an area that's inflamed [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2690.54s)]
*  to kind of deal with the inflammation. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2693.7s)]
*  And so what caused the inflammation is really the question [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2696.7s)]
*  and it can be variable things. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2698.8999999999996s)]
*  So we start to kind of map these out [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2699.74s)]
*  and when you do that and you actually get to the root causes [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2701.62s)]
*  and you try to treat all the things [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2706.14s)]
*  that are out of balance, people get better. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2707.3799999999997s)]
*  So if you have a vitamin D deficiency [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2710.02s)]
*  and a folate deficiency and you have tons [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2711.62s)]
*  of small bowel overgrowth and you have heavy metals [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2714.8599999999997s)]
*  and you have all these different problems, [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2717.1s)]
*  you can't just treat one thing [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2718.7s)]
*  and expect the person to get better. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2719.8599999999997s)]
*  You've got to look at all those things [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2721.5s)]
*  and some are more primary, some are secondary, [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2722.8199999999997s)]
*  and you've got to look at the job [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2725.06s)]
*  of a functional medicine doctor. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2725.9s)]
*  It's a detective. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2726.74s)]
*  And for me what's exciting is, you said, [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2727.74s)]
*  how many people do this? [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2730.06s)]
*  Not that many. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2731.14s)]
*  How many people are experts who've done this for decades [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2732.1s)]
*  and have seen thousands of patients? [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2735.34s)]
*  A few hundred. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2737.86s)]
*  Wow. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2738.86s)]
*  We've trained 100,000 people. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2739.7s)]
*  We have 3,500 I think certified, [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2741.74s)]
*  another I think 3 or 4,000 in the pipe to be certified. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2744.62s)]
*  Not that many people who can do this. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2748.54s)]
*  And this part of the why I created this company [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2750.94s)]
*  called Function Health which you've been so supportive of, [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2753.58s)]
*  which is to allow people to understand [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2756.7799999999997s)]
*  what's going on in their own biology, [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2758.46s)]
*  to be empowered to be the CEO of their own health [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2759.66s)]
*  and to get the data that's gonna help them identify [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2761.86s)]
*  the different things that are going on [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2763.9s)]
*  to actually do something about it. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2765.58s)]
*  Before we move to health metric monitoring, [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2766.7799999999997s)]
*  I do want to ask about ingredients for health. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2771.1s)]
*  You talk about them. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2774.02s)]
*  They're your protocols. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2774.86s)]
*  You don't use that framing, but that's the framing. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2775.7s)]
*  It's take out the bats and put in the good stuff. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2778.46s)]
*  The body knows what to do. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2780.02s)]
*  It's got an innate healing system. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2780.86s)]
*  Just give it a chance. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2782.86s)]
*  I think what's so terrible about traditional medicine, [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2784.6200000000003s)]
*  it has many wonderful features, [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2788.1800000000003s)]
*  is that at least the way it's communicated in this country [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2789.6600000000003s)]
*  is that it assumes that people are lazy [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2794.1800000000003s)]
*  and uninterested in their own health. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2796.06s)]
*  And I fundamentally disagree. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2797.42s)]
*  Hence this podcast, your podcast, et cetera. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2798.98s)]
*  I agree too. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2801.34s)]
*  I believe people want and are willing [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2802.1800000000003s)]
*  to take care of themselves if they know how. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2804.26s)]
*  Okay, so let's just assume that the pillars of health, [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2806.54s)]
*  right, like sleep, sunlight, exercise, [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2808.7000000000003s)]
*  nutrition, social connection, stress modulation, microbiome, [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2812.7s)]
*  et cetera, okay. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2816.5s)]
*  Assuming that people are making some effort [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2817.7s)]
*  to do those things correctly or a lot of effort, [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2819.58s)]
*  what are some of the things that you believe [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2822.5s)]
*  cannot be accessed through diet and behaviors [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2825.9399999999996s)]
*  that warrant supplementation? [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2831.8999999999996s)]
*  And I've been interested in supplements [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2834.74s)]
*  and taking supplements for 35 years. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2836.3799999999997s)]
*  So to me, when people say, [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2838.06s)]
*  oh, supplements aren't regulated, [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2839.4199999999996s)]
*  actually they are regulated to some extent, right? [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2840.8599999999997s)]
*  Like they're monitored. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2842.94s)]
*  You want to find ones that are third party tested. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2845.66s)]
*  Indeed, there are a lot of junk supplements out there. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2848.22s)]
*  There are probably a lot of supplements that don't do much. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2850.06s)]
*  There are probably a lot of supplements [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2851.98s)]
*  that are only use cases for certain people [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2853.02s)]
*  who have a major deficiency. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2855.66s)]
*  But what are some of the things [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2857.2599999999998s)]
*  that are just very difficult to get from food and from sun? [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2858.7s)]
*  Because we hear the soil's depleted magnesium, [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2864.42s)]
*  it's hard to get enough D3. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2868.62s)]
*  If you were to list out, let's just say about 10 things [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2870.86s)]
*  that you feel like, listen, [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2873.1s)]
*  you probably could get it from food, [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2874.78s)]
*  but it's just hard to get these micronutrients. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2876.3s)]
*  What are those things? [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2878.2200000000003s)]
*  And by the way, folks, this is not a preloaded conversation. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2879.3s)]
*  We've never had this conversation. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2881.8s)]
*  I know what I take, but I'm just curious, [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2883.5s)]
*  what would you, because people will try hard [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2884.86s)]
*  to get things from food. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2887.3s)]
*  But what are the things that they can't get from food [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2889.1800000000003s)]
*  or can't get from food easily [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2891.86s)]
*  that you believe everyone should take? [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2893.34s)]
*  Great question. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2895.1800000000003s)]
*  I thought you were going somewhere else. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2896.02s)]
*  I thought you were going where, [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2896.86s)]
*  what are the things that if you did everything perfectly [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2898.2200000000003s)]
*  and you're still sick, what do you do? [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2899.74s)]
*  Oh, well, we'll get to that. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2900.9799999999996s)]
*  We'll get to that. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2902.2999999999997s)]
*  There's a list of those things. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2903.14s)]
*  80% of it you can take care of, [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2903.9599999999996s)]
*  but there's some things you need help with. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2905.7799999999997s)]
*  We can talk about that. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2907.7799999999997s)]
*  I think because of how dramatically our diets changed [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2908.8999999999996s)]
*  after the Industrial Revolution [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2912.9799999999996s)]
*  and because of urbanization [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2914.4599999999996s)]
*  and our disconnection from nature, [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2916.58s)]
*  we have a lower nutrient intake [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2918.9399999999996s)]
*  than we did as hunter-gatherers. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2921.18s)]
*  I just came back from Africa and went to the Hadza tribe, [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2923.3799999999997s)]
*  which is one of the last hunter-gatherer tribes, [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2925.9799999999996s)]
*  and I got to spend a few days with them. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2927.7s)]
*  The nutrient density of the diet was so much higher. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2929.46s)]
*  Omega-3s and vitamin D are outside [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2932.46s)]
*  running around on a loincloth, [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2934.2999999999997s)]
*  or if you're not, you're living in some coastal area [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2935.42s)]
*  where you're eating extremely fatty fish, [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2937.86s)]
*  which is one of the great sources of vitamin D in the food. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2939.46s)]
*  They were eating phytochemicals at an incredible rate [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2943.14s)]
*  through eating 800 different species of plants. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2945.86s)]
*  Now we have three main ones, [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2948.5s)]
*  and 12 of them are altogether comprised [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2950.48s)]
*  probably 95% of our diet instead of 800 plants [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2953.7799999999997s)]
*  with all kinds of phytochemicals and vitamins and minerals. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2956.66s)]
*  The soils we're growing food in [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2959.98s)]
*  have depleted the organic matter [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2962.02s)]
*  because of industrial farming and soil erosion, [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2963.8199999999997s)]
*  and the organic matter, the living soil, [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2966.54s)]
*  is what actually helps to allow the plants [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2968.7799999999997s)]
*  to take up the nutrients from the soil [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2972.2599999999998s)]
*  so that there's a symbiotic relationship [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2974.6s)]
*  between organisms in the soil and the plant, [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2975.98s)]
*  and it uses them to help get nutrients free [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2979.06s)]
*  so they get into the plants, [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2981.66s)]
*  where there's less magnesium, there's less zinc, [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2983.18s)]
*  there's less all these things in our diet. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2984.86s)]
*  And when you look at the surveys of the American population, [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2986.7000000000003s)]
*  there's an ongoing government survey [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2989.78s)]
*  called the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2991.2200000000003s)]
*  It essentially goes around the country with vans, [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2994.26s)]
*  has people's blood all the time, [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2996.5s)]
*  and this is like decades old survey, [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2997.6800000000003s)]
*  and it's incredible because you get all this data. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=2999.7000000000003s)]
*  They find that like 90 plus percent are low in omega-3s, [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3001.7000000000003s)]
*  probably 80% are insufficient or low in vitamin D, [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3005.5s)]
*  50 something percent are magnesium deficient, [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3009.02s)]
*  about the same iron, zinc a little bit less, [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3012.78s)]
*  selenium a little bit less, [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3016.1400000000003s)]
*  and it depends on where you live and what you do, [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3017.34s)]
*  and also within your diet, [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3018.9s)]
*  and what your stage of life is, [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3021.26s)]
*  and what your age is, and how your absorption is. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3022.92s)]
*  For example, when you're older, [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3024.6000000000004s)]
*  you get decreased ability to absorb nutrients, [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3026.6200000000003s)]
*  and decreased ability to absorb, for example, vitamin B12, [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3028.98s)]
*  so at different ages you might need different things. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3031.8s)]
*  And so what are the basics that I think everybody should take? [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3034.98s)]
*  I think everybody should take omega-3 fats, [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3038.1600000000003s)]
*  at least a gram or two of EPA DHA. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3041.0s)]
*  Most people need between two to 4,000 [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3043.16s)]
*  international units of vitamin D3. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3045.04s)]
*  I think a good multivitamin [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3047.6s)]
*  can cover the rest for most people, [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3049.36s)]
*  and when I say good multivitamin, [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3051.36s)]
*  I mean the right bioavailable forms of nutrients. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3052.66s)]
*  I was in the hospital recently for back surgery, [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3056.44s)]
*  and this resident came by and he was attending, [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3059.0s)]
*  saying, I think I need some magnesium [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3062.8s)]
*  because I'm taking all these painkillers for my surgery, [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3065.8s)]
*  and I don't want to be constipated. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3069.0s)]
*  He said, oh, you can get this one. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3071.04s)]
*  I'm like, I said, that's magnesium oxide. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3072.16s)]
*  That's not well absorbed, and it's not the greatest for- [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3073.92s)]
*  Any magnesium citrate? [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3076.84s)]
*  Yeah, so I said, and he was like, [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3077.8s)]
*  oh, that's really interesting, I didn't know that. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3079.44s)]
*  He wrote it down. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3080.76s)]
*  I have a lot of friends who are physicians, [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3083.04s)]
*  and I'll tell you, they come to me for health advice, [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3084.56s)]
*  so that tells you something. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3086.96s)]
*  I'm not an MD. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3088.48s)]
*  Yeah, folks, magnesium citrate, great laxative, [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3089.44s)]
*  malate for muscles, glycinate, [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3094.24s)]
*  and threonate for brain and sleep. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3096.48s)]
*  And glycinate for also, if you're not, [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3099.68s)]
*  tend to be constipated, it's one that you can tolerate [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3102.7599999999998s)]
*  and not be constipated. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3104.72s)]
*  It also helps with detoxification and sleep [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3105.56s)]
*  and other things. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3107.52s)]
*  And so those are the big ones. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3108.3599999999997s)]
*  And I think, I've been diagnostically testing people [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3110.68s)]
*  for decades on nutritional testing. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3114.12s)]
*  With Function, we do deep nutritional tests, [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3115.8799999999997s)]
*  including omega-3 testing and homocysteine, [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3117.7999999999997s)]
*  looking at methylation, which is a really important thing [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3120.6s)]
*  you've talked about in the podcast, B12, folate, B6. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3122.6s)]
*  We do vitamin D testing, [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3125.04s)]
*  and we've seen over 67% are deficient, [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3126.44s)]
*  and this is important to understand, Andrew, [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3129.76s)]
*  67% are deficient at the minimum level [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3131.6800000000003s)]
*  to prevent a deficiency in disease. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3134.52s)]
*  Not the optimal level that you might think is good, [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3136.4s)]
*  like vitamin D over 45, or ferritin, iron store over 45. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3138.6400000000003s)]
*  They're like, oh, if your vitamin is 30 or more, you're okay. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3142.6400000000003s)]
*  Or if you're ferritin 16 or more, you're okay. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3145.36s)]
*  Well, if you're ferritin 16, you're gonna be tired, [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3147.32s)]
*  you're gonna have brain fog, [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3150.0800000000004s)]
*  you're gonna potentially have hair loss, [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3150.92s)]
*  you're gonna have insomnia, [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3152.52s)]
*  and that's just having low iron stores. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3154.0s)]
*  And so when we're looking at that, [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3156.44s)]
*  we're seeing what an incredibly depleted population we are [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3159.2400000000002s)]
*  in terms of the nutrients we have. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3163.48s)]
*  So I wish we wouldn't need them, [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3165.2s)]
*  and I wish we didn't need them, [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3167.68s)]
*  but the fact is that unless we're eating [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3169.48s)]
*  a very structured diet, and I had a patient once [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3171.76s)]
*  who was at OCD, and she's like, [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3173.96s)]
*  I don't wanna take any vitamins. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3175.2400000000002s)]
*  I said, okay, this is about, I'm gonna eat, [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3177.2s)]
*  I know there's, pumpkin seeds have zinc, [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3179.08s)]
*  so I'm gonna have like 14 pumpkin seeds a day, [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3181.36s)]
*  and I need 200 micrograms of selenium, [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3184.4s)]
*  so I'm gonna take four Brazil nuts a day, [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3187.36s)]
*  and she went on, and I'm like, I know I need this nutrient, [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3189.36s)]
*  so I'm gonna have this much liver a day. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3191.7200000000003s)]
*  And so she was able to figure it out, [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3193.56s)]
*  but it's not easy, no. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3195.96s)]
*  So it sounds like magnesium, getting a gram of EPA omega-3, [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3198.2000000000003s)]
*  3,000 IU minimum of D3 per day, [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3203.56s)]
*  some iron, some zinc, selenium, [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3208.1200000000003s)]
*  sounds like the basics. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3210.36s)]
*  And would that be true for teens? [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3211.96s)]
*  For example, you're an older guy, [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3215.2000000000003s)]
*  you don't wanna take a lot of iron, [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3216.48s)]
*  because you're not getting ready bed, [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3217.36s)]
*  and you can get iron toxicity, [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3218.76s)]
*  so if you're a menstruating woman, you need more iron. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3220.0s)]
*  But what I think is the key is figuring out [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3222.6s)]
*  what's right for you. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3224.52s)]
*  Tests don't guess. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3225.44s)]
*  Most people don't know, and some people may need [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3226.44s)]
*  10,000 units of vitamin D to get the same blood level [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3229.48s)]
*  as somebody else with 1,000, [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3232.48s)]
*  and that's because there's different vitamin D receptors, [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3233.76s)]
*  and they're genetically determined, [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3235.6s)]
*  and you can't know by just guessing. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3236.8s)]
*  I totally agree, but I also totally know [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3239.6s)]
*  that a lot of people won't blood test. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3242.7599999999998s)]
*  So the argument against supplements has always been, [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3245.48s)]
*  you just are creating expensive urine, [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3250.36s)]
*  which is a silly one, [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3253.08s)]
*  because that's based on water-soluble vitamins only. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3255.16s)]
*  And by the way, it's a stupid argument, [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3258.56s)]
*  because you're like, why drink water? [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3260.24s)]
*  I just pee the rest out. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3261.44s)]
*  I mean, like, why I'm creating? [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3262.68s)]
*  It's a silly one. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3265.44s)]
*  But the list that we just talked about, [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3266.3199999999997s)]
*  D3 omega, magnesium, maybe some iron, [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3268.56s)]
*  if you're not an older guy, zinc selenium, [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3271.4s)]
*  it seems to me those would be good things [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3274.96s)]
*  for most everybody to add to their already healthy diet [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3277.12s)]
*  that has enough prebiotic, postbiotic fiber. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3282.0s)]
*  And we're seeing iodine, interestingly, [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3285.16s)]
*  because people are eating the iodized salt. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3286.52s)]
*  So they're having sea salt and Himalayan salt. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3289.0s)]
*  We got too fancy with our salt. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3291.2799999999997s)]
*  And so we're taking- We need table salt. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3292.72s)]
*  We're not eating iodized salt. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3293.96s)]
*  Now, iodine is not normally found in salt, [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3295.84s)]
*  but it was added to salt as a fortification [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3297.68s)]
*  to prevent goiters or thyroid problems. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3299.7599999999998s)]
*  But a lot of people have thyroid issues. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3302.3599999999997s)]
*  One in five women and one in 10 men [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3303.8799999999997s)]
*  have low thyroid function, and 50% are not diagnosed. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3306.7599999999998s)]
*  And sometimes just a little iodine supplementation can help. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3310.2s)]
*  Or you can eat seaweed or fish. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3312.24s)]
*  But a lot of people don't eat seaweed or fish. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3316.3599999999997s)]
*  So that's how you would get iodine otherwise. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3318.52s)]
*  So I think people need to kind of figure out [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3321.8399999999997s)]
*  what's going on with themselves [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3323.7999999999997s)]
*  and based on their diet and their preferences. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3324.8799999999997s)]
*  If you're a vegan, I mean, I think [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3326.7599999999998s)]
*  we're seeing tremendous deficiencies in vegans [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3329.8s)]
*  if they're not supplemented. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3332.52s)]
*  We hear a lot nowadays about methylated B12. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3334.48s)]
*  I decided to just start taking methylated B12. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3338.28s)]
*  Is there a danger to taking methylated B12 [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3340.96s)]
*  if you quote unquote don't need it, [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3343.4s)]
*  if you're not a poor methylater? [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3345.48s)]
*  It depends on what you're taking. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3347.08s)]
*  Mostly not, but you can over-methylate or under-methylate. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3348.12s)]
*  And so you don't wanna be doing too much of either of the other. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3351.72s)]
*  And there's genetics that are involved [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3354.96s)]
*  in actually assessing how your methylation pathways work. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3356.96s)]
*  So the genetics are on B12, around B6, around folate. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3360.08s)]
*  And you have multiple genes [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3363.2400000000002s)]
*  that regulate all these different pathways. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3364.76s)]
*  So it depends is the answer. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3367.48s)]
*  But for most people taking a good multivitamin, [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3370.64s)]
*  and when I say good, I mean, [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3372.92s)]
*  it doesn't have any fillers or binders or additives. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3374.48s)]
*  It's not blue. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3376.84s)]
*  It doesn't have titanium dioxide in it. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3378.16s)]
*  It has forms of the nutrients [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3380.84s)]
*  that actually can get utilized. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3382.88s)]
*  It's more embedded by the body. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3384.16s)]
*  We talked about magnesium oxide versus glycinate or citrate. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3385.24s)]
*  And that you make sure the company has integrity, [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3389.44s)]
*  that they've third-party tested for the purity [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3393.2799999999997s)]
*  and the potency, meaning if it says 1,000 units [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3395.4s)]
*  on the label, it's 1,000 units, not 10,000 or 2,000. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3397.44s)]
*  And then it hasn't had any cross-contamination [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3401.0s)]
*  with additives or chemicals. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3403.0s)]
*  So sometimes you get something [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3404.48s)]
*  when an herbal product comes from China, [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3405.6s)]
*  the company didn't realize it was full of lead or whatever. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3407.08s)]
*  Now we're seeing all these plant proteins with lead in them. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3410.4s)]
*  I wanna make sure that we talk about the impediments, [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3413.84s)]
*  things like mold, air, water, cleanliness, [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3416.0s)]
*  things of that sort. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3420.36s)]
*  But I wanna spend just a little bit longer [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3422.32s)]
*  on this supplement thing, [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3425.28s)]
*  maybe because it's so near and dear to my heart. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3428.52s)]
*  And because it has sparked a lot of confusion for me, [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3430.92s)]
*  not supplements per se, but the reaction to them. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3433.7200000000003s)]
*  By traditional medicine? [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3437.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3438.6000000000004s)]
*  Why is it [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3439.7200000000003s)]
*  that supplementation has received so much pushback [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3441.88s)]
*  from the medical community? [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3448.2000000000003s)]
*  And yet I would argue that since 2020, [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3449.52s)]
*  you're going to find vitamin D3 and omegas, [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3454.04s)]
*  essential fatty acids and magnesium [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3458.6s)]
*  in many, many more people's kitchens, [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3461.6s)]
*  meaning they're taking it, than prior to that. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3465.92s)]
*  And this reminds me of yoga, resistance training. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3468.68s)]
*  Yoga was for yogis, resistance training was for bodybuilders [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3473.4s)]
*  and people in the military. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3476.2s)]
*  Now everybody knows, men and women, [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3477.12s)]
*  maybe even young people should do it, [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3479.7599999999998s)]
*  is there some argument that they should? [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3481.16s)]
*  I have my thoughts about young people lifting really heavy, [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3483.7599999999998s)]
*  but in any case, the breath work, [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3486.16s)]
*  there's a lot of science now, meditation, [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3489.68s)]
*  there's tons of science. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3491.68s)]
*  So these things that at one point were considered niche, [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3493.24s)]
*  biohacking, woo and unsafe, [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3496.12s)]
*  inevitably have seemed to become mainstream. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3500.52s)]
*  And I think supplements is starting to happen now. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3504.92s)]
*  Yeah, well it was interesting, [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3507.7599999999998s)]
*  when I got to Cleveland Clinic in 2014, [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3508.68s)]
*  I said, let's do a survey with 3,000 physicians. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3511.16s)]
*  Let's do a survey of the physicians about their beliefs, [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3514.64s)]
*  practices, desires, goals, needs around supplements. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3517.84s)]
*  I was shocked, we got a lot of answers. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3523.48s)]
*  And I'm not remembering the exact percentages, [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3526.28s)]
*  but I'll give you the sort of ballparks. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3529.2000000000003s)]
*  Do you take supplements yourself? [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3533.2000000000003s)]
*  Like over 70% of the doctors did. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3534.36s)]
*  Do you recommend supplements to your patients? [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3536.8s)]
*  Probably like 20% or less did. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3538.7200000000003s)]
*  Would you like to have a source where you knew the quality [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3541.4s)]
*  and had recommendations about the safety? [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3544.08s)]
*  Yes, we desperately wanna do that. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3546.1200000000003s)]
*  Would you prescribe them to your patients more if you did? [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3547.6000000000004s)]
*  Yes, and it's used, [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3550.1200000000003s)]
*  if you look at every medical specialty, [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3551.48s)]
*  cardiologists are using CoQ10 and fish oil, [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3553.76s)]
*  and you've got gastroenterologists using probiotics, [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3557.6s)]
*  and obviously OB-GYNs recommend supplements [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3560.08s)]
*  for prenatal vitamins, [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3561.92s)]
*  and you've got pediatricians recommending [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3563.2400000000002s)]
*  certain vitamins for kids. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3565.76s)]
*  So you look across all the specialties, [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3567.44s)]
*  and you're like, well they're already kind of integrated, [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3569.2400000000002s)]
*  kind of on the margins, but integrated into their practices. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3572.8s)]
*  I think this is kind of a weird thing, [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3575.92s)]
*  where you go to a conference, [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3577.2400000000002s)]
*  and I would do this, doctor, how many people recommend [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3578.2s)]
*  supplements to their patients? [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3580.6s)]
*  And you know, a few hands would go up. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3581.48s)]
*  How many of you guys take supplements [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3582.48s)]
*  that like most of the audience would raise their hand? [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3584.0s)]
*  And I thought that was so peculiar, [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3586.36s)]
*  because in medicine we're told, [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3587.68s)]
*  from a scientific perspective, [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3590.36s)]
*  that they're probably expensive urine, [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3592.36s)]
*  and yet most doctors personally [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3595.48s)]
*  want to take them for themselves. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3598.6s)]
*  That says a lot. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3600.6s)]
*  It does say a lot. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3601.52s)]
*  And I think we're entering an era [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3602.48s)]
*  where I think there's more and more science, [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3603.68s)]
*  we're understanding more about the complexity [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3605.2799999999997s)]
*  of individuality and biochemical individuality, [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3606.7999999999997s)]
*  and this personalized precision medicine, [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3611.32s)]
*  this is where we're all headed, right? [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3613.0s)]
*  And one of the fathers of sort of the thinking [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3614.48s)]
*  in functional medicine was Roger Williams, [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3617.44s)]
*  who discovered pantothenic acid or vitamin B5. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3619.28s)]
*  He wrote a book called Biochemical Individuality. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3622.56s)]
*  And actually his book was the one [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3624.56s)]
*  that got me interested in this in college, [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3626.36s)]
*  because I lived with a nutrition PhD student [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3627.84s)]
*  who was talking about basically the gut flora of cows, [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3630.0s)]
*  which he was studying to understand fiber and the microbiome, [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3633.16s)]
*  and he gave me a book called Nutrition Against Disease [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3636.16s)]
*  by Roger Williams. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3638.44s)]
*  This is like in 1980. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3640.2799999999997s)]
*  And I read it and I was like, oh wow, [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3642.12s)]
*  this is nutrition, it's such an important thing. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3643.52s)]
*  So I think doctors are beginning to understand [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3645.4399999999996s)]
*  the value of nutrition, the value of nutritional [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3647.08s)]
*  sort of supplements, the value of testing for nutrients. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3650.08s)]
*  It's still slow, but I think we're gonna get there. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3653.3999999999996s)]
*  There's a whole generation of physicians and scientists [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3657.8399999999997s)]
*  that I do think in the current shift in funding for science, [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3661.0s)]
*  different conversation entirely, are going to retire. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3665.72s)]
*  I'm not sure it's a bad thing. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3670.3599999999997s)]
*  I don't mind saying this. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3671.7999999999997s)]
*  I don't mind saying it. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3673.24s)]
*  I think they've done a really wonderful job [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3674.9199999999996s)]
*  and now it's time to pass the baton. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3676.7999999999997s)]
*  The younger generation and the forward thinking, [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3679.2s)]
*  people in their 60s and 70s are changing the game. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3683.8799999999997s)]
*  It's a very different game now. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3687.72s)]
*  And I think it's hard for them to understand that. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3689.4399999999996s)]
*  And it's gotta be scary, [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3692.8399999999997s)]
*  but the younger generation is much more versed. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3696.24s)]
*  I actually would like your reflections on something. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3700.04s)]
*  For someone that's listening to this conversation [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3701.88s)]
*  and you think, oh goodness, now I have to buy organic foods [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3704.08s)]
*  and buy all these supplements. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3706.7599999999998s)]
*  And let's say somebody has a limited budget. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3708.2799999999997s)]
*  Do you think it's fair to say, [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3711.12s)]
*  okay, if you have a limited budget, [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3712.64s)]
*  you would be very wise to get cardiovascular exercise [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3714.12s)]
*  at least three days a week, do some resistance training, [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3717.7599999999998s)]
*  which can be done with body weight. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3720.56s)]
*  And could you say, eat eggs, fish, meat, [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3721.8399999999997s)]
*  fruits and vegetables? [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3725.2s)]
*  Nuts and sweets and olive oil. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3726.76s)]
*  And you're there. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3728.6000000000004s)]
*  And if you look at the cost of buying food out [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3730.0400000000004s)]
*  versus that, you're probably coming out ahead. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3732.48s)]
*  Cause I'm thinking about the college student. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3734.44s)]
*  I'm thinking about me in college or as a postdoc [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3736.4s)]
*  or a graduate student. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3738.84s)]
*  So I think for people that have more disposable income, [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3740.32s)]
*  it makes sense. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3744.2000000000003s)]
*  You eat as well as you can, organic, you supplement, [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3745.48s)]
*  you blood test. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3747.96s)]
*  And I wanna talk about those things. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3749.5200000000004s)]
*  Let's talk about some of the impediments. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3751.1600000000003s)]
*  And I do wanna keep budgetary restraints in mind [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3752.64s)]
*  because I think people fall into the category of poor, [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3757.08s)]
*  some disposable income and lots of disposable income. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3759.72s)]
*  And all too often in the bio hacking sphere, [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3764.44s)]
*  we're talking about that last category. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3768.08s)]
*  And we don't wanna lose anyone along the way. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3770.4s)]
*  So air, we had fires here in Los Angeles. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3773.24s)]
*  It was dreadful. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3778.2999999999997s)]
*  The beach now all the way down to Marina Del Rey, [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3779.3599999999997s)]
*  I ran down there yesterday, [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3783.4s)]
*  it was completely littered with chunks of charcoal. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3784.24s)]
*  They mow it under the sand. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3787.08s)]
*  It's going out to ocean. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3788.8s)]
*  Most people don't listen to this, [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3791.7599999999998s)]
*  probably don't live in Los Angeles. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3793.32s)]
*  How bad is our air in the United States, [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3794.8s)]
*  Northern Europe, Australia? [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3798.7599999999998s)]
*  Is there any clean air left? [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3801.04s)]
*  I mean, yeah, maybe in the mountains in Colorado. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3802.6s)]
*  Okay, so the air is dirt. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3806.12s)]
*  I think, compared to what is the answer? [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3807.48s)]
*  If you go to India or China [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3810.08s)]
*  or some of these developing nations [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3812.7200000000003s)]
*  are not even developing anymore, the air is so bad. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3814.36s)]
*  I mean, they have all kinds of petrochemical products [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3818.2000000000003s)]
*  they burn, they have coal factories. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3821.96s)]
*  I mean, it's really bad. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3824.6800000000003s)]
*  So in America, I think the air quality in general [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3826.7200000000003s)]
*  is much, much higher. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3828.6800000000003s)]
*  I think when you have things like wildfires, [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3830.2400000000002s)]
*  it's a different ballgame. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3831.84s)]
*  Then just the wood smoke itself, [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3832.8s)]
*  if it's just a tree's burning is bad enough, [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3835.48s)]
*  but then you burning houses and batteries and plastics [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3837.6s)]
*  and you've got PFAS chemicals. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3840.64s)]
*  And we actually found that those chemicals go up [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3843.16s)]
*  on their function testing in people living in LA [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3846.44s)]
*  who've actually been in the fires. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3848.2s)]
*  Yeah, I need to get tested again [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3849.7999999999997s)]
*  because I haven't been tested since the fires. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3851.68s)]
*  I mean, I feel fine. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3853.72s)]
*  But I got out of town, I drove up to San Luis Obispo, [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3854.96s)]
*  parked myself at a big pink hotel called the Madonna Inn [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3857.84s)]
*  and looked at the horses and worked on my book. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3862.7599999999998s)]
*  That's good. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3865.44s)]
*  The air felt clean, but is the air clean [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3866.72s)]
*  when there isn't a fire? [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3869.7599999999998s)]
*  I mean, not necessarily. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3871.56s)]
*  I mean, for example, and it just helps people understand [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3872.3999999999996s)]
*  that air moves. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3874.9199999999996s)]
*  It's not like there's just LA air or Colorado air. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3877.16s)]
*  In Seattle, they had a big mercury problem in the air [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3882.52s)]
*  because of China, because Northeast China, [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3886.08s)]
*  like Beijing and Harvard, in the winters, [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3889.0s)]
*  they just burn huge amounts of coal [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3891.08s)]
*  and it goes up in the air and it goes across [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3892.8799999999997s)]
*  in the Gulf Streams and the air streams, [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3896.16s)]
*  whatever they call them, [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3898.36s)]
*  and it gets all the way to Seattle [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3900.12s)]
*  and it rains heavy metal rain. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3901.76s)]
*  And so no matter where you live, [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3904.2000000000003s)]
*  you're kind of exposed to the collective air. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3906.0s)]
*  There's some for sure areas that are much cleaner, [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3909.04s)]
*  but I think that most people, [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3911.2000000000003s)]
*  if they have an air filter in your house [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3912.88s)]
*  where you spend most of your time, you're probably okay. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3914.0s)]
*  So is it a separate unit air filter? [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3916.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3918.7200000000003s)]
*  You can get one for your house, [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3919.68s)]
*  which most houses have, make sure you change the filters, [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3920.92s)]
*  or you can get a special HEPA air filter [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3923.2s)]
*  if you live in a more urban area [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3925.4399999999996s)]
*  or more environmentally toxic area. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3927.3199999999997s)]
*  I love to exercise outside, [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3929.56s)]
*  is running and breathing harder outside. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3931.3999999999996s)]
*  In LA? [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3933.48s)]
*  Well, I like to do that wherever I go, [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3934.3199999999997s)]
*  but when I'm in New York City, [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3936.96s)]
*  I love to run along the freeway. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3939.2799999999997s)]
*  Probably breathing in a lot of junk. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3942.9199999999996s)]
*  You are, yeah. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3944.3999999999996s)]
*  I mean, and the question is, [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3945.24s)]
*  what's gonna be a problem for you? [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3946.4399999999996s)]
*  Like all of us are toxic soups, right? [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3948.4399999999996s)]
*  So it's just the amount over time that builds up [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3950.2799999999997s)]
*  and then eventually sometimes things can happen. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3953.44s)]
*  It causes cardiovascular disease, [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3954.92s)]
*  it causes dementia, it causes cancer, [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3956.7200000000003s)]
*  it causes diabetes. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3959.36s)]
*  So toxins are direct causes of these things, [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3960.6000000000004s)]
*  among other things, diet and other things. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3962.56s)]
*  So I think you can't go crazy about it. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3963.92s)]
*  I mean, we're living in the 21st century, [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3966.2000000000003s)]
*  we are where we are unless you wanna move [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3968.56s)]
*  to some remote island in the South Pacific or something. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3969.88s)]
*  Iceland's looking pretty nice. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3972.4s)]
*  Iceland's looking good, yeah. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3973.92s)]
*  I mean, Greenland seemed to be the 51st state. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3975.2000000000003s)]
*  Maybe. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3978.2400000000002s)]
*  Is that gonna happen? [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3979.08s)]
*  I don't know, I'm just joking. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3979.92s)]
*  I'm making fun of it. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3982.04s)]
*  But I mean, there are places, [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3983.04s)]
*  but I think for most of us, we have to just manage it. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3985.04s)]
*  And we filter our water. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3988.44s)]
*  I wouldn't drink tap water. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3990.36s)]
*  There's an average of 37 or eight wastewater contaminants, [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3991.88s)]
*  including drugs, including pesticides, including glyphosate. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3995.16s)]
*  I mean, in hormones, if women are taking the pill [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=3998.68s)]
*  or taking hormone replacement therapy, where does that go? [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4003.32s)]
*  There's some amount that gets excreted in the urine, [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4006.0s)]
*  it goes into the water treatment plants. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4007.8s)]
*  They don't filter that stuff out. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4009.28s)]
*  I mean, they get the bugs out, [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4010.56s)]
*  but you're getting all that stuff in your water. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4012.7599999999998s)]
*  So having a reverse osmosis water filter is a good idea. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4014.64s)]
*  But I think the cost thing is really important, Andrew. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4017.36s)]
*  I think one of the problems people think about [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4019.2s)]
*  is that, oh, it's expensive to be healthy. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4022.7599999999998s)]
*  And I think that's a myth. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4024.92s)]
*  I think you mentioned a lot of foundational things [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4026.08s)]
*  like eating real food, exercising, getting up sleep, [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4028.44s)]
*  managing stress, breath work. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4031.0s)]
*  These are things that are free. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4032.36s)]
*  Your breath is free. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4033.2799999999997s)]
*  You can move your body. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4034.96s)]
*  You can do body weight if you can't even afford bands. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4036.48s)]
*  Food is interesting because the food industry [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4039.64s)]
*  has been very good at brainwashing Americans [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4042.68s)]
*  that they need highly processed, cheap junk food. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4045.52s)]
*  Not accounting for the actual cost of that food, [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4050.3599999999997s)]
*  which is $3 for every $1 you spend on that food. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4052.3599999999997s)]
*  You're gonna spend $3 in collateral damage to your health, [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4055.12s)]
*  to the economy, to the environment, to social fabric. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4057.7599999999998s)]
*  I mean, this is a Rockefeller report [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4059.8799999999997s)]
*  on the true cost of food. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4061.2s)]
*  But if you actually just look at the actual price [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4063.52s)]
*  of the food, if you eat real food, [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4065.4s)]
*  it doesn't have to be expensive. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4067.7599999999998s)]
*  Now you might not be getting a $70 ribeye [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4070.0s)]
*  that's grass-fed from New Zealand. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4071.4s)]
*  You might be getting short ribs [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4073.56s)]
*  that aren't organic or grass-fed. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4075.8s)]
*  That's okay. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4077.84s)]
*  Whole grains, beans. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4079.1600000000003s)]
*  I mean, I grew up poor and we used to have liver and onions. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4080.8s)]
*  It's just like the cheapest. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4087.52s)]
*  I mean, I'm not. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4088.84s)]
*  And that's chicken liver. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4089.6800000000003s)]
*  Chicken liver, yeah. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4090.6000000000004s)]
*  Chicken, chopped liver, what are you gonna say? [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4091.56s)]
*  Chicken liver not for me. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4093.88s)]
*  There's been studies that it may cost the same [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4095.52s)]
*  for maybe 50 cents extra a day to eat well. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4097.8s)]
*  And there's a guide from the environmental working group [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4099.76s)]
*  called Good Food on a Tight Budget, [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4101.52s)]
*  which is how to eat well for you [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4103.0s)]
*  and for your wall and the planet. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4104.400000000001s)]
*  And we grew up, we have borscht, like it was short ribs, [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4105.96s)]
*  which is like the cheapest kind of meat. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4110.24s)]
*  Onions, cabbage, carrots, tomato, canned tomatoes. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4112.2s)]
*  It's pretty darn cheap. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4116.84s)]
*  And you can feed a family of like six for a few bucks. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4118.4400000000005s)]
*  And there's been a lot written about this, [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4122.4800000000005s)]
*  but the food industry's great at convincing us [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4124.4800000000005s)]
*  that it's elitist, that it's expensive, [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4126.16s)]
*  that it's all very organic. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4128.2s)]
*  Forget about organic, non-organic, regenerative, [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4129.72s)]
*  non-regenerative. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4131.72s)]
*  If you don't have a lot of resources, [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4132.72s)]
*  just focus on eating real food [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4134.639999999999s)]
*  and you will do better and feel better [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4136.68s)]
*  and be more productive [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4138.92s)]
*  and walk around not feeling like crap. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4139.8s)]
*  Do you think that one of the reasons food and nutrition [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4142.16s)]
*  is so complicated in this country [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4144.84s)]
*  is that with the exception of the hamburger, [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4146.88s)]
*  the hot dog, apple pie, and ice cream, [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4148.68s)]
*  that there isn't really an American cuisine. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4153.2s)]
*  What's wrong with all that? [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4156.44s)]
*  Years ago- [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4157.28s)]
*  Hot dogs, hamburgers, apple pies. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4158.12s)]
*  Right, well years ago, [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4159.5599999999995s)]
*  I had a girlfriend who was from the south of France. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4160.8s)]
*  She grew up very modestly, did not have wealth at all. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4166.68s)]
*  But her family ate very well. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4173.08s)]
*  They put a lot of effort into food. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4175.2s)]
*  They put a lot of time into food. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4176.639999999999s)]
*  They had gardens, they had animals. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4177.48s)]
*  And she knew about, she was in her early 20s, [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4178.32s)]
*  I was in my mid 20s then, [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4180.88s)]
*  she knew probably 200 recipes for soups and soufflés. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4183.32s)]
*  I mean, it was amazing. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4189.24s)]
*  I ate very well. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4191.92s)]
*  So I feel like one of the things [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4193.04s)]
*  that's really missing in this country [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4194.16s)]
*  is a sense of pride in the healthy food [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4196.02s)]
*  that we can produce here. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4198.16s)]
*  And there's never really been a history of it. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4199.4800000000005s)]
*  We have kind of a picture of the farmer and the rancher. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4202.0s)]
*  And then on the west coast, [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4205.36s)]
*  you have more of the kind of like natural food movement [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4206.4800000000005s)]
*  or the healthy food movement, [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4209.04s)]
*  Alice Waters and Michael Pollan and that kind of thing. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4211.48s)]
*  But that's considered kind of hippie dippy. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4213.68s)]
*  I lived in Berkeley, so I can say that. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4215.24s)]
*  And so, and they've made great effort [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4217.08s)]
*  to try and popularize that. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4218.84s)]
*  But I think that's one of the reasons [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4221.28s)]
*  that we've commoditized food now. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4222.76s)]
*  And so American food is junk food, cotton candy. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4225.06s)]
*  It's true. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4227.96s)]
*  What happened was, and it was after the World War II, [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4228.8s)]
*  and because my mother and grandparents [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4233.24s)]
*  were pre that generation. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4235.04s)]
*  So they had an incredible food culture. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4236.36s)]
*  And my grandmother tells me stories, [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4239.84s)]
*  or told me stories, she died, [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4242.04s)]
*  of plucking chickens at the local butcher [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4243.4400000000005s)]
*  so she could get a nickel to go to the movies. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4246.6s)]
*  But I feel like that came by way of people's ethnic past [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4248.96s)]
*  because they were first and second generation immigrants. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4251.4400000000005s)]
*  Fair enough, fair enough. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4253.52s)]
*  But still, what happened was the industrialization [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4254.360000000001s)]
*  of the American food system. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4255.72s)]
*  So after World War II, [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4256.64s)]
*  there was all these bomb making factories [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4258.6s)]
*  and all these biochemical, biological warfare factories. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4260.12s)]
*  So they got turned into bomb factories, [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4263.4800000000005s)]
*  got turned into fertilizer, which was nitrogen. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4265.64s)]
*  And the biological weapons were pesticides and herbicides. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4268.16s)]
*  So basically pesticides are biological weapons. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4273.4s)]
*  They're neurotoxins. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4275.84s)]
*  That's how they killed the insects. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4276.84s)]
*  They spore sterilized them. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4278.599999999999s)]
*  And then we thought everything industrial is good. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4279.599999999999s)]
*  Remember in the 60s, you probably remember, [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4282.16s)]
*  they had better living through chemistry through DuPont [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4283.68s)]
*  and didn't realize it was killing everybody, right? [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4285.96s)]
*  And the World's Fair, and I grew up in Queens, [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4288.4s)]
*  and the World's Fair was in Queens in 1965, [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4290.88s)]
*  and I went, and I didn't obviously remember that skit, [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4293.4s)]
*  but I've seen things about it. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4296.08s)]
*  So the industrialization of the food supply, [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4297.8s)]
*  the agricultural industrialization with mechanization, [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4301.08s)]
*  the destruction of the soil, [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4304.88s)]
*  the overgrowing of starchy carbohydrate crops [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4306.04s)]
*  to feed a growing hungry world, we wanted that. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4309.400000000001s)]
*  Like we now produce 500 calories more per person in America [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4312.68s)]
*  than we actually need to eat. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4315.64s)]
*  And we export a lot of that. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4317.4400000000005s)]
*  So the industrialization was a thing. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4319.24s)]
*  And then in the 50s, the food industry started [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4321.6s)]
*  to make a lot of processed food. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4323.96s)]
*  And they were completely taken off guard [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4326.08s)]
*  because there's this woman named Betty, [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4328.8s)]
*  who was a home ec teacher, [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4330.24s)]
*  who was part of the federal extension workers, [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4332.64s)]
*  that was paid for federal program [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4334.5599999999995s)]
*  to send people out to young families, [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4337.6s)]
*  to teach the mothers how to, [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4340.28s)]
*  and it was sexist because it was the mothers, [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4341.5199999999995s)]
*  how to cook and how to garden [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4343.5199999999995s)]
*  and how to grow their own food [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4345.6s)]
*  and how to be independent and how to eat real, [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4346.76s)]
*  it was like really great. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4348.5599999999995s)]
*  And there was a big meeting in Minnesota around that time, [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4350.0s)]
*  Stone and Mills sponsored, [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4355.0s)]
*  but all the big food companies came [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4356.28s)]
*  and they decided convenience had to be king [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4357.88s)]
*  and we had to make that a value. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4359.92s)]
*  They invented Betty Crocker, not a real person, [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4361.48s)]
*  Betty Crocker cookbook, you might remember that cookbook, [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4364.6s)]
*  but it was like, oh, add one can of Campbell's cream [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4366.68s)]
*  of mushroom soup to your casserole [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4368.84s)]
*  or add one roll of Crits crackers to your broccoli casserole. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4370.72s)]
*  So they insinuated that and there were TV dinners [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4374.68s)]
*  and I grew up in that area. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4376.88s)]
*  And then there was like, the food of astronauts, [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4377.72s)]
*  like tang and flesh, mince, margarine, better than butter. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4380.36s)]
*  And so it was cup of noodles. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4383.36s)]
*  So we basically got this whole culture of like convenience [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4385.6s)]
*  and then you deserve a break today from McDonald's. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4387.72s)]
*  We basically disenfranchised people from their kitchens. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4389.92s)]
*  We have a whole generation of Americans [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4392.52s)]
*  who don't know how to cook, [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4394.76s)]
*  who don't know anything about shopping [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4396.04s)]
*  or where vegetables come from. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4397.52s)]
*  I mean, Jamie Oliver did a whole television show series [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4398.8s)]
*  in West Virginia where kids didn't know what a tomato was [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4401.0s)]
*  and they saw a tomato or a carrot [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4404.2s)]
*  or they couldn't name a vegetable, right? [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4405.96s)]
*  Because they had never seen one. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4407.360000000001s)]
*  And now most of America is like that. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4409.16s)]
*  And so they have succeeded in disenfranchising ourselves [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4411.16s)]
*  from our kitchen. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4415.52s)]
*  They've hijacked our kitchens, our brain chemistry, [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4416.360000000001s)]
*  our metabolism, our hormones. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4418.8s)]
*  We need to take it back. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4420.56s)]
*  And it's like the body snatchers. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4421.52s)]
*  Like we really need to take our bodies back, [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4422.96s)]
*  own our own biology, understand that we're in charge, [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4425.280000000001s)]
*  understand that we shouldn't abdicate our health [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4427.64s)]
*  to anybody else, including the doctor. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4429.200000000001s)]
*  You have a doctor as a partner, as an advisor, [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4431.320000000001s)]
*  as a collaborator, but like they're not God [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4433.72s)]
*  and they don't know everything. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4436.200000000001s)]
*  And now with the advent of self testing, [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4437.280000000001s)]
*  like function health is like $1.37 a day. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4440.12s)]
*  It's still money, but it's affordable for most people. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4442.96s)]
*  And our- [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4445.64s)]
*  It's a lot less than a latte. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4446.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, it's like, and we do $15,000 for the test [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4447.4800000000005s)]
*  for 4.99 a year. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4449.68s)]
*  And you get a panel of tests [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4451.64s)]
*  that tells you what's really happening [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4453.4800000000005s)]
*  and people can own their data and own their biology [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4454.64s)]
*  and be proactive and preventative [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4456.88s)]
*  and actually understand what's happening [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4458.84s)]
*  way before they get into real trouble. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4460.64s)]
*  I'd like to take a quick break [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4463.28s)]
*  and acknowledge our sponsor, AG1. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4464.4400000000005s)]
*  AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4466.96s)]
*  that also contains adaptogens. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4469.52s)]
*  I started taking AG1 way back in 2012, [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4471.52s)]
*  long before I even knew what a podcast was. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4474.160000000001s)]
*  I started taking it and I still take it every single day [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4476.64s)]
*  because it ensures that I meet my quota [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4479.52s)]
*  for daily vitamins and minerals. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4481.280000000001s)]
*  And it helps make sure that I get enough prebiotics [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4482.72s)]
*  and probiotics to support my gut health. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4485.52s)]
*  Over the past 10 years, gut health has emerged [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4488.0s)]
*  as something that we realize is important, [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4490.080000000001s)]
*  not only for the health of our digestion, [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4491.88s)]
*  but also for our immune system [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4493.92s)]
*  and for the production of neurotransmitters [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4495.360000000001s)]
*  and neuromodulators, things like dopamine and serotonin. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4497.56s)]
*  In other words, gut health is critical [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4500.88s)]
*  for proper brain function. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4502.56s)]
*  Now, of course, I strive to eat healthy whole foods [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4504.36s)]
*  from unprocessed sources [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4506.28s)]
*  for the majority of my nutritional intake, [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4507.4800000000005s)]
*  but there are a number of things in AG1, [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4509.56s)]
*  including specific micronutrients [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4511.04s)]
*  that are hard or impossible to get from whole foods. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4512.92s)]
*  So by taking AG1 daily, [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4515.64s)]
*  I get the vitamins and minerals that I need, [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4517.56s)]
*  along with the probiotics and prebiotics for gut health [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4519.400000000001s)]
*  and in turn, brain and immune system health [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4522.2s)]
*  and the adaptogens and critical micronutrients [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4524.28s)]
*  that are essential for all organs and tissues of the body. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4527.04s)]
*  So anytime somebody asks me [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4530.0s)]
*  if they were to only take one supplement, [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4531.4s)]
*  what that supplement should be, [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4533.16s)]
*  I always say AG1, [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4534.72s)]
*  because AG1 supports so many different systems [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4536.16s)]
*  in the brain and body that relate to our mental health, [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4538.4s)]
*  physical health and performance. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4540.76s)]
*  If you'd like to try AG1, [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4542.84s)]

*  along with a bottle of vitamin D3 plus K2. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4553.96s)]
*  As I've highlighted before in this podcast, [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4557.16s)]
*  Omega-3 fish oil and vitamin D3 plus K2 [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4558.92s)]

*  Again, that's drinkag1.com slash Huberman [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4568.16s)]
*  to get the free one month supply of Omega-3 fish oil [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4571.4s)]
*  plus a bottle of vitamin D3 plus K2 [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4574.2s)]
*  with your subscription. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4576.64s)]
*  The confusion for me has been the pushback [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4578.12s)]
*  on self-directed health. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4581.28s)]
*  You know, I had something come to mind [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4583.88s)]
*  as you were saying all this, [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4586.92s)]
*  which is that I do believe that until health [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4587.76s)]
*  becomes a point of national pride for Americans, [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4592.24s)]
*  that we're going to become the sickest nation in the world. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4595.68s)]
*  No, we are, really. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4597.92s)]
*  You know, well, we're going to continue to be, right? [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4598.76s)]
*  But there's this thing that happens [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4601.6s)]
*  when you start taking care of your health. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4603.08s)]
*  And I know this because in college, [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4604.320000000001s)]
*  I decided to stop drinking [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4605.64s)]
*  as much as everyone else around me drank. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4608.16s)]
*  It was insane. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4609.76s)]
*  It was unbelievable, the amount of binge drinking [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4611.400000000001s)]
*  and just the frequency, like Wednesday, Thursday, Fridays. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4613.6s)]
*  I was like, this is crazy. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4616.56s)]
*  And I got really into working out and sleep and studying. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4617.76s)]
*  And, you know, I had to be a bit lonely [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4620.76s)]
*  in order to preserve that life, [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4622.92s)]
*  but I got teased a lot for being healthy. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4624.200000000001s)]
*  But the point being that it still takes some [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4627.240000000001s)]
*  self-confidence, rigidity, and kind of determination [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4632.84s)]
*  to push off the people like, [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4638.120000000001s)]
*  oh, it's so self-focused to, you know, [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4639.4400000000005s)]
*  focus on your health. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4641.56s)]
*  You know, you're spending money on these, [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4642.84s)]
*  on vitamin D3, you know, [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4644.48s)]
*  or, oh, you can't have a slice of pizza. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4647.16s)]
*  It's like, no, you can, but the point is, [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4648.919999999999s)]
*  maybe you don't want to [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4651.0s)]
*  because you have a certain amount of self-pride, [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4651.839999999999s)]
*  not because pizza can't be amazing. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4654.5199999999995s)]
*  There are some amazing pizzas, by the way, [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4656.16s)]
*  but most pizza's crap and some pizza's amazing. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4657.879999999999s)]
*  And it's worth it to wait for the amazing pizza, [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4660.679999999999s)]
*  in my opinion. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4662.4s)]
*  So I guess the idea here is what we really need, it seems, [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4663.24s)]
*  is it's kind of a psychological, cultural, [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4667.96s)]
*  medicine revolution, and true revolution, [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4672.84s)]
*  given the way things are going with the obesity rates. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4676.72s)]
*  And so I do want to talk about Maha, [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4678.96s)]
*  make America healthy again. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4682.4800000000005s)]
*  I'm not formally involved in Maha. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4683.92s)]
*  I know people involved in it. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4686.400000000001s)]
*  Know people who know people who know people. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4688.8s)]
*  I know people who know people, [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4690.16s)]
*  and I am in discussions with them. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4691.28s)]
*  They've asked questions. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4693.6s)]
*  I've provided answers where I could provide answers. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4694.56s)]
*  But the pushback on Maha is what I'd like to understand [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4696.96s)]
*  because you and I sit from a unique vantage point [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4700.32s)]
*  and you in particular, where you have a lot of colleagues [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4702.2s)]
*  and understanding of the traditional medical community. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4704.639999999999s)]
*  So as they always say, that's not the guy you gotta get. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4707.76s)]
*  You don't need to get the guy that's watching podcasts [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4710.72s)]
*  and taking supplements. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4713.32s)]
*  But what about the guy or gal who is like, [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4715.88s)]
*  I don't know, my doctor says this is crazy. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4718.96s)]
*  They want to get rid of vaccines, [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4721.12s)]
*  and they want everyone doing pushups. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4722.96s)]
*  God forbid if everybody did pushups. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4724.5599999999995s)]
*  They don't want to take a Zempik. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4726.32s)]
*  And so maybe, because I see you, Mark, [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4728.2s)]
*  as somebody who can potentially bridge this divide. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4730.88s)]
*  Knowing people on both sides, [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4734.8s)]
*  I really see you as somebody who can do that. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4736.0s)]
*  I'm not saying that just because you're sitting here, [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4737.24s)]
*  and large part you're sitting here because of that. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4738.8s)]
*  So how do you change millions of people's mindset [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4741.84s)]
*  about health when now Maha has become a red label thing? [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4746.24s)]
*  How do you do it? [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4750.84s)]
*  Either Republicans are gonna get healthy [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4751.68s)]
*  and Democrats aren't. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4753.72s)]
*  It's crazy to me. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4754.56s)]
*  Or there's an opportunity here. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4756.28s)]
*  And I do think that, [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4757.64s)]
*  I know they're drawing you in for this, [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4759.4800000000005s)]
*  and I'm so glad they are, [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4761.400000000001s)]
*  because I do think that you're somebody [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4763.200000000001s)]
*  who really believes in inclusivity [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4764.84s)]
*  in the real sense of the word. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4767.360000000001s)]
*  So what do you think it's gonna take [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4769.0s)]
*  to make America healthy? [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4770.320000000001s)]
*  And this is not Maha propaganda. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4772.200000000001s)]
*  This is just, can Maha do it? [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4774.160000000001s)]
*  What do they need to do better? [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4776.280000000001s)]
*  What can you do? [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4777.96s)]
*  What can we all do? [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4779.96s)]
*  Great question. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4781.200000000001s)]
*  And it was funny to me, [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4782.04s)]
*  I was thinking as you were talking about how, [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4782.860000000001s)]
*  when Michelle Obama started her Let's Move campaign, [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4784.68s)]
*  it was a blue issue. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4787.76s)]
*  A lot of the people who were pushing this agenda [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4789.56s)]
*  was Shelley Pingree, who's a Democrat from Maine, [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4791.64s)]
*  or Tim McGovern, who's from Massachusetts, [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4794.3s)]
*  or Cory Booker, who issues all these bills [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4798.02s)]
*  about food safety, last Congress. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4800.0s)]
*  And all of a sudden, it flipped [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4802.64s)]
*  and became a Republican issue, which is staggering to me. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4804.56s)]
*  And we now see bills in a few dozen states, [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4808.240000000001s)]
*  or more actually, and every day I hear about new bills [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4811.88s)]
*  that are helping push forward an agenda [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4814.24s)]
*  to fix our food system. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4815.92s)]
*  And before you dive in, [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4817.16s)]
*  I just wanna seed this answer with one thing. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4818.12s)]
*  Forgive me, audience, they don't like it when I interrupt. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4820.54s)]
*  But the goal of the left, if I may, [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4822.46s)]
*  seems to be to make anyone associated with health [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4826.96s)]
*  and Maha on the right a jock, not a scientist. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4831.719999999999s)]
*  That's what I'm seeing. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4835.28s)]
*  They're trying to take away their science credential [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4836.12s)]
*  and make them a jock. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4838.8s)]
*  Now, Bobby Kennedy is not a formally trained scientist, [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4839.719999999999s)]
*  but the scientists that are going into NIH directorships, [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4842.88s)]
*  who I can't share who they are, [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4846.32s)]
*  besides Jay, who's been announced, the other ones, [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4847.72s)]
*  but you know who they are, these are serious scientists. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4849.66s)]
*  These aren't jocks. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4852.68s)]
*  These are people that may or may not lift weights. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4854.06s)]
*  But there seems to be this effort to say, [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4857.04s)]
*  we're going to strip Maha of its power [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4858.6s)]
*  by making it a bro-science, biohacking, jock thing. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4862.08s)]
*  Real science is about reductionist stuff. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4866.14s)]
*  And I just say, listen, it's all valuable. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4868.6s)]
*  And so I'm fundamentally frustrated, [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4872.28s)]
*  and it hasn't even begun. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4874.96s)]
*  So educate us. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4876.219999999999s)]
*  I mean, listen, my friend Rick Warren said, [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4877.32s)]
*  I'm not left-wing or right-wing. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4879.32s)]
*  I'm for the whole bird. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4880.719999999999s)]
*  Otherwise, you'll fly around in circles. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4881.5599999999995s)]
*  I like that. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4883.4s)]
*  Who said that? [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4884.24s)]
*  Rick Warren. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4885.08s)]
*  Who's Rick Warren? [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4885.92s)]
*  Rick Warren is the head of Saddleback Church, [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4886.76s)]
*  which is an evangelical church in Southern California. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4888.639999999999s)]
*  We did a whole program with this church [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4891.34s)]
*  where we got 15,000 people to lose [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4892.76s)]
*  a quarter million pounds in a year [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4895.28s)]
*  by doing health together in groups. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4896.4s)]
*  And it was amazing, actually. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4898.679999999999s)]
*  I love that quote. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4900.16s)]
*  It was a great quote. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4901.0s)]
*  And health isn't red or blue or purple. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4902.04s)]
*  It's like a human issue. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4905.400000000001s)]
*  And to make it partisan, it doesn't make any sense to me. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4906.76s)]
*  And yet, we live in a partisan world. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4911.360000000001s)]
*  And anything the Democrats do, [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4913.400000000001s)]
*  the Republicans are gonna hate, [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4914.68s)]
*  anything the Republicans do, [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4915.56s)]
*  the Democrats are gonna hate, [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4916.400000000001s)]
*  it's like, hey guys, can't we just talk to each other [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4917.24s)]
*  and have a civil discourse [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4919.72s)]
*  and agree on the things we can agree on [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4920.96s)]
*  and disagree on the things we're gonna disagree on? [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4922.32s)]
*  And I know behind the scenes, [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4924.4400000000005s)]
*  there's collaboration bipartisan on these issues. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4926.860000000001s)]
*  There's bipartisan caucus that. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4928.96s)]
*  Well, on the psychedelic issue, [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4930.72s)]
*  I was at a meeting where Governor Rick Perry, [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4932.240000000001s)]
*  former Governor Rick Perry, Texas, [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4935.16s)]
*  like who describes himself as a knuckle dragging Republican. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4937.4400000000005s)]
*  Those are Rick's words, by the way. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4941.16s)]
*  Rick's a very nice guy. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4942.240000000001s)]
*  And there were several members of the Dems there. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4943.4400000000005s)]
*  And you got Rick Doblin, who was like a counterculture, [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4947.92s)]
*  conscientious objector during the Vietnam War. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4951.8s)]
*  And they're all up there being proponents for psychedelics [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4954.04s)]
*  for the treatment of PTSD and veterans. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4956.4400000000005s)]
*  So they've joined hands. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4958.280000000001s)]
*  I think that's one area that's very exciting. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4960.24s)]
*  It's not happening in nutrition. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4962.24s)]
*  It's not happening on this thing of get exercise. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4964.36s)]
*  Those have become red labels. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4967.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's unfortunate, [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4968.679999999999s)]
*  because Americans are suffering. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4969.679999999999s)]
*  Americans are really suffering. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4972.639999999999s)]
*  93% of us have some metabolic dysfunction. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4974.5599999999995s)]
*  Psychiatric illness is on the rise in both kids and adults. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4977.8s)]
*  Autoimmune diseases are skyrocketing. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4981.96s)]
*  Obviously, obesity is a huge problem. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4983.639999999999s)]
*  Diabetes is a huge problem. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4985.28s)]
*  Heart disease, deaths are going down, [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4987.5599999999995s)]
*  but the incidence is going up, [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4990.68s)]
*  meaning there's more people getting it, [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4991.52s)]
*  but because we have better treatments, [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4993.04s)]
*  they don't die from it. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4994.12s)]
*  Same thing with cancer. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4995.4800000000005s)]
*  So we're not winning on the health front [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4996.32s)]
*  in the war on chronic disease. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=4998.56s)]
*  We're losing disastrously. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5000.56s)]
*  And so we have to come together as a country to solve this. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5002.2s)]
*  And it's unfortunate mid-polarized. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5005.16s)]
*  I think the good part about COVID [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5007.0s)]
*  was that people became aware [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5010.16s)]
*  that this edifice of science and medicine had cracks in it, [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5012.28s)]
*  and that they needed to be more empowered [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5016.04s)]
*  around their own health and to start questioning things. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5018.04s)]
*  And I think that's part of the genesis [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5021.0s)]
*  of this bigger, wider movement [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5024.44s)]
*  around Make America Healthy Again [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5025.76s)]
*  and why Bobby Kennedy was able to catalyze a huge base. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5027.68s)]
*  He was Democratic candidate at first, [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5031.04s)]
*  then he was independent, [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5033.5199999999995s)]
*  now he's in the Republican administration. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5034.84s)]
*  It doesn't mean he shares all the ideology that they have, [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5037.2s)]
*  but he cares about this issue. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5039.68s)]
*  And so I think what's happening behind the scenes [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5041.64s)]
*  is there's a lot of bipartisan interest [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5044.5199999999995s)]
*  in how do we begin to address this. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5046.4s)]
*  Look, the healthcare bill is $5 trillion. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5048.4s)]
*  Of that, the government, federal government pays 40%. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5052.799999999999s)]
*  It's one in three federal tax dollars. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5057.48s)]
*  So one in three dollars that you pay for your taxes [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5059.24s)]
*  goes to healthcare. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5061.36s)]
*  Of that, 80% is mostly for chronic disease. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5062.599999999999s)]
*  It's either preventable or reversible [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5065.5599999999995s)]
*  through intensive lifestyle therapy. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5067.639999999999s)]
*  And some things are on the margins. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5070.599999999999s)]
*  If insurance is private, how does that work? [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5072.799999999999s)]
*  How is it that my money is going to take care [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5075.68s)]
*  of somebody who has heart disease? [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5078.280000000001s)]
*  For example, if you get onto Medicare Advantage, [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5080.240000000001s)]
*  that's a government program, [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5084.240000000001s)]
*  but it's administered by Humana or by Cigna [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5086.92s)]
*  or by these insurance companies [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5089.8s)]
*  kind of deploy federal resources to deliver healthcare. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5091.6s)]
*  But if you actually look at the end to end, [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5095.240000000001s)]
*  it's Medicare, Medicaid, Indian Health Service, [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5097.12s)]
*  federal employees, Children's Health Program, [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5100.96s)]
*  you just add up all the things [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5103.200000000001s)]
*  that the government pays for, [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5105.2s)]
*  it's almost $2 trillion a year for healthcare. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5106.8s)]
*  Most people don't realize that. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5111.2s)]
*  So the government has enormous leverage. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5112.2s)]
*  And when I was sitting in my office treating my patients [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5113.92s)]
*  who are just endless stream of people [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5117.28s)]
*  with chronic illnesses coming in, [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5119.5199999999995s)]
*  diabetes, obesity, autoimmune disease, [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5120.679999999999s)]
*  this, that, the other thing, [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5122.8s)]
*  I'm like, why is this patient sick? [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5124.28s)]
*  Well, it's mostly because of the food they're eating. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5125.72s)]
*  And if that's the problem, [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5130.0s)]
*  then what's the cause of the food they're eating? [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5131.96s)]
*  Well, it's our food policies. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5134.12s)]
*  What's the cause of our food policies? [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5136.84s)]
*  It's the food industry has pressured our government [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5139.28s)]
*  into creating a food system that's harming us. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5144.04s)]
*  And we have very different policies than they do in Europe. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5146.76s)]
*  For example, they don't allow many GMO foods or glyphosate. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5149.12s)]
*  They don't, they have those- [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5152.6s)]
*  High fructose corn syrup? [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5153.5599999999995s)]
*  They have it there, but it's limited. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5154.88s)]
*  I mean, more limited. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5156.24s)]
*  There's toxins, there's 10,000 additives to food in America. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5157.64s)]
*  There's 400 that are allowed in Europe. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5160.5599999999995s)]
*  Okay, let me ask you a question about toxins [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5162.16s)]
*  because I've been watching this very closely online recently. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5163.76s)]
*  And folks who are more of the traditional science background [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5167.16s)]
*  who are kind of like to spend a lot of their time [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5170.4400000000005s)]
*  trying to debunk folks like you, [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5173.68s)]
*  or people that talk about food additives, [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5175.84s)]
*  say that these are infinitesimally small amounts [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5177.72s)]
*  of these dyes, that the amount required to kill a rat, [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5180.84s)]
*  the like the, you know, is 3000 times higher. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5184.56s)]
*  My stance on this is the same as going through the X, [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5187.76s)]
*  you know, the X-ray machine at the airport, [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5191.28s)]
*  which is true, you can walk through and not get cancer. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5194.44s)]
*  It's dose, frequency, and duration. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5196.96s)]
*  But if you're going through it multiple times [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5198.5599999999995s)]
*  per month or year, then, you know, [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5200.32s)]
*  and it's compounding with other things. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5202.96s)]
*  So it's, like you said, dose, frequency, and duration. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5204.5599999999995s)]
*  And the interactions, like, you know, [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5207.04s)]
*  when these things are studied, [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5209.24s)]
*  they might be studied one at a time. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5210.08s)]
*  But what if you put thousands of them together, [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5212.36s)]
*  whether it's environmental chemicals or food additives, [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5215.04s)]
*  and I don't think the food additives themselves, [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5217.88s)]
*  although there are many that are problematic, [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5219.76s)]
*  that are linked to cancer, linked to allergy, [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5221.84s)]
*  linked to ADD, I think there are a lot of data about this. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5223.96s)]
*  But the real issue is, where do you find these? [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5228.92s)]
*  You find these in extremely low quality, [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5231.08s)]
*  health destroying foods that are ultra processed foods, [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5235.240000000001s)]
*  that are high in starch and sugar, [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5239.52s)]
*  high in refined oils, high in these additives. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5241.320000000001s)]
*  Right, they're not creating orange steaks. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5243.88s)]
*  Yeah, you're not getting these chemicals [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5246.12s)]
*  when you order broccoli at a restaurant, right? [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5248.16s)]
*  So how do you tease out all of it? [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5250.4s)]
*  How do you do human trials on this? [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5252.28s)]
*  It's very hard. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5253.72s)]
*  But in Europe, they have the precautionary principle, [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5254.68s)]
*  was you have to prove it safe [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5256.76s)]
*  before we add it to the food supply. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5258.72s)]
*  Crisco is a great example. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5260.72s)]
*  Crisco was invented in 1911. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5261.92s)]
*  It was shortening, because there was a butter shortage. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5264.4s)]
*  And so they basically created this product, [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5268.12s)]
*  which is blowing hydrogen atoms into liquid vegetable oil [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5271.12s)]
*  that makes it act like an animal fat, like lard or butter. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5276.12s)]
*  And it was cheap and it was good. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5281.8s)]
*  So it was in the supply from 1911 to 2015. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5283.48s)]
*  It wasn't until 50 years after the data [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5286.92s)]
*  had started to become clear [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5289.64s)]
*  that this was a cause of heart attacks, [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5290.48s)]
*  that this was very dangerous, [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5292.2s)]
*  we shouldn't be eating margarine. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5293.5199999999995s)]
*  I remember a tub of that in our cupboard when I was a kid. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5294.72s)]
*  I grew up on fleshless margarine. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5297.04s)]
*  And it wasn't until the scientists [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5299.08s)]
*  who'd been studying for 50 years, [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5301.84s)]
*  it was 90 years all the time, [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5302.96s)]
*  who sued the FDA and forced them [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5304.04s)]
*  to really do something about it, [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5306.36s)]
*  that it got taken off the generally recognized as safe list, [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5307.88s)]
*  which is called the grass list. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5312.12s)]
*  Now, you asked about Maha, [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5313.96s)]
*  well, one of the first things Robert F. Kennedy did, [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5315.04s)]
*  and I helped advise him on this, [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5317.28s)]
*  was to help address the grass problem, [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5318.6s)]
*  because there's something called the grass loophole. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5321.64s)]
*  If you're a food company, [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5324.08s)]
*  you can go to the FDA and say, [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5325.88s)]
*  hey, I got this great new chemical. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5326.96s)]
*  We checked it out, totally safe, not a problem. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5329.2s)]
*  We're gonna add it to the food, [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5332.76s)]
*  just take our word for it. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5334.4800000000005s)]
*  And the FDA goes, great, no problem. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5335.92s)]
*  You go right ahead. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5338.2s)]
*  Imagine if a drug company did that and said, [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5339.96s)]
*  oh, we have this great new drug, [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5342.24s)]
*  we've done all our tests, it's perfectly safe, [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5343.4800000000005s)]
*  it's very effective, can you please give us approval, [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5345.4800000000005s)]
*  and we're not gonna give you any data. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5347.84s)]
*  That's exactly what happens in America. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5350.320000000001s)]
*  Now, that's different than in Europe, [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5352.280000000001s)]
*  which they do the opposite. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5353.72s)]
*  You have to prove that it's safe [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5355.12s)]
*  before it's added to the food supply. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5356.68s)]
*  Here, you're innocent until proven guilty, [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5358.64s)]
*  which is fine for humans, [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5361.16s)]
*  but not for chemicals we put in our food. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5362.2s)]
*  The other day, I saw something on X that, if true, [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5364.84s)]
*  and I'll put a link to it, [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5370.8s)]
*  was probably the most troubling thing I've ever seen [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5372.68s)]
*  in public health discourse. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5375.5599999999995s)]
*  And I want that to lead to a question for you. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5377.44s)]
*  This was an example of a hearing in Washington [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5383.0s)]
*  where a young woman, I believe she's from Austin, [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5386.28s)]
*  who's a kind of like health food advocate, [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5389.44s)]
*  but with training from a university down there, [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5394.4s)]
*  was lobbying against soda [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5398.919999999999s)]
*  in the government-funded lunch program. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5401.4s)]
*  Lunch or food stamp? [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5404.759999999999s)]
*  SNAP program. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5406.96s)]
*  SNAP is the food stamp. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5407.799999999999s)]
*  It's called Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5409.28s)]
*  but there's no N in there. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5412.12s)]
*  Our goal is to put the N back in SNAP. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5413.879999999999s)]
*  Because just to be clear, food security [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5416.48s)]
*  is having enough calories. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5420.04s)]
*  Nutrition security is having enough nutrients. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5420.88s)]
*  We provide it for food security, [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5422.679999999999s)]
*  meaning you can get all your calories from soda [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5425.0s)]
*  and sugar, but that doesn't mean [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5427.599999999999s)]
*  you have nutrition security. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5430.16s)]
*  And we see many of the people [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5431.679999999999s)]
*  who receive these federal aid programs [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5433.4s)]
*  are the ones who are most sick, [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5435.32s)]
*  the most using our healthcare system. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5437.08s)]
*  Thanks for that clarification. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5439.599999999999s)]
*  This young woman advocating for healthier food [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5441.2s)]
*  was arguing for getting a sugary soda. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5444.08s)]
*  This wasn't diet soda. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5448.0s)]
*  This was sugary soda out of the SNAP program. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5449.6s)]
*  And she made her case. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5452.16s)]
*  It was a terrific case, well articulated, I think, [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5453.8s)]
*  and was well received by both the blue side [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5457.16s)]
*  and the red side of the room. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5459.8s)]
*  And then someone tapped into the microphone. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5461.4s)]
*  This was a gentleman representing [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5463.92s)]
*  the American Heart Association. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5465.56s)]
*  The American Heart Association. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5467.32s)]
*  And he proceeded to say [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5469.92s)]
*  that he opposed the removal of sugary soda. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5471.4800000000005s)]
*  Do you know why? [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5474.8s)]
*  I thought, okay, this has got to either be AI-generated, [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5475.64s)]
*  it's fake, but then one of the women on the panel [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5479.56s)]
*  who was listening, okay, one of the people making decisions [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5482.0s)]
*  or at least running it up the flagpole for decisions, [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5484.68s)]
*  said, wait, do you realize what you're saying? [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5487.16s)]
*  And he just kept repeating this like a broken record. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5489.68s)]
*  And I thought, okay, if it was the American Soda Association [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5492.72s)]
*  or Beverage Association or Hydration Association even, [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5496.96s)]
*  I would have thought, okay, maybe there's something here. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5500.08s)]
*  But he was there representing [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5502.4800000000005s)]
*  the American Heart Association. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5503.320000000001s)]
*  I have no skin in this game, okay? [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5504.68s)]
*  I don't drink sugary soda. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5506.6s)]
*  I can answer that question. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5507.44s)]
*  And I was shocked. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5508.36s)]
*  And I will provide a link to this in the show no captions. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5510.719999999999s)]
*  I was shocked. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5513.0s)]
*  He shouldn't be. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5513.96s)]
*  He shouldn't be. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5514.799999999999s)]
*  And I thought to myself, this guy's arguing [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5515.639999999999s)]
*  for sugary soda on behalf of the American Heart Association. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5517.36s)]
*  And these are sugary sodas that the American taxpayer [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5521.24s)]
*  is paying to try and help some of the least healthy [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5523.4s)]
*  and lowest income people in the country drink more soda. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5527.28s)]
*  And it wasn't like take away soda [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5531.44s)]
*  and don't replace it with anything. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5533.799999999999s)]
*  Replace it with some other food. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5535.96s)]
*  There's double bucks for fruits and vegetables. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5537.5199999999995s)]
*  Or even water, right? [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5538.76s)]
*  So I was shocked. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5540.12s)]
*  I verified it's real. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5544.8s)]
*  And okay, so I'd like your thoughts on that, [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5546.92s)]
*  but I'm guessing what they are already. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5549.88s)]
*  But here's what I wanna know. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5552.28s)]
*  Is the FDA and our government so strongly impacted [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5554.12s)]
*  by these food companies? [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5558.96s)]
*  You hear this, but it always sounds [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5560.6s)]
*  like a bunch of conspiracy stuff. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5561.88s)]
*  Let me think about it back, Loach. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5562.72s)]
*  Is General Mills really lobbying behind scenes? [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5563.92s)]
*  Is there really a network of people trying to harm us [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5569.280000000001s)]
*  for profit? 100%, yes. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5572.6s)]
*  So I was telling the server how I was in my office [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5574.8s)]
*  seeing patients with diabetes. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5576.080000000001s)]
*  I'm like, what caused the food policy? [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5577.6s)]
*  And then I started to go down that rabbit hole. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5578.76s)]
*  And I wrote a book called Food Fix, [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5581.4400000000005s)]
*  How to Save Our Health, Our Economy, Our Communities, [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5582.84s)]
*  and Our Planet One Bite at a Time, [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5586.200000000001s)]
*  where I mapped out from field to fork [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5587.68s)]
*  the problems with our food industry, [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5589.6s)]
*  how it's making us sick, [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5590.72s)]
*  how it's costing us trillions of dollars, [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5591.88s)]
*  and how to fix it. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5594.24s)]
*  And then I started a nonprofit where I'd been in Washington [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5595.08s)]
*  doing this work the last five years, [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5596.719999999999s)]
*  way before it was, MAHA was a thing. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5598.08s)]
*  And what you just described is part of a large, [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5600.5599999999995s)]
*  cohesive strategy by the food industry [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5605.36s)]
*  to undermine science, manipulate public trust [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5608.44s)]
*  and information, to control the government [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5613.16s)]
*  and academic institutions and many things. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5615.639999999999s)]
*  So I'll just kinda lay it out for you. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5617.839999999999s)]
*  Sounds conspiracy. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5618.92s)]
*  It sounds like it is, and it kinda, [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5620.04s)]
*  I wouldn't say it's a conspiracy, [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5622.8s)]
*  it's just their business strategy, right? [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5624.0s)]
*  Which is to circle the wagons. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5626.0s)]
*  They fund the American Heart Association. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5627.96s)]
*  So the food and farm industry spent $192 million [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5631.08s)]
*  that they give to the American Heart Association. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5635.72s)]
*  What does the American Heart Association do with it? [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5637.68s)]
*  They educate people about nutrition, [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5639.320000000001s)]
*  they hold meetings, they have scientific panels. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5641.52s)]
*  But what is the basis for sugary soda? [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5644.2s)]
*  Like there can't, there's no single argument [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5645.92s)]
*  for sugary soda. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5648.24s)]
*  If you get $20 million from the soda industry, [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5649.16s)]
*  I mean, it's like that, Andrew. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5651.84s)]
*  I'm not. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5654.2s)]
*  But maybe diet soda, we could argue artificial sweeteners, [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5655.04s)]
*  but at least we know it can help people lose weight, [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5657.8s)]
*  they're adjusting less sugar. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5659.88s)]
*  No, this is like 40% of the Academy of Nutrition [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5661.360000000001s)]
*  and Dietetics, which is the National Nutrition Organization, [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5664.88s)]
*  comes from the food industry. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5668.04s)]
*  The American Diabetes Association, [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5670.04s)]
*  the American Academy of Pediatrics, [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5671.8s)]
*  the American Family Practice. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5673.84s)]
*  This has to change. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5675.16s)]
*  I mean, Coca-Cola gave a multi-million dollar donation [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5676.0s)]
*  to the American Academy of Family Practice, [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5679.92s)]
*  and they were family doctors that quit in droves [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5682.200000000001s)]
*  because of this. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5683.84s)]
*  When did this start? [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5684.68s)]
*  I think it's been growing. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5685.52s)]
*  So there's multiple strategies they have. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5686.72s)]
*  One is massive lobbying, [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5688.4800000000005s)]
*  two is funding professional associations. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5690.240000000001s)]
*  But was this in the 80s, the 90s? [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5692.080000000001s)]
*  I think it's been slow creep since probably the 70s, [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5693.8s)]
*  is my guess. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5696.84s)]
*  If you look in the 60s and the beach pictures, [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5697.76s)]
*  like there's nobody overweight, right? [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5699.72s)]
*  When I was growing up, [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5701.4800000000005s)]
*  there were probably two fat kids in school. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5702.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5703.56s)]
*  They've done all these strategic things around lobbying, [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5704.400000000001s)]
*  around funding professional associations, [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5706.56s)]
*  funding academic research, [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5708.52s)]
*  12 times as much academic research on nutrition [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5710.32s)]
*  as the federal government spends. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5712.84s)]
*  They co-op social groups like NAACP and the Hispanic [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5714.5199999999995s)]
*  Federation so they won't oppose things that they care about [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5718.36s)]
*  or they'll oppose things they care about like soda taxes. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5722.0s)]
*  And they fund fake science groups, [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5724.36s)]
*  like the American Council on Science and Health. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5726.759999999999s)]
*  It's attacked me, maybe attacked you too. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5728.5199999999995s)]
*  Not yet. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5730.4s)]
*  I'm sure they will after this episode. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5731.24s)]
*  They like unbiased science and all these great sounding [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5732.08s)]
*  organizations that are simply front groups [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5735.12s)]
*  for misinformation, CropLife. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5737.28s)]
*  And so they have a whole strategic approach [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5741.08s)]
*  that is very detailed. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5742.28s)]
*  And I map the whole thing out in my book [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5744.04s)]
*  and how it's so insidious and how it happened [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5746.48s)]
*  while everybody else was asleep. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5749.08s)]
*  And I know personally now that some of these big associations [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5750.12s)]
*  that are the lobby groups for these big food companies [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5754.84s)]
*  and ag companies, these heat companies, [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5758.36s)]
*  that they're circling ranks, [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5759.96s)]
*  that they're creating a war plan, [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5761.5599999999995s)]
*  that they have a complete strategy of how to put forth [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5763.08s)]
*  this kind of, I would say, manipulative science. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5766.96s)]
*  They have grassroots lobby efforts [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5770.280000000001s)]
*  where they're activating fake grassroots movements. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5772.0s)]
*  They're lobbying, they're looking at how to pressure [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5774.92s)]
*  state governments to not do what they're doing. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5777.88s)]
*  I mean, I know personally the governor of West Virginia [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5779.8s)]
*  who has now, there's a state bill to actually, [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5782.88s)]
*  which probably hopefully passed by the time [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5786.240000000001s)]
*  this podcast comes out, that gets rid of chemicals [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5787.68s)]
*  in the food in West Virginia, [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5790.68s)]
*  which is the fattest state in the nation. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5792.0s)]
*  And I know the amount of pressure, [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5794.0s)]
*  millions and millions of dollars of pressure [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5795.76s)]
*  they're putting on him to not do it. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5797.52s)]
*  It's gonna destroy their businesses, [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5798.68s)]
*  it's gonna destroy the economy, [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5799.8s)]
*  that's gonna create the people of West Virginia suffering. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5801.400000000001s)]
*  I mean, so much pressure on politicians [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5803.8s)]
*  who don't actually understand these issues. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5807.16s)]
*  And so they're like, and I remember- [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5809.360000000001s)]
*  Well, it's confusing even as somebody [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5811.16s)]
*  who is fairly versed in health and nutrition. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5812.6s)]
*  Like I'm- [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5815.4800000000005s)]
*  I'll give you an example. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5816.4400000000005s)]
*  I mean, it's- [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5817.280000000001s)]
*  It's not confusing, I'll give you an example. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5818.12s)]
*  So I was working on a bill that was with Andy Harris, [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5818.96s)]
*  who was a doctor in Congress, [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5822.64s)]
*  to do a pilot study to see the impact, [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5825.280000000001s)]
*  not to change policy, just to study the impact [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5828.68s)]
*  of what would happen if you took soda [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5830.68s)]
*  off the list of acceptable things you could buy [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5832.4400000000005s)]
*  with food stamp dollars. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5834.4800000000005s)]
*  Just to do a pilot in a couple of states. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5836.4400000000005s)]
*  You think, well, let's just do a scientific study [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5838.96s)]
*  and see what happens. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5840.8s)]
*  The Democrats were completely opposed to it. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5842.52s)]
*  They shut the whole thing down. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5845.4800000000005s)]
*  On what grounds? [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5847.200000000001s)]
*  The hunger groups. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5848.4800000000005s)]
*  It's based on this idea of like, [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5850.120000000001s)]
*  we're gonna take care of the poor, [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5851.160000000001s)]
*  it's discriminatory, it's regressive, [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5853.12s)]
*  it's gonna hurt the poor. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5854.12s)]
*  And the hunger groups that are these big groups [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5855.48s)]
*  that try to deal with hunger in America, [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5858.679999999999s)]
*  are funded by, and their boards of directors [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5861.5599999999995s)]
*  are staffed by people from Big Food. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5864.5199999999995s)]
*  So if you just follow the money, [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5868.48s)]
*  you see how it all is connected [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5870.4s)]
*  and how it all flows together. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5871.839999999999s)]
*  And what are Big Food? [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5872.92s)]
*  So like, what are the companies? [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5873.88s)]
*  Okay, so there are companies you know about. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5875.2s)]
*  There's even things like Primal Kitchen, [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5876.96s)]
*  which you think is like a great natural brand [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5879.5199999999995s)]
*  and started by Mark Sisson in its salad dressings [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5882.0s)]
*  and ketchup without high fructose corn syrup. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5883.96s)]
*  And it's a great product. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5885.400000000001s)]
*  They're all bought up by the big food companies [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5887.2s)]
*  like Mondalase or by Kraft Heinz for example, [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5888.72s)]
*  bought that or Hugh Chocolate, [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5892.400000000001s)]
*  which thank God will stay the same forever [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5894.24s)]
*  because Jason Carp was a friend, made sure they would. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5896.16s)]
*  But they bought Hugh Chocolate, [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5898.4800000000005s)]
*  which we think is a natural brand. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5899.96s)]
*  It's the biggest selling premium chocolate in America. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5901.2s)]
*  So they buy all the other companies. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5903.360000000001s)]
*  So it's Nestle, it's Gene Leaver, it's The Known, [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5904.52s)]
*  it's Mondalase, it's Kraft Heinz. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5906.56s)]
*  So it's a few companies that really probably [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5908.6s)]
*  are the 10 or so companies that basically [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5911.16s)]
*  are the big companies. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5913.5199999999995s)]
*  And then there's all the Ag and Seed and Chem companies. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5914.36s)]
*  It's all consolidation. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5916.8s)]
*  So there used to be like hundreds of seed companies. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5917.92s)]
*  Now there's five. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5920.44s)]
*  There used to be like dozens of fertilizers companies. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5921.36s)]
*  Now there's just a few. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5923.48s)]
*  If I take a step back from this, I say, [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5924.5599999999995s)]
*  okay, well Mark, I haven't tried Primal Kitchen, [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5926.44s)]
*  but I hear good things, right? [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5928.84s)]
*  Mark seems like a very health conscious guy. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5930.2s)]
*  So Mark Sisson, right? [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5932.92s)]
*  So if his brand was bought up [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5934.4s)]
*  by one of these major companies, [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5936.08s)]
*  why aren't they promoting the healthier foods [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5937.5199999999995s)]
*  in their catalog? [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5939.2s)]
*  Well they do, they do. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5940.36s)]
*  But also without, if there's like Jason Carpfer [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5941.5599999999995s)]
*  with Hugh Chocolate made them in the contract [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5944.599999999999s)]
*  promised they would never change the ingredients ever. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5947.2s)]
*  I see. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5949.5199999999995s)]
*  And when you often get these other products [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5950.36s)]
*  that have been bought up by these big companies, [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5953.2s)]
*  they modify the recipes, they make it cheaper, [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5955.4s)]
*  they squeeze their margins to be bigger. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5958.08s)]
*  So it's not like you're gonna get like Amy's whatever pizza [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5961.2s)]
*  or whatever sounds like great healthy pizza, [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5965.759999999999s)]
*  but they modify it. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5967.96s)]
*  And so I think as a whole they still get most [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5969.92s)]
*  of their profit margin from their legacy products of junk. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5973.96s)]
*  So they don't wanna cannibalize that, [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5977.6s)]
*  but they also wanna suck up the rest of the market [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5979.56s)]
*  so they have a monopoly. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5981.200000000001s)]
*  But there's probably a few dozen CEOs [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5983.88s)]
*  that are in control of everything [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5985.56s)]
*  from what seeds are planted to what chemicals are sprayed [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5988.400000000001s)]
*  to the food companies that process the food [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5992.360000000001s)]
*  to the fast food companies. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5996.6s)]
*  It's not that many companies [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5997.64s)]
*  and it's a few dozen CEOs that control the biggest industry [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=5998.92s)]
*  in the planet that employs more than everybody else [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6001.76s)]
*  because everybody eats. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6003.4400000000005s)]
*  It's like $16 trillion. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6004.28s)]
*  So are you and Bobby going to change the way that works? [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6006.0s)]
*  I mean, that's the goal. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6011.400000000001s)]
*  I mean, the idea is to raise awareness, [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6012.24s)]
*  to create transparency, to help people understand [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6014.36s)]
*  what's what and to take the veil back and say, [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6016.400000000001s)]
*  you can choose whatever you wanna eat. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6019.84s)]
*  We're not taking away your McDonald's, [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6021.08s)]
*  we're not taking away your soda, [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6022.32s)]
*  but like at least you should know what's going on. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6024.04s)]
*  If you go to South America, you're from Argentina, [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6026.04s)]
*  I'm sure you've been there not too recent past. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6027.76s)]
*  If you pick up something that's not good for you, [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6030.88s)]
*  it tells you on the label, it's like black warning signs [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6033.4400000000005s)]
*  and hazard signs and stop signs. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6036.24s)]
*  Well, they're the opposite problem exists. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6039.52s)]
*  As the child of a first generation immigrant, [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6042.04s)]
*  my dad always said, the United States is the one country [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6043.96s)]
*  where the poor are overweight because calories are cheap. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6047.16s)]
*  You go to Argentina and you see these neighborhoods [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6049.72s)]
*  are immense poverty, right? [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6052.320000000001s)]
*  And people are not overweight. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6055.16s)]
*  People are struggling to find food. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6056.76s)]
*  Some are, some are. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6058.4400000000005s)]
*  Like if you look at, there was a whole series [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6059.6s)]
*  in the New York Times a few years ago about how, [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6060.88s)]
*  for example, Nestle went into the ghettos of, [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6062.4400000000005s)]
*  I think, Peru and Colombia and they were just Brazil [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6066.24s)]
*  and they were just pushing through local community members [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6069.6s)]
*  and reps would drive around with little carts [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6073.04s)]
*  or push the carts around where there's not even a street [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6075.16s)]
*  to sell all this crappy processed food [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6077.320000000001s)]
*  to people for pennies, right? [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6079.52s)]
*  And so that's what they've done. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6081.4800000000005s)]
*  They've infiltrated everywhere in the planet. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6083.0s)]
*  As far back as 1986, and I did a public health expedition [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6084.84s)]
*  with Johns Hopkins to Nepal, we got off the plane [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6089.52s)]
*  at some remote airport on a grass strip [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6092.56s)]
*  and then we walked for a week up into the, almost to Tibet. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6094.96s)]
*  And there were no roads, there were no cars, [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6099.64s)]
*  there was no electricity, there was no running water, [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6103.400000000001s)]
*  but there was Coca-Cola. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6106.6s)]
*  And you see these sherpas literally with like probably, [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6108.4400000000005s)]
*  I don't know, 100, 200 pounds of Coca-Cola on their back [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6111.56s)]
*  climbing up the mountains, [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6114.16s)]
*  bringing it to every little village, right? [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6115.2s)]
*  I mean, there's even a TED talk on this, [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6118.08s)]
*  but I think I was somewhere, Melinda Gates or something [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6119.76s)]
*  about how Coca-Cola is a business model [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6121.8s)]
*  for how we get safe stuff around the world [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6123.4s)]
*  because they had the incredible distribution. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6126.0s)]
*  So even where you can't get water, you can get Coca-Cola. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6128.24s)]
*  Where they actually need quality. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6132.4s)]
*  Protein is what scares. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6134.76s)]
*  It's often cheaper than water in many countries, [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6136.04s)]
*  like in Mexico. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6138.08s)]
*  So I think we have to face the fact [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6138.92s)]
*  that we've had this sort of unadulterated, [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6141.5199999999995s)]
*  uninhibited run from the industry, [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6145.12s)]
*  and now there's somebody talking about [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6147.12s)]
*  why they need to think about doing things differently. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6148.88s)]
*  How they need to reformulate, how they need to be partners. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6151.48s)]
*  I mean, there was a big meeting [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6154.32s)]
*  with the Consumer Brand Association, [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6155.36s)]
*  Robert F. Kennedy last Monday in the White House, [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6156.8s)]
*  where he said to them essentially, [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6160.08s)]
*  here's what you need to do, do it, [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6162.0s)]
*  or we're gonna make you do it. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6163.96s)]
*  Get the crap out of the food, [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6165.64s)]
*  and let's get focused on the harm that this is causing [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6166.8s)]
*  in terms of the amount of starch and sugar and processing [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6170.36s)]
*  products in there that are not good for human health. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6173.44s)]
*  And if you don't, we're gonna do something about it. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6176.08s)]
*  They can create better front of package labeling [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6178.92s)]
*  to transform people's perception of what's good or not. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6181.08s)]
*  And labels are super confusing in this country. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6184.08s)]
*  I mean, I know how to read them, [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6186.8s)]
*  but you have to be a PhD or study this your whole life [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6187.68s)]
*  to understand how to read the nutrition facts label, [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6189.44s)]
*  how to read an ingredient list, what it means, [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6191.28s)]
*  what the serving size is, what the calories are, [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6193.32s)]
*  what the this and that is. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6195.04s)]
*  It's like, you know, it's not easy for the average American. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6196.2s)]
*  It should be easy. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6198.4800000000005s)]
*  Like you should be- [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6199.32s)]
*  It's intentionally confusing. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6200.14s)]
*  100%. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6201.04s)]
*  Well, a single ingredient or minimal ingredient foods [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6202.08s)]
*  solve that. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6204.32s)]
*  I'd like to take us from one controversial topic. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6205.2s)]
*  And thank you, by the way, I should say, [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6207.5599999999995s)]
*  before moving on from that, [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6209.36s)]
*  for being involved and staying involved. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6211.16s)]
*  I know your inherent goodness and your desire [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6212.76s)]
*  to keep things nonpartisan and to do what's best for people [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6216.44s)]
*  and to keep it out of the politics as much as possible. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6220.5599999999995s)]
*  I mean, these are the things [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6223.44s)]
*  that I've been working on for years. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6224.28s)]
*  And so I'm just- [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6225.72s)]
*  You're just being you. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6226.76s)]
*  I'm just being me, whether it's medically-calor meals [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6227.88s)]
*  or raising the awareness around chronic disease [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6229.88s)]
*  or the effect of toxins in our environment [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6232.16s)]
*  or the role of sugar and starch in our metabolic crisis. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6233.56s)]
*  I mean, these are things that are not new. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6236.320000000001s)]
*  I've talked about these for decades. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6237.56s)]
*  Now all of a sudden it's a political issue. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6238.92s)]
*  I don't understand why. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6240.04s)]
*  You're not putting on a new hat. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6240.88s)]
*  You're not putting on a new hat. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6242.56s)]
*  Government's putting on a new hat, [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6243.700000000001s)]
*  getting involved in these things. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6244.76s)]
*  I'm hopeful. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6245.88s)]
*  They've always been involved, [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6247.4400000000005s)]
*  but they just have been involved unknowingly [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6248.280000000001s)]
*  by allowing policies to be implemented [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6250.4400000000005s)]
*  that support things like soda and junk food. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6253.04s)]
*  If you look at other countries' food assistance programs, [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6255.400000000001s)]
*  you can't buy that shit. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6258.04s)]
*  Right, right. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6260.16s)]
*  Let's talk about something almost as controversial, [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6262.64s)]
*  something that I have kind of a neutral opinion on [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6264.400000000001s)]
*  that I think is a beautiful scientific story, [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6268.52s)]
*  which is GLP-1, agonists, [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6270.88s)]
*  discovered on the basis of the Gila monster, [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6274.6s)]
*  which doesn't need to eat very much, [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6277.72s)]
*  over synthesizes a lot of this peptide, [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6279.4400000000005s)]
*  which limits its hunger, [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6282.88s)]
*  and it works at the level of the brain [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6284.04s)]
*  and at the level of the gut. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6286.400000000001s)]
*  There are, however, lots and lots of cells, [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6288.84s)]
*  including neurons, outside the appetite system [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6292.64s)]
*  that use and bind GLP-1. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6296.28s)]
*  The drugs that increase GLP-1, we had a guest on here, [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6299.56s)]
*  so Zachary Knight came out on here [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6302.6s)]
*  and beautifully explained how the drugs [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6304.4800000000005s)]
*  that increase GLP-1 increase it many thousandfold [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6306.32s)]
*  above natural levels to have it exert its effect [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6310.6s)]
*  of reducing hunger. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6313.96s)]
*  It is reducing obesity. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6316.4800000000005s)]
*  Yes, people lose muscle. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6318.52s)]
*  They break it down for us. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6319.360000000001s)]
*  Let's assume that somebody [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6321.72s)]
*  has just had a terrible time losing weight. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6323.16s)]
*  They don't even feel like they can exercise [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6325.84s)]
*  for either motivational reasons or they're structurally, [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6327.88s)]
*  we all know they should exercise, [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6330.84s)]
*  and maybe they'll get there, one would hope. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6332.240000000001s)]
*  But you can't exercise your way out of a bad diet. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6334.320000000001s)]
*  Right, right. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6336.8s)]
*  Do you think there are use cases for GLP-1 [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6338.400000000001s)]
*  that warrant its prescription? [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6341.4400000000005s)]
*  And what's the controversy with GLP-1 all about? [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6343.08s)]
*  Is it the dependents, the insurance? [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6345.4s)]
*  I mean, we don't have three hours to parse this, but. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6348.16s)]
*  I can give you the quick down and dirty on it. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6350.44s)]
*  What's your view on GLP-1? [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6352.28s)]
*  Because I think some people have clearly benefited from it. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6353.28s)]
*  Other people probably don't need it at all. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6355.759999999999s)]
*  I don't take it. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6357.5599999999995s)]
*  I wouldn't take it, but I'm pretty good at regulating [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6358.48s)]
*  what I put in my mouth. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6361.5199999999995s)]
*  Look, I mean, I think, like you said, [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6363.16s)]
*  this is a molecule that the body naturally makes [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6364.599999999999s)]
*  to regulate appetite, but is being giving it doses [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6366.759999999999s)]
*  that are far greater than that, [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6369.4s)]
*  which our body naturally makes. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6371.5599999999995s)]
*  And when you overdo something, [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6373.76s)]
*  there are downstream consequences. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6376.160000000001s)]
*  Insulin is a peptide. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6377.64s)]
*  Ozempic is a peptide. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6380.200000000001s)]
*  GLP-1, these drugs are peptides. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6381.72s)]
*  These are small mini-proteins. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6383.120000000001s)]
*  Think of that as what a peptide is. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6384.400000000001s)]
*  And insulin, if you take too much of it, will kill you. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6386.8s)]
*  Like literally, you'll go into hypoglycemic shock. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6391.0s)]
*  So when you start messing with big doses, [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6393.280000000001s)]
*  it has not side effects. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6396.08s)]
*  We call these side effects. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6398.56s)]
*  These are just effects we don't like, [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6399.64s)]
*  and we call them side effects. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6401.160000000001s)]
*  They're effects of the drug, [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6402.28s)]
*  and they can lead to everything from things you mentioned, [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6404.12s)]
*  like muscle wasting, which is a big problem [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6406.2s)]
*  because you lose the weight and you lose muscle and fat, [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6408.92s)]
*  and if you lose half of it is muscle, [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6411.32s)]
*  then your metabolism slows down [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6413.92s)]
*  because muscle burns seven times as much calories as fat. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6415.759999999999s)]
*  And when you gain the weight back, if you stop, [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6418.8s)]
*  which over 65% of people do. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6420.5599999999995s)]
*  Is that right? [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6423.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6424.44s)]
*  People who come off it gain the weight back. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6425.259999999999s)]
*  100%. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6426.099999999999s)]
*  They just start eating more again. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6426.94s)]
*  And they have lower muscle mass. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6427.759999999999s)]
*  And then you're in a worse situation [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6428.8s)]
*  because you have a lower muscle mass, [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6430.2s)]
*  so you could eat literally the same amount of calories [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6431.4s)]
*  as you were before you lost weight [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6433.599999999999s)]
*  and gain weight because your metabolism is messed up. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6434.719999999999s)]
*  What if they exercise using resistance training [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6436.96s)]
*  to offset that? [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6439.44s)]
*  I personally think it should be illegal [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6440.28s)]
*  to prescribe these drugs unless they're combined [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6442.639999999999s)]
*  with a nutrition consult to educate people [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6445.5199999999995s)]
*  about their protein requirements that are increased [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6448.44s)]
*  and with an exercise or a trainer, [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6450.599999999999s)]
*  a physiology or a trainer, [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6452.36s)]
*  to help them develop a strength training program. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6453.759999999999s)]
*  And then I'd be more okay with it. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6455.92s)]
*  And I think doses also, do we need the doses [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6458.04s)]
*  that people are prescribed [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6460.44s)]
*  through pharmacologically approved drugs [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6461.599999999999s)]
*  or there's a whole black market of GLP-1 peptides [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6464.24s)]
*  you can buy for 20 bucks a month, [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6467.719999999999s)]
*  not 16 or 17, 100 bucks a month. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6469.12s)]
*  People are starting to discover those. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6471.5199999999995s)]
*  They're very inexpensive. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6473.04s)]
*  They're very inexpensive. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6474.16s)]
*  And you have to know what you're doing [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6475.08s)]
*  and you have to probably get the guidance of a physician. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6476.5599999999995s)]
*  And there are doctors who do prescribe [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6478.379999999999s)]
*  these sort of subpharmacologic doses that are being given. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6480.639999999999s)]
*  And they work and they can be a useful tool, [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6483.639999999999s)]
*  but they're a tool like anything else. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6486.5599999999995s)]
*  And I was mentioning my nonprofit Food Fix. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6488.48s)]
*  The woman who's working with us there [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6490.879999999999s)]
*  lost 112 pounds in the last few years working with me [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6492.58s)]
*  without GLP-1s. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6495.04s)]
*  I've had literally probably dozens and dozens [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6497.36s)]
*  and dozens of patients who've lost 100 pounds or more [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6500.839999999999s)]
*  without these drugs and naturally keep their weight off [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6503.379999999999s)]
*  and regulate their appetite when they understand [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6505.759999999999s)]
*  how to use food as medicine to regulate their hormones, [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6508.24s)]
*  their peptides, their brain chemistry, their microbiome, [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6512.24s)]
*  all of which regulate our appetite and weight. [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6515.44s)]
*  So there's ways to do it. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6517.8s)]
*  It's harder and some people are stuck [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6519.52s)]
*  and I'm not opposed to using these drugs, [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6521.0s)]
*  but we have to understand they come with risks [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6522.8s)]
*  and they have increased risk of bowel obstruction, [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6524.52s)]
*  increased risk of pancreatitis, [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6527.6s)]
*  increased risk of potentially thyroid issues, [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6528.9400000000005s)]
*  of kidney issues. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6531.04s)]
*  And I think people need to, [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6531.88s)]
*  if they're monitoring their cells, fine. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6532.96s)]
*  You should get a DEXA scan before and during and after. [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6535.64s)]
*  You should be checking your kidney function tests [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6538.64s)]
*  and your amylase and your lipase [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6541.04s)]
*  because it can cause pancreatitis. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6542.56s)]
*  You'd be checking what happens to your other hormones [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6543.68s)]
*  and what happens to your liver function tests [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6546.36s)]
*  which can be affected by these drugs. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6548.12s)]
*  And the longer you take them, the more the side effects are. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6549.44s)]
*  So for example, initially we're seeing very little data [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6551.679999999999s)]
*  and then the data started coming in. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6554.32s)]
*  And for example, if you're on it for four years, [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6555.719999999999s)]
*  your risk of bowel obstruction goes up by four and a half fold. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6557.639999999999s)]
*  That's by 450% or your risk of pancreatitis [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6560.04s)]
*  goes up by 900%. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6563.66s)]
*  That's, you know, it seems like a lot. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6565.92s)]
*  It is a lot, but pancreatitis is a more rare condition. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6567.719999999999s)]
*  But it does have an adverse impact. [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6570.32s)]
*  And a lot of people have nausea, vomiting, [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6572.5s)]
*  all kinds of other side effects [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6574.32s)]
*  that are sort of more mild and not as serious, [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6575.56s)]
*  but they come with side effects. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6578.6s)]
*  So I think, can they be used as part of an overall strategy [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6580.76s)]
*  with nutrition counseling, exercise counseling, [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6583.92s)]
*  and integrating lower doses [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6586.68s)]
*  and modifying the dosing regimen? [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6589.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but I don't think most people need it [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6591.88s)]
*  if they understand how to change their hormones [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6594.400000000001s)]
*  and their brain chemistry and their biology without that. [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6596.6s)]
*  And that's the power of food as medicine. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6598.88s)]
*  And when I say food as medicine, [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6600.4800000000005s)]
*  I'm not saying that as sort of a general, [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6602.04s)]
*  you know, food can be healthy or not healthy. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6603.96s)]
*  I'm saying food literally can be used as a drug [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6605.6s)]
*  and different foods have different properties. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6608.4800000000005s)]
*  And again, you don't use the same drug for every disease. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6610.84s)]
*  You would prescribe different diets for different problems. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6613.96s)]
*  Such as? [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6616.56s)]
*  For example, if you look at the crisis [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6617.4s)]
*  in mental health in this country, [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6619.56s)]
*  we have a severe mental health crisis. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6620.56s)]
*  And we've used ketogenic diets in neurologic conditions [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6622.4800000000005s)]
*  like epilepsy and medicine for decades. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6626.54s)]
*  We now know, for example, [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6629.24s)]
*  ketogenic diets can be very effective for schizophrenia, [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6630.5199999999995s)]
*  for things like autism, for Alzheimer's, [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6634.04s)]
*  for people with bipolar disease or depression or anxiety. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6636.28s)]
*  And this has to do with its effect of the metabolism [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6640.44s)]
*  and the way it affects our brain, our mitochondria. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6644.4s)]
*  And I wrote a book about this ultramind solution. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6647.599999999999s)]
*  I say this, I wrote a book about everything. [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6650.44s)]
*  I pretty much have. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6651.759999999999s)]
*  You've written a lot of books. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6652.599999999999s)]
*  I've written like 20 books. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6653.44s)]
*  It's like, I'm impressed. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6654.8s)]
*  You're working on one, I know. [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6656.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6658.44s)]
*  I mean, it's big enough to serve as a workout for lifting. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6660.280000000001s)]
*  No, it's not that thick. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6664.76s)]
*  It doubles as a advice book and a training. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6666.0s)]
*  It's got a lot in there. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6668.64s)]
*  But you have an impressive catalog of really terrific books. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6671.040000000001s)]
*  But Mayo Clinic just got funded over $3 million [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6675.320000000001s)]
*  to do research on the role of ketogenic diets [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6678.280000000001s)]
*  in serious mental illness. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6681.72s)]
*  You mentioned Stanford has a department [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6682.68s)]
*  of metabolic psychiatry. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6684.68s)]
*  At Harvard, they have a similar department [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6686.240000000001s)]
*  of nutritional psychiatry. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6687.56s)]
*  What about other diets? [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6688.68s)]
*  So ketogenic, a lot of people think of that as high protein. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6689.64s)]
*  It's really more high fat, moderate protein, [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6693.56s)]
*  very low starch, right? [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6695.84s)]
*  What about for cancer and cancer avoidance? [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6698.4400000000005s)]
*  Again, when you look at the data, [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6701.92s)]
*  cancer rates are going up [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6704.04s)]
*  and it's because our metabolic crisis is going up. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6705.04s)]
*  And many cancers are obesity-related. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6707.240000000001s)]
*  Colon cancer, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6709.4800000000005s)]
*  many, many prostate cancer. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6712.4800000000005s)]
*  And they're driven by insulin resistance. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6714.240000000001s)]
*  And we know the cancer has a metabolic capacity [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6715.84s)]
*  to only burn carbs, it can't burn fat. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6718.76s)]
*  So if you stop carbs and you eat fat, [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6720.72s)]
*  you can often change the trajectory of cancer. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6723.24s)]
*  Is that true for all cancers? [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6726.24s)]
*  Are there any cancers that react negatively? [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6727.52s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think that's true for all cancer. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6729.4800000000005s)]
*  For certain lymphomas, I probably don't think it is. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6731.400000000001s)]
*  But Siddhartha Mukherjee, [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6733.4800000000005s)]
*  I don't know if you've had him on the podcast, [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6734.92s)]
*  but he's an incredible giant in the field of medicine [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6736.12s)]
*  and a brilliant scientist at Columbia [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6738.68s)]
*  who's actually an oncologist [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6740.6s)]
*  who wrote a book called The Emperor of All Maladies. [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6742.400000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah, he wrote that book? [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6744.360000000001s)]
*  He wrote The Cell, he wrote The Gene. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6746.4800000000005s)]
*  That was a book about cancer. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6747.92s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, he wrote a book called The Gene, The Cell. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6749.12s)]
*  And he talks about his research on ketogenic diets [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6751.4400000000005s)]
*  for reversing stage four melanoma, [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6754.8s)]
*  stage four pancreatic cancer, very impressive stuff. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6756.4400000000005s)]
*  You probably couldn't like it, could you? [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6759.280000000001s)]
*  Well, I remember The Emperor of All Maladies. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6760.6s)]
*  I read that and I read The Eight Day Creation [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6762.4400000000005s)]
*  in the same, roughly the same time period, [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6765.96s)]
*  both super impressive books. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6767.72s)]
*  I didn't realize he was involved in a ketogenic diet. [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6768.92s)]
*  Yeah, but there's a whole metabolic theory of cancer. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6771.12s)]
*  So I think that's key. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6772.88s)]
*  And certain cancers like brain cancer [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6774.92s)]
*  responds incredibly well. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6777.4400000000005s)]
*  If you have a glioblastoma, [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6778.64s)]
*  which there's really no treatment for, [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6779.68s)]
*  it can be very effective. [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6781.32s)]
*  Yeah, I'll tell you, having lost some friends to cancer, [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6783.16s)]
*  pancreatic cancer and glioblastoma are the two, [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6785.84s)]
*  I mean, I don't want any cancer, [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6789.12s)]
*  but those are the two I really don't want to get. [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6790.24s)]
*  These are all super important topics. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6792.52s)]
*  It seems to come back over and over again [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6794.12s)]
*  to these pillars of health. [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6796.08s)]
*  Food, circadian rhythm, meaning sleep-wake cycles. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6797.08s)]
*  Obviously, the last 50 years in this country [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6800.04s)]
*  were characterized by like smoke less [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6802.6s)]
*  or don't smoke. [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6804.52s)]
*  We now know alcohol is problematic for cancers [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6805.72s)]
*  and other things. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6809.4400000000005s)]
*  Not to say that one can't enjoy a drink [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6810.280000000001s)]
*  every once in a while, but I don't personally drink, [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6813.240000000001s)]
*  but I don't have a propensity for alcohol either. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6816.8s)]
*  So it's easy for me to say. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6819.200000000001s)]
*  I've had to become a little bit softer [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6820.400000000001s)]
*  on my stance on this because I think, [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6822.240000000001s)]
*  like if you told me that caffeine was bad, [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6824.360000000001s)]
*  I'd tell you I'm drinking it. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6827.0s)]
*  I'd say, how long do I have? [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6827.96s)]
*  Yeah, it's like Warren Buffett. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6829.200000000001s)]
*  He says, I don't care if I eat this shit. [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6830.96s)]
*  If it makes me live a couple of years less, [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6832.040000000001s)]
*  I'm still gonna do it. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6833.8s)]
*  Right, so some people like a drink now and again, [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6834.64s)]
*  and I'm sure, I would say do as you want, [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6837.64s)]
*  but know what you're doing. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6841.400000000001s)]
*  But I'd like to talk a little bit about markers [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6843.24s)]
*  that are an outgrowth of this conversation about food, [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6848.12s)]
*  so blood markers. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6851.8s)]
*  So ApoB is one that gets a lot of attention nowadays. [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6853.04s)]
*  For years, all we heard was you want your HDL high, [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6856.4400000000005s)]
*  you want your LDL low. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6859.12s)]
*  Now we also realize that elevated ApoB can be problematic. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6860.96s)]
*  And I and many people I know who eat some meat, [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6867.360000000001s)]
*  it's not meat heavy diet, but some good quality meat. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6872.4400000000005s)]
*  We're not talking about deli meats and things like that. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6875.76s)]
*  Fruit, vegetables and limit starchy carbohydrate intake [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6878.360000000001s)]
*  to some extent, maybe not completely, but to some extent, [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6883.4800000000005s)]
*  have observed elevated ApoB when we do that, [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6886.360000000001s)]
*  including olive oil, butter, coffee, yerba mate, [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6891.4800000000005s)]
*  this kind of thing. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6893.040000000001s)]
*  So healthy diet, largely anti-inflammatory diet, [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6893.88s)]
*  noticed elevated ApoB as compared to when some of that [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6896.76s)]
*  red meat, even if it's grass-fed meat, [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6901.160000000001s)]
*  is replaced with things like fish or chicken and so on, [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6903.4400000000005s)]
*  which makes me wonder if there really is a red meat, [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6907.84s)]
*  again, quality red meat, ApoB link. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6913.080000000001s)]
*  And should I worry if my ApoB is elevated? [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6916.320000000001s)]
*  My ApoB is a little bit elevated, [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6918.76s)]
*  but I haven't yet gone on any prescription drug to lower it. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6920.84s)]
*  I'm taking some other approaches. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6924.04s)]
*  Yeah, it's a great question. [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6925.68s)]
*  And I learned that from Function, [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6927.24s)]
*  and yes, they're the sponsor of this podcast, [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6928.4400000000005s)]
*  but I hadn't had an ApoB test. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6930.04s)]
*  And that was the problem. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6932.2s)]
*  I'd go to the doctor, I'd get a blood panel, [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6933.04s)]
*  and it didn't include ApoB. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6934.76s)]
*  Well, you got like your 19 tests, [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6935.6s)]
*  and they had the same old stuff, [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6937.12s)]
*  and you get your regular cholesterol. [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6938.88s)]
*  It was like high weight, you know. [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6939.72s)]
*  I mean, the regular cholesterol panel is what most doctors [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6941.8s)]
*  use to manage cardiovascular risk, [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6944.4400000000005s)]
*  which is your total, your LDL, HDL, and triglyceride levels. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6946.16s)]
*  That's just like so 20th century. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6950.639999999999s)]
*  The way we look at cardiovascular risk now [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6954.4s)]
*  is way more complicated, [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6955.76s)]
*  and we need to look at the quality of the cholesterol, [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6957.04s)]
*  which is the particle size and number. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6959.84s)]
*  And we were talking earlier about sugar and starch [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6961.8s)]
*  and some resistance. [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6963.88s)]
*  Insulin resistance is essentially a metabolic state [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6965.5199999999995s)]
*  where your body can't respond [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6967.76s)]
*  like it normally should to insulin, [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6970.639999999999s)]
*  and you need more and more insulin [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6972.0s)]
*  to keep your blood sugar normal. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6974.0s)]
*  And that has secondary consequences, [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6976.320000000001s)]
*  which causes your cholesterol to become abnormal. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6978.2s)]
*  So it may not raise your LDL per se, [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6981.72s)]
*  but it'll lower your good cholesterol, triglycerides, [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6984.76s)]
*  or HDL, which there's good and bad HDL, [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6986.72s)]
*  so it's a little more complicated than that. [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6989.0s)]
*  But it'll raise your triglycerides, [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6990.0s)]
*  and it will raise your ApoB. [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6992.72s)]
*  It'll raise your particle number of LDL particles, [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6995.92s)]
*  and it'll make the size of those particles small. [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=6999.24s)]
*  These are all things that people should be testing. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7001.92s)]
*  And you can do all these biomarkers, including ApoB. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7003.68s)]
*  But ApoB, all you can get is an ApoB from your doctor. [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7005.88s)]
*  Even the American Heart Association recognizes this [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7008.56s)]
*  as a better predictor of your risk of having a heart attack [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7011.4400000000005s)]
*  than your LDL cholesterol. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7014.76s)]
*  And yet they're trying to include soda. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7015.88s)]
*  Sorry, had to go back to it. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7017.4400000000005s)]
*  And the way I think about ApoB, [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7019.0s)]
*  because there's really cool tests now. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7021.360000000001s)]
*  You can use mass spec to look at C-peptide and insulin [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7023.0s)]
*  to look at your insulin resistance, which is really cool. [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7025.56s)]
*  But if you can't get that, [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7028.320000000001s)]
*  you can ask your doctor for an ApoB, [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7030.400000000001s)]
*  because it's sort of a surrogate marker [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7031.6s)]
*  for every non-good type of cholesterol particle. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7034.0s)]
*  If that makes sense. [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7038.280000000001s)]
*  So what do you advise somebody if they're ApoB? [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7039.120000000001s)]
*  Is 90 or above? [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7041.52s)]
*  Yeah, so you can test yourself. [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7042.360000000001s)]
*  Everybody's in on one. [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7044.360000000001s)]
*  So the next thing I was gonna say was that [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7045.200000000001s)]
*  we treat all lipids as sort of a uniform approach, [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7047.68s)]
*  which is everybody should drive their LDL over 70. [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7051.68s)]
*  That- Under 70. [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7054.120000000001s)]
*  Under 70, that's what cardiovascular recommendations are. [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7054.96s)]
*  How do you do that? [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7058.400000000001s)]
*  Exercise, nutrition. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7059.240000000001s)]
*  It can be diet, it can be exercise, it can be drugs. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7060.28s)]
*  Are you a fan of statins? [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7064.28s)]
*  Not a big fan, but they're a tool. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7066.0s)]
*  Like, am I a fan of hammers? [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7067.5199999999995s)]
*  Well, yeah, when I need one. [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7069.32s)]
*  But not for everybody. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7072.24s)]
*  And I think the key thing to understand is that [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7073.44s)]
*  if you're looking at your cardiovascular risk, [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7077.0s)]
*  you have to look at the quality [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7078.639999999999s)]
*  of these cholesterol particles. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7079.88s)]
*  And there's also a large amount of variation [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7080.92s)]
*  or heterogeneity in the population [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7084.5199999999995s)]
*  in the response to the exact same food. [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7086.88s)]
*  And I'll just tell you a quick story. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7090.84s)]
*  I had one patient, she was overweight, [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7091.96s)]
*  couldn't lose weight, pre-diabetic, inflamed, [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7095.24s)]
*  and she was really struggling. [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7099.08s)]
*  And I said, well, look, let's try a ketogenic diet. [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7101.96s)]
*  There's good data on it. [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7105.16s)]
*  Let's see what happens. [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7107.08s)]
*  Her cholesterol dropped 100 points, [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7108.4800000000005s)]
*  her triglycerides dropped 200 points, [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7110.72s)]
*  her HDL went up 30 points, she lost 20 pounds, [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7113.16s)]
*  she felt great, her inflammation level's normalized, [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7116.28s)]
*  she did great. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7118.96s)]
*  Another guy heard about a ketogenic diet, [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7120.2s)]
*  he was in his 50s, one of my patients, [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7122.5599999999995s)]
*  elite athlete, was like riding his bike 50 miles a day, [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7125.32s)]
*  he was in his mid-50s, super fit, thin, lean. [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7127.92s)]
*  He said, I wanna try it. [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7131.96s)]
*  I heard it's good for performance. [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7133.599999999999s)]
*  I'm like, okay, but let's monitor your numbers. [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7134.599999999999s)]
*  And we did, and the opposite happened. [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7137.48s)]
*  His total cholesterol went through the roof, [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7140.36s)]
*  his LDL went through the roof, [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7143.28s)]
*  his particle number went up through the roof. [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7144.44s)]
*  I'm like, wow, same diet, different response. [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7145.76s)]
*  And I've talked to Ron Krauss about this, [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7148.88s)]
*  he's from Oakland, you might know about him. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7150.8s)]
*  He discovered the particle size concept. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7152.52s)]
*  He basically used MRI machines, [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7155.52s)]
*  and now he's got a different technology, [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7157.96s)]
*  which measures the quality and the number [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7159.360000000001s)]
*  of your cholesterol particles, not just the weight of them, [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7161.52s)]
*  which is what you get with a regular test. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7163.8s)]
*  And so we saw this variation, [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7166.0s)]
*  and we realize now in the population [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7169.400000000001s)]
*  it depends on who you are. [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7171.24s)]
*  So there's a whole category of people [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7172.280000000001s)]
*  called lean mass hyper responders. [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7173.8s)]
*  You're maybe one of those where you're fit, [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7176.28s)]
*  you're healthy, you're athletic, [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7177.96s)]
*  and you eat saturated fat and boom, [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7179.52s)]
*  your numbers kinda go wacky. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7182.24s)]
*  Or you could be an overweight diabetic person, [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7185.04s)]
*  and they do the opposite. [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7188.12s)]
*  Like you'll lower your LDL, like this woman. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7189.88s)]
*  So it depends on your metabolic type, [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7192.16s)]
*  on your level of insulin resistance, [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7194.68s)]
*  on your overall health, and people can switch over. [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7196.16s)]
*  So let's say you're an overweight diabetic [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7197.84s)]
*  and you become ripped and healthy and fit, [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7199.320000000001s)]
*  then the same food might have an opposite effect [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7201.28s)]
*  on you at that point. [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7203.68s)]
*  And it all has to do with cholesterol transport, [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7204.84s)]
*  cholesterol synthesis in the liver. [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7207.08s)]
*  It's kinda a little complicated scientifically. [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7208.72s)]
*  I know you might have a guy named Nick Norwitz [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7210.320000000001s)]
*  from Harvard on the podcast, who's great. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7211.8s)]
*  He can talk about this all day long. [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7213.64s)]
*  Nick has great online content. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7215.280000000001s)]
*  Folks should check out Nick Norwitz's [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7216.92s)]
*  ex and Instagram handle. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7219.12s)]
*  Very smart kid. [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7221.12s)]
*  Very smart kid, very spirited. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7222.64s)]
*  I've encouraged him from the first time [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7224.68s)]
*  I saw his content to keep going. [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7226.76s)]
*  Yeah, he's great. [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7228.200000000001s)]
*  He's like, he's an Oxford PhD in metabolism. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7229.04s)]
*  He's got Harvard MDs, graduating medical school. [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7231.360000000001s)]
*  And he's not afraid to go against the grain. [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7234.6s)]
*  He just goes with his experience and the data. [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7235.92s)]
*  Yeah, and you're speaking about different diets [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7238.320000000001s)]
*  for people. [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7239.96s)]
*  He had colitis and almost died. [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7240.8s)]
*  He went on a carnivore slash keto diet [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7241.64s)]
*  and actually ended up curing it [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7243.64s)]
*  and is fit and healthy now. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7246.200000000001s)]
*  But his cholesterol, his LDL went up to 500. [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7248.08s)]
*  Is that where it sits now? [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7250.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7252.04s)]
*  And so there's a whole group of these people [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7253.04s)]
*  that have LDLs that are through the roof [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7254.96s)]
*  who would make most cardiologists have a heart attack [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7256.84s)]
*  just looking at the number. [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7259.12s)]
*  So what do we do? [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7260.4800000000005s)]
*  Let's say someone takes a ApoB test. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7261.64s)]
*  What we do. [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7263.88s)]
*  Or from their doctor and they've got an ApoB, [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7264.72s)]
*  let's like 110. [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7267.400000000001s)]
*  What do you do? [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7268.92s)]
*  Well, the NIH basically is great. [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7269.76s)]
*  They now said that the end of one research [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7271.0s)]
*  is among the highest quality research. [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7272.84s)]
*  And what that means is you compared to you, right? [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7274.200000000001s)]
*  I don't wanna compare myself to a 70 kilogram white male [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7277.52s)]
*  from Kansas or some five foot tall woman from like, [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7279.72s)]
*  I don't know, like Afghanistan. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7285.320000000001s)]
*  We're all different. [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7287.200000000001s)]
*  And so we need to see what happens to our biology. [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7288.320000000001s)]
*  That's why I believe tests don't guess. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7290.84s)]
*  And do something, follow it up and track it. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7292.32s)]
*  How often? [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7295.72s)]
*  Depends on what you're doing. [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7296.72s)]
*  Lipids change very quickly. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7297.68s)]
*  Typical person. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7299.4800000000005s)]
*  Lipids can change within a month. [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7300.32s)]
*  So I give people a month of changing a diet [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7301.8s)]
*  or changing a lifestyle or behavior to see what happens. [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7303.56s)]
*  Vitamin D can take longer. [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7306.04s)]
*  If you're low, it can take up to three months to rebuild. [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7307.28s)]
*  If your iron is low, it can take three months [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7309.16s)]
*  to rebuild your iron. [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7311.08s)]
*  So it depends on the test. [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7311.92s)]
*  But you can quickly see changes in your insulin resistance, [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7312.96s)]
*  in your insulin levels, in your blood sugar levels, [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7316.96s)]
*  in your lipid levels by changing diet. [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7319.84s)]
*  But you have to be systematic, right? [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7322.92s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7324.400000000001s)]
*  I mean, I had a patient who was, [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7325.24s)]
*  I have a program called the 10 Day Detox Diet. [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7327.12s)]
*  It was essentially a whole foods diet [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7329.0s)]
*  which eliminates a lot of the inflammatory foods [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7331.56s)]
*  that are problematic for people. [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7333.56s)]
*  And it creates an incredible quick response. [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7334.96s)]
*  It's like, I call it setting your body back [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7338.400000000001s)]
*  to its original factory settings. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7340.32s)]
*  And she was like, I wanna check my blood after 10 days. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7342.64s)]
*  I'm like, no, it's gonna be a waste of money. [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7344.6s)]
*  We shouldn't do it. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7346.84s)]
*  Your numbers aren't gonna change that much. [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7347.68s)]
*  But she insisted. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7349.52s)]
*  And I was like, okay. [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7350.64s)]
*  And she did. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7352.080000000001s)]
*  And the numbers just dramatically changed. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7352.92s)]
*  Her lipids, her insulin, her blood sugar, [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7354.280000000001s)]
*  inflammation levels. [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7356.400000000001s)]
*  So the body is like, you change the inputs [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7357.52s)]
*  and the outputs change dramatically. [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7359.92s)]
*  So I think it's really about finding out [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7361.64s)]
*  what's going on for you. [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7363.360000000001s)]
*  So, Andrew, I'd say, well, try to go off of meat [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7364.4400000000005s)]
*  and see what happens to your ABLB [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7366.88s)]
*  or try to add more this kind of fat. [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7367.96s)]
*  I started eating more tuna [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7370.360000000001s)]
*  and eating a little bit less beef. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7371.84s)]
*  And then I did a function test [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7373.84s)]
*  and I discovered my mercury was elevated. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7375.56s)]
*  By the way, I learned something the hard way also [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7377.68s)]
*  a few years prior to that, which is, [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7380.88s)]
*  I know this sounds crazy, but check your dishwasher. [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7383.52s)]
*  Some of them have mercury thermometers that are leaky. [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7385.92s)]
*  Now, I was told the mercury from the mercury thermometers [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7389.96s)]
*  in dishwashers is biologically inert, [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7393.320000000001s)]
*  but I'll tell you, it's not pleasant to see [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7396.200000000001s)]
*  a bunch of little mercury beads floating around [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7397.96s)]
*  on your dishes. [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7400.200000000001s)]
*  Considering it's the most potent toxin known to humans [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7401.320000000001s)]
*  other than plutonium, [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7403.84s)]
*  I would probably avoid all forms of mercury. [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7404.76s)]
*  So do you eat tuna? [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7407.28s)]
*  Rarely. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7408.8s)]
*  Oh, I love tuna sushi. [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7409.88s)]
*  And Raleigh. [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7411.04s)]
*  Okay. [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7411.88s)]
*  But I actually have little hacks [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7412.719999999999s)]
*  where you can take a chelating drug [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7416.599999999999s)]
*  after you go to a sushi restaurant. [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7418.16s)]
*  Like what? [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7419.12s)]
*  DMSA, it's FDA approved drug for heavy metal chelation. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7419.96s)]
*  Prescription? [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7422.88s)]
*  Prescription, yeah. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7423.719999999999s)]
*  DMSA? [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7424.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7425.38s)]
*  Okay. [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7426.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7427.0599999999995s)]
*  What dosage? [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7427.88s)]
*  Depends, you can do like 500 milligrams or 200. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7428.719999999999s)]
*  You'll take that after you go out to sushi? [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7430.88s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's kind of like a doctor hack I can do [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7432.4s)]
*  where you can ask your doctor for it. [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7435.68s)]
*  I don't recommend it. [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7437.320000000001s)]
*  It's like, you know. [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7438.6s)]
*  Well, as long as we're on this, [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7440.08s)]
*  I love the range of topics we're touching into today, [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7441.200000000001s)]
*  by the way. [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7445.0s)]
*  By the way, I almost died from mercury poisoning. [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7445.84s)]
*  So I know how to manage it, how my body works. [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7446.96s)]
*  I've checked my genes and why I don't detox. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7449.16s)]
*  This is from the China. [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7451.04s)]
*  Yeah, I know how to upregulate my detox pathways [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7452.0s)]
*  through food, through supplements. [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7454.08s)]
*  Are you a fan of sulforaphane? [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7455.52s)]
*  When I did the episode on microplastics and P-flasses, [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7457.360000000001s)]
*  I started taking sulforaphane [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7461.12s)]
*  and increasing my cruciferous vegetable intake. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7462.4400000000005s)]
*  Upregulates glutathione, [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7464.68s)]
*  which is the body's main detoxifying compound. [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7465.8s)]
*  So do you also take N-acetylcysteine? [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7468.64s)]
*  I do, yeah. [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7470.64s)]
*  Daily? [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7471.4800000000005s)]
*  Daily, yeah. [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7472.320000000001s)]
*  How much? [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7473.14s)]
*  600. [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7473.9800000000005s)]
*  600 milligrams? [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7474.820000000001s)]
*  Okay, I'll do three or four times that [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7475.64s)]
*  if I feel a cold coming on, but I don't take it daily. [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7477.360000000001s)]
*  I should probably take it daily. [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7480.68s)]
*  Well, considering we live in a toxic soup, [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7481.68s)]
*  I mean, we just can't get away from it. [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7484.92s)]
*  In the air, the water, the food. [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7486.4800000000005s)]
*  N-acetylcysteine, we already talked about the omegas [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7488.4400000000005s)]
*  and the basics, magnesium, et cetera. [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7490.8s)]
*  What are some things that when people start to hit [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7493.56s)]
*  their 40s, 50s, 60s that you think they should add in [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7497.4400000000005s)]
*  for their health? [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7503.08s)]
*  And is there anything female specific or male specific? [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7504.360000000001s)]
*  For sure. [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7508.12s)]
*  I mean, you know, what's really frightening, Andrew, [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7508.96s)]
*  is that because of the diet we have, [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7511.92s)]
*  which is hormonally regulating, [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7516.240000000001s)]
*  sugar and starch tend to screw up [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7519.08s)]
*  both men's and women's hormones. [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7521.08s)]
*  It makes women more like men and men more like women. [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7522.84s)]
*  So you get PCOS in women, which is hair growth on your face, [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7525.72s)]
*  loss of hair on your head, and androgen. [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7530.2s)]
*  Androgen. [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7533.44s)]
*  Yeah, and then for men, their testosterone goes down. [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7534.28s)]
*  The bigger your belly, the lower your testosterone. [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7537.06s)]
*  So when you eat starch or sugar, you get belly fat. [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7539.7s)]
*  So I mean, young men have low testosterone. [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7542.68s)]
*  I would have said, if you asked me 20 years ago, [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7545.96s)]
*  I would have said, well, you know, [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7549.16s)]
*  you're checking in your 40s and seeing the change that [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7550.0s)]
*  happened, but now I think we got to start looking earlier. [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7551.76s)]
*  And a lot of guys are getting on TRT Young. [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7554.32s)]
*  I'm on a bit of a campaign now to discourage that. [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7557.04s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think it's a good idea. [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7560.52s)]
*  I think that if they're doing everything right, [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7561.36s)]
*  like eating right and exercising, [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7562.52s)]
*  and that doesn't mean over-exercising. [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7564.56s)]
*  If you over train, like you're running, running, running, [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7566.04s)]
*  your testosterone is going to be diminished for sure. [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7568.0s)]
*  But encouraging them to do everything they can [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7572.08s)]
*  with behaviors and include nutrition and some [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7574.28s)]
*  supplementation before getting on TRT because of the- [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7576.88s)]
*  Reduction in sperm count that comes from TRT, [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7580.200000000001s)]
*  unless you offset it with HCG. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7582.88s)]
*  So, you know, I've said before in the podcast, [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7584.92s)]
*  I take 25 milligrams of Cipionate every other day, [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7587.4800000000005s)]
*  staggered with HCG, 600 IU every other day. [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7590.72s)]
*  I've been open about that from the beginning, [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7593.4400000000005s)]
*  but I started at age 45. [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7595.92s)]
*  And I do free sperm every year, [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7598.56s)]
*  just because there's some age-related effects on sperm. [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7601.400000000001s)]
*  And like, why not? [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7603.84s)]
*  It's very inexpensive to cryopreserve. [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7604.780000000001s)]
*  But I think young guys are, [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7607.12s)]
*  it's scary that their testosterone is so low. [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7609.28s)]
*  Especially if they're not overweight. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7611.88s)]
*  So what's going on? [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7613.28s)]
*  Well, also there's endocrine-disrupting chemicals. [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7615.04s)]
*  So, her heavy metals, pesticides. [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7617.599999999999s)]
*  A lot of these are what we call xenobiotics, [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7619.599999999999s)]
*  meaning they're foreign kind of compounds [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7622.24s)]
*  that are biologically active. [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7625.72s)]
*  And there's a whole book on this that I read [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7627.0s)]
*  almost 30 years ago called Our Stolen Future [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7629.76s)]
*  by Theo Colburn, which lays out, [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7631.96s)]
*  it was kind of like the Rachel Carson [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7634.16s)]
*  Silent Spring version of a few years ago, [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7636.08s)]
*  which talked about the reproductive effects [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7639.08s)]
*  of these petrochemical toxins that are everywhere [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7641.04s)]
*  in our food, in our water, in our air. [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7644.08s)]
*  And they affect fertility rates, [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7645.8s)]
*  they affect birth rates in terms of male or female. [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7648.2s)]
*  Shana Swan was on this podcast. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7650.32s)]
*  And gosh, if it wasn't for her and her incredible work [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7652.44s)]
*  and the fact that she's such a skeptic of any data [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7655.82s)]
*  that I don't think people would respect [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7659.36s)]
*  the data on pesticides as much as they do, [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7663.12s)]
*  because I think it took somebody [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7666.4400000000005s)]
*  with her kind of front-facing image to, [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7668.16s)]
*  she talks a lot about the environmental working group [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7671.64s)]
*  and the real hardcore science types are like, [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7674.52s)]
*  oh, they're anti-environmental working group. [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7677.0s)]
*  I was shocked to learn that a lot of people [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7679.24s)]
*  in the scientific community are like [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7680.96s)]
*  anti-environmental working group. [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7682.24s)]
*  I thought, how could that possibly be? [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7683.72s)]
*  They call it woo science. [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7685.16s)]
*  I mean, the politics and all this are really complicated, [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7686.68s)]
*  but what do you do to remove heavy metals? [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7688.72s)]
*  Just to answer your question about [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7693.4800000000005s)]
*  what you should be testing. [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7694.64s)]
*  I think most people should be testing, [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7695.4800000000005s)]
*  depending on where you are and what age you are, [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7698.0s)]
*  but your hormonal panels on a regular basis. [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7699.320000000001s)]
*  So sex hormones, male would be free testosterone, [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7702.200000000001s)]
*  total testosterone, estradiol. [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7706.4800000000005s)]
*  DHT as well. [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7708.0s)]
*  DHT, sometimes if you have hair loss, [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7708.84s)]
*  that can be treated for men. [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7711.6s)]
*  For women, same thing, they need FSH, LH, [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7712.88s)]
*  sex hormones like estradiol, progesterone, [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7717.16s)]
*  testosterone for women as well, [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7719.8s)]
*  DHA, sulfate, which can be an indicator of PCOS. [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7721.36s)]
*  And we're seeing when they're functioning, [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7724.92s)]
*  we've got 150,000 members now. [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7726.4s)]
*  We have literally 10s. [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7728.12s)]
*  150,000. [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7729.4s)]
*  150,000. [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7730.24s)]
*  We have tens of millions of biological data points. [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7731.08s)]
*  And we can see anonymized data [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7734.12s)]
*  showing the trends in the population, [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7736.16s)]
*  and it's not good. [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7738.0s)]
*  And then the good news is you can do something about it. [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7739.44s)]
*  Can insurance cover a blood test like function? [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7742.12s)]
*  Yes, if you get your health savings account [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7744.4s)]
*  or your FSAs, you can use those [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7746.88s)]
*  for function health testing. [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7750.68s)]
*  But if you don't have that and you can't use that, [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7752.32s)]
*  regular insurance doesn't cover it yet. [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7755.64s)]
*  I'm hoping we're gonna change that. [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7757.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, is that in the cards? [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7758.8s)]
*  That's in the roadmap for sure. [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7760.24s)]
*  Because once we can prove that we create value, [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7762.76s)]
*  and we're seeing this, when people use function, [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7764.72s)]
*  they get their lab tests done, [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7766.4400000000005s)]
*  and then we follow them for every six months. [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7767.72s)]
*  And we can see the changes in the biomarkers [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7769.88s)]
*  toward the positive, how many people go [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7771.68s)]
*  from abnormal to normal. [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7773.04s)]
*  And it's not just by knowing their tests. [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7774.4400000000005s)]
*  There's tens of thousands of pages of content [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7775.88s)]
*  that have been highly curated and scientifically referenced [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7778.64s)]
*  on what to do if you have this or that normal biomarker. [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7781.04s)]
*  So you ask me, what do I do for mercury? [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7784.2s)]
*  If you get a positive mercury, [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7786.96s)]
*  and you double clicked on that, [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7788.24s)]
*  you would get a very deep analysis of what you need to do. [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7789.88s)]
*  Here's the way to reduce your exposures [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7792.84s)]
*  through your water and air. [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7794.72s)]
*  Here's how you reduce your exposure through food [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7796.8s)]
*  by reducing these kinds of fish, [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7798.36s)]
*  eating more of these kinds of fish. [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7799.72s)]
*  Are you a fan of using charcoal as a chelator? [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7800.96s)]
*  I don't think charcoal's great for heavy metals, no. [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7803.400000000001s)]
*  I think it's good for binding anything. [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7806.72s)]
*  So we use it. [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7808.88s)]
*  How does one take charcoal? [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7809.72s)]
*  I've been a little bit cautious about taking charcoal. [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7810.72s)]
*  You can take it as capsules. [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7812.56s)]
*  When I was in the ER though, [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7813.400000000001s)]
*  we used to use it if people came with a drug overdose. [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7814.320000000001s)]
*  We'd make them drink a cup of charcoal, literally. [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7816.0s)]
*  Their teeth would turn black, it was awful. [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7818.400000000001s)]
*  So if I try to kill yourself in as punishment [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7819.88s)]
*  for trying to kill yourself. [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7822.16s)]
*  So this is gallows humor that only a physician [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7823.360000000001s)]
*  could laugh at. [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7827.08s)]
*  I know a number of physicians, [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7829.12s)]
*  and they all have this gallows humor. [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7830.4800000000005s)]
*  I think it's a survival tactic. [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7832.0s)]
*  You have to, you have to, [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7833.12s)]
*  because you're like in situations [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7834.12s)]
*  which would make you otherwise go crazy. [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7835.2s)]
*  Let's say I want to remove some heavy metals [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7836.96s)]
*  and toxins from the body. [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7839.88s)]
*  I could take a charcoal tablet. [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7841.16s)]
*  No, you can take a tablet, but I wouldn't do that. [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7842.8s)]
*  What I would say is one, reduce your exposures, number one. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7845.16s)]
*  You're eating tuna, big fish. [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7847.32s)]
*  It's basically, the bigger the fish, [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7849.68s)]
*  the more the mercury. [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7852.04s)]
*  I don't eat much tuna anymore. [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7853.16s)]
*  So small fish, I call it the smashes. [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7855.12s)]
*  Small wild salmon, mackerel, anchovies, sardines, and harry. [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7857.92s)]
*  I hate all those. [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7862.16s)]
*  All your favorite fish. [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7863.0s)]
*  I hate all those. [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7864.68s)]
*  But is there anything I can take? [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7865.52s)]
*  So here's what I would do. [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7867.04s)]
*  I would, you know, there's a, [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7867.88s)]
*  I don't have any relationship with this company. [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7870.2s)]
*  It's called SeaTopia.fish. [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7871.72s)]
*  It sources fish around the world from regeneratively. [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7873.400000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah, I've seen their stuff. [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7875.88s)]
*  Regenerative fish farms. [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7876.72s)]
*  So it's farmed, but it's healthy. [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7878.64s)]
*  And it doesn't have all the heavy metals, [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7881.08s)]
*  and you can get good fish. [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7882.76s)]
*  There are some small tuna farms that are like smaller tunas [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7884.68s)]
*  where they actually do this too, [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7888.32s)]
*  but they don't source from there. [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7890.84s)]
*  Second is I would upregulate [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7892.72s)]
*  all of your endogenous detox pathways. [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7895.280000000001s)]
*  So this, your body has a system of elimination. [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7897.4800000000005s)]
*  When doctors say detox is bullshit, [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7900.4400000000005s)]
*  baloney, you poop, you pee, you sweat. [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7902.240000000001s)]
*  You sweat. [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7905.6s)]
*  Like this is your liver has a whole series of pathways [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7906.4400000000005s)]
*  that are detoxification pathways. [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7909.4800000000005s)]
*  Your kidney does, your gut does. [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7911.04s)]
*  I mean, this is what your body does, right? [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7913.16s)]
*  Your poop, pee, sweat, you know, all these things. [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7915.320000000001s)]
*  So you have to upregulate their body's own system. [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7918.08s)]
*  So you need to take foods that upregulate your liver. [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7920.6s)]
*  You mentioned eating more crisp surface vegetables. [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7922.96s)]
*  You could add more garlic. [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7924.68s)]
*  You could actually juice cilantro. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7925.96s)]
*  It's a great hack for getting rid of heavy metals. [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7927.360000000001s)]
*  Really? [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7930.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it doesn't taste very good. [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7931.240000000001s)]
*  I like cilantro. [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7932.08s)]
*  By juicing like a couple of bunches of that every day [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7932.96s)]
*  will help bring it down. [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7935.200000000001s)]
*  And then there are things like fiber to help bind it. [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7936.84s)]
*  So you talked about charcoal, that's a binder, [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7940.6s)]
*  but just eating a higher fiber diet [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7942.360000000001s)]
*  will help you eliminate things faster through your colon, [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7944.160000000001s)]
*  like heavy metals. [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7946.84s)]
*  And then- [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7947.96s)]
*  Do you believe in gut cleanses? [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7948.8s)]
*  There's this, I don't know if I, [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7950.04s)]
*  I want to just talk about it. [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7952.4s)]
*  There's this fermented plum product [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7953.72s)]
*  that someone gave me. Umboshi plum? [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7958.48s)]
*  No, it comes in a beautiful packaging, [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7959.44s)]
*  like this orange and black packaging. [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7961.48s)]
*  It's a fermented plum or pomelo [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7963.0s)]
*  that a friend of mine said, [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7965.48s)]
*  listen, you have to stay home the next day, [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7967.0s)]
*  but you take this before you go to sleep, [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7969.24s)]
*  you drink like 16 ounces of water, you go to sleep. [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7971.48s)]
*  You wake up in the morning [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7974.96s)]
*  and you're not going anywhere that day [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7976.36s)]
*  except a few trips to the bathroom, [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7978.36s)]
*  but it completely empties your digestive tract. [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7980.04s)]
*  Well, then you can get a colonoscopy [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7983.28s)]
*  and get that too through the prep. [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7984.36s)]
*  Yeah, so it's not something that I, [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7985.639999999999s)]
*  well, I tried it because I was like, [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7988.0s)]
*  all right, I'll give this a try. [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7989.16s)]
*  Is it healthy or unhealthy or neutral [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7990.2s)]
*  to do a complete digestive tract emptying? [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7993.44s)]
*  I mean, I think it depends how you do it [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7996.4s)]
*  and what's causing it, like, you know, [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=7998.44s)]
*  but it can disrupt your gut flora. [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8000.16s)]
*  So your gut will really repopulate often [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8002.88s)]
*  with the flora that it had, [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8005.16s)]
*  but, you know, part of the reason we're so sick [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8006.84s)]
*  is our gut flora is so harmed by C-sections, [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8009.24s)]
*  antibiotics, lack of breastfeeding. [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8012.400000000001s)]
*  The infant formula itself is a microbiome [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8014.52s)]
*  harmful compound for many reasons, [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8017.8s)]
*  not saying women shouldn't use formula, [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8019.4400000000005s)]
*  but there's better formulas and worse formulas. [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8020.76s)]
*  And so we kind of like had a lot of gut issues. [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8023.04s)]
*  We've taken antibiotics, we've eaten food [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8026.2s)]
*  that's harmful to our microbiome, [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8028.76s)]
*  we are exposed to toxins. [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8030.4800000000005s)]
*  So somebody might want to flush their system. [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8031.32s)]
*  I think it can be helpful, and for example, [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8033.12s)]
*  we do this, for example, if people have liver failure [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8036.04s)]
*  and you're an alcoholic and you have liver failure, [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8039.6s)]
*  now liver failure comes mostly from eating sugar and starch. [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8041.28s)]
*  They changed the name, by the way, [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8044.92s)]
*  from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8045.84s)]
*  to metabolic associated fatty liver disease, [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8048.72s)]
*  which is just kind of, so yeah. [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8052.08s)]
*  And so those people, if they come in with liver failure, [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8053.92s)]
*  they get crazy, literally. [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8057.16s)]
*  It's called hepatic encephalopathy. [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8058.92s)]
*  You get delirium, they are seeing things, [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8060.36s)]
*  they literally go nuts. [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8062.2s)]
*  The treatment, you give them a sterilizing antibiotics, [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8063.72s)]
*  you kill everything in their gut, called neomycin, [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8066.88s)]
*  and then you give them lactulose, [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8069.64s)]
*  which makes you poop your brains out. [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8070.76s)]
*  And then they basically flush all that out, [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8072.68s)]
*  and all the toxins that you can't metabolize [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8074.68s)]
*  from your microbiome get flushed out [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8076.88s)]
*  and you come back to normal cognition. [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8079.320000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8082.0s)]
*  And it's a standard medical treatment. [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8082.84s)]
*  It's like basically what you learn in medical school. [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8083.76s)]
*  So there is an argument, and I've done this [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8086.12s)]
*  with autistic kids who've had gut issues [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8088.240000000001s)]
*  with certain different issues. [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8090.280000000001s)]
*  Parkinson's, if you're constipated, [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8091.84s)]
*  goes up by, your risk goes up by 400%, [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8093.88s)]
*  and that's a toxin-related neurological disease. [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8096.4800000000005s)]
*  Well, this thing is a hammer. [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8099.56s)]
*  But have you ever? [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8101.8s)]
*  It was sort of given to me as a joke, [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8102.64s)]
*  and I thought, all right, well, this is gonna be no good. [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8104.24s)]
*  You're gonna be fine, don't worry. [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8106.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, no, I only did it twice on separate occasions. [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8107.360000000001s)]
*  And I was like, okay, that wasn't super pleasant, [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8112.08s)]
*  but I just wanted to know, is it a valuable tool? [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8115.64s)]
*  And I wasn't interested in taking a drug, [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8120.12s)]
*  and it's like this fermented fruit or something like that. [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8121.88s)]
*  I did hear that from a colleague at Yale [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8124.5599999999995s)]
*  who studies the microbiome that if we fast, [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8127.08s)]
*  or if we evacuate our digestive tract [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8130.36s)]
*  in kind of an aggressive way like that, [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8132.64s)]
*  that the healthy microbiome [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8134.68s)]
*  needs some time to replenish itself. [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8136.44s)]
*  It's not like you, like when you fast, [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8138.32s)]
*  you start eating away at the unhealthy and healthy microbiota [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8140.12s)]
*  or they aren't fed. [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8143.8s)]
*  And so it's not across the board a good thing necessarily. [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8145.44s)]
*  Yeah, so you wanna be careful of that. [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8148.76s)]
*  But I think in terms of answering your question [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8150.12s)]
*  about metals, so you wanna upregulate, [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8153.72s)]
*  you reduce your exposure, [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8156.0s)]
*  you wanna upregulate your pathways by food, [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8156.96s)]
*  and then you can upregulate the pathways by nutrients. [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8159.400000000001s)]
*  So we talked about N-acetylcysteine, [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8161.68s)]
*  so anything that boosts glutathione, like poic acid, [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8163.72s)]
*  all the methylated B vitamins, B12, folate, B6, [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8167.16s)]
*  making sure you have enough protein, [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8169.84s)]
*  because a lot of the phase two pathways in your liver [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8171.08s)]
*  that help you detoxify are dependent on amino acids, [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8173.0s)]
*  like Euclidionidation and glutathione. [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8176.8s)]
*  It's an important detoxifying compound, [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8179.6s)]
*  and you wanna basically open up all the pathways [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8181.280000000001s)]
*  to get rid of it. [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8183.52s)]
*  So I have a very specific detox protocol for heavy metals, [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8184.360000000001s)]
*  includes all that, and sometimes DMSA, and binders. [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8186.84s)]
*  But I use silica, I use alginates from seaweed and others. [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8190.280000000001s)]
*  I don't use charcoal for that. [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8193.64s)]
*  But you can safely remove metals from your body. [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8194.92s)]
*  That's what happened to me. [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8197.12s)]
*  I was able to do it, and I'm not demented anymore. [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8197.960000000001s)]
*  I don't have chronic fatigue syndrome. [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8202.44s)]
*  And if you look at pictures of me in my 30s, [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8204.04s)]
*  you're like, wow, you look terrible. [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8205.64s)]
*  Well, I met you 10 years ago. [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8207.2s)]
*  And you truly have aged backwards. [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8210.36s)]
*  And you look great then, you look super vibrant then. [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8213.68s)]
*  You have a ton of energy. [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8215.640000000001s)]
*  I mean, I think you embody a lot of the things [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8217.36s)]
*  that people would like for healthy aging, [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8219.36s)]
*  and I know you also exercise, and you do all the things. [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8221.400000000001s)]
*  I'd like to talk about some of the more cutting edge things [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8225.2s)]
*  that are happening that I've not tried, [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8229.28s)]
*  but that I'm curious about. [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8232.02s)]
*  And you wanna know if I've done them or not? [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8235.04s)]
*  Or maybe, or just what- [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8236.56s)]
*  I've tried everything pretty much. [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8237.8s)]
*  Actually, something I have tried, [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8239.8s)]
*  but that I'm not an expert on, [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8241.44s)]
*  but we've done a couple of podcasts about, [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8243.16s)]
*  but I'd like your thoughts on peptides. [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8244.72s)]
*  What are some of the peptides that you think [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8246.8s)]
*  can be useful to people if they can afford them [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8248.8s)]
*  and work with a doctor where they can get it safely? [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8251.119999999999s)]
*  Let's just assume all that. [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8252.96s)]
*  What are the peptides that you think are of real value [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8255.4s)]
*  to people who aren't really sick [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8258.199999999999s)]
*  but are doing everything they can? [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8260.44s)]
*  Optimization. [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8261.92s)]
*  Yeah, optimization and just generally trying to point [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8262.76s)]
*  all the boats in the direction of health. [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8265.62s)]
*  And it depends on what your needs are, [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8267.58s)]
*  what's happening with your health, [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8268.900000000001s)]
*  and like anything you're using, [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8269.740000000002s)]
*  it should be used for a purpose, right? [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8271.42s)]
*  And peptides are simply mini proteins [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8273.86s)]
*  that have biological effects. [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8276.900000000001s)]
*  And I think of them as your body's super high wave [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8278.140000000001s)]
*  information and connectivity that drives everything. [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8282.1s)]
*  So they regulate your sex hormones, your growth hormone, [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8284.900000000001s)]
*  your metabolic health, nerve function, sexual desire. [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8288.740000000002s)]
*  I mean, there's a million peptides, [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8293.78s)]
*  like GLP-1 is a peptide, insulin's a peptide, right? [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8295.82s)]
*  So there are tens of thousands of peptides [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8299.42s)]
*  that are made by the body that are used [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8302.38s)]
*  to regulate everything. [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8304.26s)]
*  And so there's a number of them that have been available [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8306.38s)]
*  that have been studied well. [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8308.66s)]
*  Some of them are on the market like, you know, [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8309.699999999999s)]
*  Ozambique or insulin or bilisi, [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8311.42s)]
*  which is something called PT-141. [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8313.82s)]
*  It's for hyposexual women, right? [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8316.46s)]
*  Yeah, for women, but you guys are for men. [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8318.66s)]
*  It works for, well. [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8319.98s)]
*  But it's FDA approved for women. [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8320.82s)]
*  It's FDA approved for women. [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8321.98s)]
*  It works for men too. [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8323.78s)]
*  Is it KissPeptin? [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8324.62s)]
*  Is that what it is? [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8325.460000000001s)]
*  No, it's not KissPeptin. [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8326.300000000001s)]
*  It's, I'm gonna butcher the name. [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8327.14s)]
*  It's like, it starts with a B, [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8328.460000000001s)]
*  bleminaletide or something like that. [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8330.62s)]
*  And you know, it does make you nauseous. [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8332.58s)]
*  So you need to take, actually be careful. [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8335.5s)]
*  You don't wanna throw up while you're having sex. [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8337.5s)]
*  Definitely not. [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8339.78s)]
*  Not too sexy, but it does work. [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8340.62s)]
*  But there's a number, depending on your needs. [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8344.02s)]
*  For example, if you're athletic and you're, you know, [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8345.74s)]
*  in the gym a lot, you wanna increase recovery and repair. [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8348.26s)]
*  There's peptides like BPC 157 and TB 500 and GHK [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8351.18s)]
*  that are regulatory peptides for tissue repair and healing. [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8357.54s)]
*  There are peptides that you can use for immune function [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8361.54s)]
*  like thymus and alpha one, [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8364.220000000001s)]
*  which is great if you're getting a cold [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8365.720000000001s)]
*  or you have an immune issue or you have COVID or. [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8367.58s)]
*  What's the pathway for thymus and alpha? [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8370.7s)]
*  We don't have to go through every biochemical step, [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8375.34s)]
*  but is the logic there that you're increasing [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8377.24s)]
*  the number, excuse me, of T cells and B cells? [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8379.02s)]
*  Yeah, so basically, you know, when you're born, [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8381.78s)]
*  you have a giant thymus gland, [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8384.58s)]
*  which like takes up your whole chest. [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8385.98s)]
*  And. Really? [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8387.78s)]
*  Yeah, if you look at a baby, [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8388.66s)]
*  just take a Google image and put it up there. [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8390.300000000001s)]
*  It's like basically like your whole sternum, [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8392.300000000001s)]
*  it's like this big. [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8394.62s)]
*  But it involutes or shrinks as you get older [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8395.66s)]
*  and it kind of becomes smaller. [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8397.62s)]
*  But it's still a source of your immune function [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8398.66s)]
*  and it helps with building your immune resilience. [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8400.42s)]
*  And as we age, it gets worse and worse. [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8403.34s)]
*  And so the thymus alpha one does increase [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8405.42s)]
*  your white blood cell function and number [[02:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8408.34s)]
*  and it helps improve that. [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8411.34s)]
*  Then there's peptides that are like a great, [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8413.66s)]
*  like PT-141 for sexual function. [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8415.38s)]
*  There's peptides like kissapeptine [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8417.460000000001s)]
*  that increases testosterone. [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8418.98s)]
*  There's ones like ipamorlin, that intestamorlin [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8420.22s)]
*  that may help growth hormone. [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8422.9s)]
*  Do you take it? [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8424.22s)]
*  You don't have to share what you take, [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8425.86s)]
*  but do you think any of these are kind of mainstays [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8426.9s)]
*  for people over 40 if they can afford them? [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8430.42s)]
*  Some of them, I think, but you have to be careful [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8433.1s)]
*  because they're not like just taking a vitamin. [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8434.8s)]
*  I mean, if you take an overdose of vitamin E, [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8438.4s)]
*  you'll get in trouble. [[02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8440.24s)]
*  If you have other fat-soluble vitamins [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8441.84s)]
*  like vitamin A, you'll get in trouble. [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8443.4s)]
*  Most water-soluble vitamins, you're not gonna get in trouble. [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8444.599999999999s)]
*  Although beef sticks, you have to be careful [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8446.72s)]
*  with an overdose. [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8448.199999999999s)]
*  And magnesium, if you take too much of it, [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8450.32s)]
*  you just poop your brains out. [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8451.64s)]
*  So vitamin C, the same thing. [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8452.8s)]
*  So your body can manage. [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8455.08s)]
*  But peptides are very powerful compounds. [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8456.22s)]
*  I mean, look at ozempic. [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8458.519999999999s)]
*  I mean, look at insulin. [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8459.439999999999s)]
*  I mean, these are very powerful compounds. [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8460.64s)]
*  Not to be messed around. [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8462.119999999999s)]
*  No, so you really need someone who's educated in it well. [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8463.08s)]
*  And they should be usually a doctor [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8466.44s)]
*  or some licensed professional [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8468.039999999999s)]
*  who has studied and understands this. [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8469.8s)]
*  And they should be used with monitoring [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8471.72s)]
*  to the side effects, the effects, [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8473.48s)]
*  the effects on your lab work and hormones. [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8475.8s)]
*  What about cycling them? [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8477.32s)]
*  Yeah, so you don't want to necessarily [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8478.84s)]
*  take them all the time. [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8480.24s)]
*  And you want to do cycle, [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8481.08s)]
*  particularly ones that stimulate things like growth hormone. [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8481.92s)]
*  You don't want to be on that all the time. [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8483.96s)]
*  I worry about BPC-157 because in my experience, [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8485.2s)]
*  it is effective at treating minor injuries [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8488.46s)]
*  and things like that. [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8491.44s)]
*  People now just take it continuously. [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8492.400000000001s)]
*  And it increases angiogenesis, [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8494.800000000001s)]
*  growth of capillaries and vessels and things like that. [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8497.52s)]
*  And if you have a tumor, [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8499.92s)]
*  you do not want to increase angiogenesis to the tumor. [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8500.800000000001s)]
*  You just wouldn't know if that was happening. [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8503.6s)]
*  There's no way to know until that tumor [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8505.480000000001s)]
*  starts creating problems. [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8507.74s)]
*  Right, although that's another thing. [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8508.880000000001s)]
*  Cancer screening is so antiquated, right? [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8511.12s)]
*  We do such poor jobs of cancer screening [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8513.44s)]
*  with a colonoscopy, a PAP test, a mammogram. [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8515.92s)]
*  What's a better cancer screen? [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8519.320000000002s)]
*  There's a new technology that has been developed [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8520.92s)]
*  using fragments of DNA [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8522.88s)]
*  that are released into the bloodstream from cancers [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8528.16s)]
*  way before it ever shows up on a scan or an imaging, [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8531.88s)]
*  which you can pick up cancers a year or two or three [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8535.16s)]
*  before they ever show up on any kind of other tests. [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8537.28s)]
*  And it's called Galleri. [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8539.52s)]
*  It screens 50 of the most common cancers, [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8540.52s)]
*  many of which there's no screening test for. [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8543.84s)]
*  And the false positive rate, [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8546.12s)]
*  which is what you worry about, is very low, like half a percent. [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8549.32s)]
*  That means it shows you have a cancer when you actually don't, [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8552.64s)]
*  which can be very terrifying. [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8554.76s)]
*  It's about 75% accurate in finding the cancer early [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8556.72s)]
*  if you find it. [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8560.68s)]
*  And it's great. [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8561.92s)]
*  We've picked up so many people with issues. [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8563.16s)]
*  One in 188 of our members who've tested with this test [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8565.0s)]
*  have a cancer that they wouldn't have known about otherwise, [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8568.72s)]
*  and they can catch it in early stage before it kills you. [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8570.56s)]
*  The pushback on this early detection was surprising to me. [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8573.44s)]
*  Not this one in particular, but a few years ago, [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8576.08s)]
*  I paid for a Pronovo scan. [[02:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8578.72s)]
*  Then I started seeing some of the pushback on whole-body MRIs [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8580.679999999998s)]
*  from people in the standard medical community. [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8585.16s)]
*  So I asked my good friend, a neurosurgeon at UCSF, Eddie Chang, [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8587.039999999999s)]
*  I said, hey, what do you think of these whole-body scans? [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8591.519999999999s)]
*  And he said, I get people coming in all the time [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8593.119999999999s)]
*  who have identified brain tumors and aneurysms and issues [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8595.439999999999s)]
*  that they were completely unaware of [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8599.64s)]
*  that they would probably be dead in the next five to 10 years. [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8601.039999999999s)]
*  And by the way, I don't get paid by Pronovo. [[02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8603.48s)]
*  I don't have any deal with Pronovo [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8606.16s)]
*  or any other of these whole-body imaging things. [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8607.44s)]
*  And I realized there's a cost. [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8609.640000000001s)]
*  So I think the implication is from the people [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8610.880000000001s)]
*  that give pushback like, oh, these things are expensive, [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8613.52s)]
*  and we're going to kind of push back on them as a tool [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8616.28s)]
*  because we don't want people to feel badly [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8620.32s)]
*  if they can't get them. [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8622.44s)]
*  We don't want to make- [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8623.480000000001s)]
*  They're going to become commoditized. [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8624.560000000001s)]
*  They're going to become cheap. [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8625.84s)]
*  Just like we're able to get like 15,000 long-term tests [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8626.68s)]
*  for 499, we're going to be able to get [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8628.560000000001s)]
*  a whole-body scan for 300 bucks. [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8629.92s)]
*  It's happening. [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8631.68s)]
*  It's not, it doesn't have to be 3000 bucks. [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8632.52s)]
*  So that's coming. [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8634.16s)]
*  And I think we're going to lean into that [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8635.28s)]
*  function in the future, but it's really important [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8637.04s)]
*  to understand that you want data on your body [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8640.400000000001s)]
*  as much as you can have and as much as you can afford. [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8642.720000000001s)]
*  And the healthcare system should pay for it, [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8645.2s)]
*  and they don't because they don't understand [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8646.800000000001s)]
*  the value of this because they don't see the benefit [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8648.84s)]
*  as the people transfer insurance companies so regularly [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8651.960000000001s)]
*  and jobs so regularly that they figure, [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8654.6s)]
*  oh, if I invest in somebody's health, [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8656.640000000001s)]
*  then the next guy's going to get the benefit. [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8657.960000000001s)]
*  If I'm United, then Aetna will get the benefit, [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8659.560000000001s)]
*  or Sigma will get the benefit. [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8662.0s)]
*  I see. [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8663.160000000002s)]
*  It's kind of like a, it's a perverse incentive system, [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8664.08s)]
*  but I think data-driven healthcare is the future. [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8667.2s)]
*  Really, imagine a place where you can have [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8671.04s)]
*  all your personal health data, and this is where we're going, [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8673.6s)]
*  where you can have all your biomarker testing, [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8676.28s)]
*  where you can have all your wearable data, [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8678.8s)]
*  your full genome, your microbiome, all imaging data, [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8680.52s)]
*  not just the whole-body scan, but looking [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8684.12s)]
*  at your body composition, looking at AI heart scans [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8686.28s)]
*  that tell how much plaque you have and much more. [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8688.52s)]
*  With your medical history, with all the world's [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8692.24s)]
*  scientific literature informing it, [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8694.96s)]
*  with knowledge experts also overlaying their knowledge [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8696.84s)]
*  and expertise onto it, in a platform that allows you [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8700.199999999999s)]
*  to query it, so think about like an AI chatbot [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8704.08s)]
*  that's just based on you, like it's your data. [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8709.16s)]
*  And what now in medicine is so amazing is we try [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8712.4s)]
*  to make diagnoses and understand what's going on [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8714.8s)]
*  with people with such limited data sets. [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8717.36s)]
*  About them. [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8719.36s)]
*  About them, they're so antiquated. [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8720.199999999999s)]
*  You've got guys like Lee Hood, who's literally [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8722.6s)]
*  measuring thousands and thousands of data points [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8724.960000000001s)]
*  on patients, and he's using his project called [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8727.4s)]
*  the Phenome Project, I think it's called Phenome Health, [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8730.48s)]
*  where he's being able to say, oh geez, I can detect this [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8733.16s)]
*  from a few molecules in the blood, I can see what's going [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8735.960000000001s)]
*  on with your microbiome, or a few molecules in your blood, [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8738.24s)]
*  I can see if you're going to be at risk for Alzheimer's. [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8740.48s)]
*  And now we offer this for, you think there was no test [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8742.4s)]
*  for Alzheimer's, right, you had to do a brain biopsy, [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8745.12s)]
*  or you had to wait until you forgot your name of this [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8747.68s)]
*  or that of the other thing. [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8751.12s)]
*  And now we can through blood testing look for things [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8752.480000000001s)]
*  like p-tau 217 and amyloid 42-40, [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8754.720000000001s)]
*  maybe amyloid 42-40 ratios. [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8759.12s)]
*  What can you do in response to that? [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8761.28s)]
*  Let's say somebody is. [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8762.52s)]
*  That's a good question. [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8763.36s)]
*  That's a great question. [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8764.28s)]
*  I mean Alzheimer's is a tough one. [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8765.12s)]
*  I followed this field for a long time. [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8766.12s)]
*  I had people working in the bench right across from me [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8769.04s)]
*  as a post-doc, there have been so many hypotheses. [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8771.08s)]
*  Not just the plaques and tangles thing, [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8774.480000000001s)]
*  not just the beta amyloid hypothesis, [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8777.2s)]
*  but I'll tell you, my friends who are neurologists [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8779.08s)]
*  are not optimistic. [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8784.24s)]
*  They're not, but they're not looking at the problem [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8786.0s)]
*  the right way, right? [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8787.68s)]
*  It's sort of like the blind man and the elephant. [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8789.28s)]
*  They're looking at their one thing [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8791.12s)]
*  and they don't see an answer. [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8792.64s)]
*  But you guys, guys like Richard Isaacson, [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8794.12s)]
*  who was at Cornell and now he's in Florida, [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8795.76s)]
*  who if you haven't had on your podcast, you should, [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8798.28s)]
*  who's a neurologist studying Alzheimer's [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8801.4s)]
*  and looking at deep diagnostics and personalized approaches [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8803.7s)]
*  to address the root causes. [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8807.8s)]
*  And seeing remarkable outcome reversals. [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8809.88s)]
*  He had a special on, I think CNN with Sanjay Gupta [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8811.64s)]
*  where they literally showed that you can take [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8815.48s)]
*  these biomarkers and you find them early enough [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8817.88s)]
*  you can intervene. [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8820.0s)]
*  And again, I've done this with dozens of patients [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8821.0s)]
*  who had dementia who were able to stop and reverse it. [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8824.0s)]
*  I have more right. [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8826.2s)]
*  With diet? [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8827.04s)]
*  Not just diet, it's everything. [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8827.88s)]
*  So Alzheimer's is like, it's like saying, [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8828.88s)]
*  it's like just saying you can't remember stuff. [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8832.28s)]
*  Like, you know, we have all these fancy names [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8834.88s)]
*  we give to diseases and then we say, [[02:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8836.6s)]
*  oh, I know why you can't remember things. [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8838.6s)]
*  You have Alzheimer's. [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8840.0s)]
*  No, Alzheimer's is the name we give to people [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8840.84s)]
*  who can't remember things. [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8842.640000000001s)]
*  It's a certain specific type of problem. [[02:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8844.4s)]
*  It's a constellation issue. [[02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8846.36s)]
*  But then the question is what causes it? [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8847.2s)]
*  And there are multiple causes. [[02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8848.68s)]
*  It's called type two diabetes, [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8850.04s)]
*  type three diabetes of the brain [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8851.640000000001s)]
*  or it's caused by insulin resistance. [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8852.880000000001s)]
*  We know diabetics have four times the rate of Alzheimer's. [[02:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8854.640000000001s)]
*  It could be caused by environmental toxins [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8857.28s)]
*  like heavy metals. [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8858.92s)]
*  It could be caused by mold [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8859.76s)]
*  or it could be caused by Lyme disease [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8860.76s)]
*  like Chris Christopherson had, [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8862.52s)]
*  or it could be caused by change in the microbiome [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8864.12s)]
*  or by nutritional deficiencies. [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8866.2s)]
*  I had one woman who was like diagnosed [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8867.64s)]
*  with early dementia and she had, [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8869.08s)]
*  she was older, brilliant woman, [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8871.32s)]
*  but was starting to lose it. [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8873.76s)]
*  Turned out she had severe methylation issues [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8875.6s)]
*  and B vitamin deficiency and Foley deficiency [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8877.76s)]
*  and I treated her with a vitamin B12 shot [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8880.64s)]
*  and some B vitamins and she came right back. [[02:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8882.68s)]
*  So it's a multi, again, multi-causal, [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8885.039999999999s)]
*  multi-modal treatments. [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8889.0s)]
*  You gotta figure out all the causes [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8890.4s)]
*  and you gotta treat all the problems. [[02:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8892.4s)]
*  If someone has mercury issues and mold issues [[02:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8894.4s)]
*  and they have Lyme disease and they have gut issues [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8896.56s)]
*  and they have pre-diabetes and they have methylation issues, [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8898.279999999999s)]
*  you gotta treat all those things. [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8901.6s)]
*  And then you can see real change in people's biomarkers. [[02:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8903.6s)]
*  Ketogenic dyes have been affected, [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8906.32s)]
*  but it's not like a keto diet [[02:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8907.68s)]
*  will fix everybody with Alzheimer's [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8908.76s)]
*  or the chelation will fix everybody with Alzheimer's [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8910.4s)]
*  or that fixing their diabetes [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8912.199999999999s)]
*  will fix everybody with Alzheimer's. [[02:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8914.0s)]
*  You have to find all the things and treat all the things. [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8915.08s)]
*  Like if your roof has 30 holes in it [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8917.88s)]
*  and you plug 25 of them and it rains, [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8920.08s)]
*  it's still gonna get wet in your house. [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8922.08s)]
*  And that's the opposite of how medicine's practiced. [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8924.32s)]
*  And I ran into this at Cleveland Clinic [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8927.16s)]
*  and we were trying to study Alzheimer's [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8928.0s)]
*  and we had a guy who really wanted to look at the black box [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8928.84s)]
*  of functional medicine. [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8931.04s)]
*  People come in, you do personalized care. [[02:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8932.2s)]
*  Out the other side, what happens? [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8935.24s)]
*  And the head of science there was like, [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8937.2s)]
*  no, no, we can't do that. [[02:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8938.720000000001s)]
*  We can only study one thing at a time. [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8939.720000000001s)]
*  Vitamin D, we'll do that study. [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8941.68s)]
*  Then we'll do fish oil study. [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8943.04s)]
*  Then we'll do diet study. [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8944.16s)]
*  Then we'll do exercise study. [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8945.04s)]
*  Then we'll do whatever study. [[02:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8946.0s)]
*  I'm like, that's not how the body works. [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8947.08s)]
*  If you wanna grow a plant, [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8949.28s)]
*  you can't just say I'm just gonna give it water and soil, [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8950.24s)]
*  but no light or I'm gonna give it light but no soil. [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8953.36s)]
*  Or it just doesn't make sense. [[02:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8956.400000000001s)]
*  The whole context. [[02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8958.640000000001s)]
*  Functional medicine is really about understanding this model [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8959.480000000001s)]
*  and how do you apply it in a personalized way. [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8962.08s)]
*  And Richard Isaacs has done it. [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8963.68s)]
*  Dale Bredesen has done it. [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8964.76s)]
*  And their results are amazing. [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8966.2s)]
*  And I personally have seen this in my patients [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8967.720000000001s)]
*  where they either stop progressing or they reverse it. [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8970.32s)]
*  Now sometimes they do progress and it's hard, [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8974.6s)]
*  but I've had patients who've done incredible [[02:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8976.04s)]
*  for years and years and years. [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8977.84s)]
*  Well, about a year ago, [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8979.400000000001s)]
*  somebody who's probably one of the finest cardiologists [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8981.36s)]
*  in North America contacted me of all people and asked, [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8984.24s)]
*  what do I know about ketogenic diet [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8987.76s)]
*  for the treatment of Alzheimer's? [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8989.6s)]
*  And I said, I've known him since I was a kid [[02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8991.04s)]
*  because he's a family friend, a phenomenal cardiologist. [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8993.480000000001s)]
*  And I said, this is an odd moment [[02:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8996.560000000001s)]
*  because I remember years ago, [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=8999.28s)]
*  I said I was gonna go into neuroscience. [[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9000.44s)]
*  And he said, why would you go into neuroscience? [[02:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9002.2s)]
*  Like there's nothing that, [[02:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9004.28s)]
*  like neuroscience is a ridiculous field. [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9005.36s)]
*  Why would you do that? [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9007.08s)]
*  I think he- [[02:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9008.36s)]
*  The joke about neurologists is you diagnose [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9009.2s)]
*  and adios, like there's nothing to do. [[02:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9011.720000000001s)]
*  You could do diagnosing problem, [[02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9012.560000000001s)]
*  but you can't do anything about it. [[02:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9013.84s)]
*  So exactly to that point. [[02:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9014.76s)]
*  So, but he was very curious because his father had Alzheimer's [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9016.400000000001s)]
*  and he was exploring the ketogenic diet [[02:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9020.400000000001s)]
*  for the treatment of Alzheimer's for his dad. [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9023.400000000001s)]
*  And he was observing some really impressive results. [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9025.36s)]
*  So here's a cardiologist, a moment the best, [[02:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9027.880000000001s)]
*  asking me what I've seen about this. [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9031.160000000002s)]
*  And I said, well, I know Dale Bredesen's work [[02:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9032.76s)]
*  and I'm learning as I go. [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9034.44s)]
*  And we will cover this on the podcast. [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9037.400000000001s)]
*  This is very informative. [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9039.12s)]
*  I wanna make sure that we hit the other [[02:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9041.92s)]
*  kind of cutting edge things. [[02:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9043.800000000001s)]
*  I'm curious if you take anything to augment NAD. [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9045.6s)]
*  I take sublingual NMN every day. [[02:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9049.640000000001s)]
*  I don't get paid by a company that makes NMN. [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9051.76s)]
*  I take it, the most noticeable effects [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9054.04s)]
*  that I've observed are increased energy. [[02:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9056.6s)]
*  My hair grows super fast when I take NAD [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9058.52s)]
*  and my nails grow super fast. [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9061.08s)]
*  Those are not effects I was trying to achieve, [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9062.28s)]
*  but that's what I've observed. [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9064.6s)]
*  Do you take NMN, NR or do you do NAD infusions? [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9066.64s)]
*  Yeah, I do. [[02:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9070.96s)]
*  And why? [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9071.8s)]
*  I think when you look at the data [[02:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9072.64s)]
*  and I wrote a book called Young Forever [[02:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9073.8s)]
*  and talk about longevity and the pathways. [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9075.72s)]
*  And when you look at the fundamental regulatory systems [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9077.76s)]
*  in the body around cellular repair, [[02:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9080.72s)]
*  healing, renewal, regeneration, [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9083.199999999999s)]
*  we have a built-in healing system. [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9085.88s)]
*  Like everybody understands that. [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9087.48s)]
*  If you cut your skin, you don't go, [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9088.519999999999s)]
*  oh, would you please heal and please recruit these [[02:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9090.76s)]
*  stem cells and read this angiogenesis factors [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9093.48s)]
*  and bring cytokines over here to do that. [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9095.96s)]
*  Your body knows what to do. [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9097.759999999998s)]
*  So you break a bone. [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9099.039999999999s)]
*  It's got its own healing system. [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9100.0s)]
*  So in the body, there's, I call these longevity switches. [[02:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9102.08s)]
*  But they regulate not just longevity, [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9105.88s)]
*  but they regulate chronic disease and much more. [[02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9107.8s)]
*  And they're embedded ancient pathways [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9110.359999999999s)]
*  that exist from worms to humans. [[02:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9112.24s)]
*  mTOR, MPK, sirtuins and insulin signaling pathways. [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9114.839999999998s)]
*  And NAD in the body works to activate [[02:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9118.599999999999s)]
*  one of those longevity switches called sirtuins, [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9123.720000000001s)]
*  which are involved in DNA repair. [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9126.04s)]
*  So when you get a hundred thousand hits a day to your DNA [[02:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9128.960000000001s)]
*  as it's unraveling and re-raveling [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9131.52s)]
*  and it kind of gets damaged, [[02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9133.24s)]
*  you need an army to go out and like fix it, right? [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9135.28s)]
*  A bunch of carpenter's kind of like repair that broken DNA. [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9137.68s)]
*  NAD stimulates that. [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9140.640000000001s)]
*  It also stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis, [[02:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9142.08s)]
*  forming new mitochondria, improves mitochondrial function, [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9144.36s)]
*  improves insulin sensitivity, improves mTOR, [[02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9147.56s)]
*  auto-induced autophagy. [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9152.48s)]
*  So there are a lot of redundancies in these pathways, [[02:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9154.16s)]
*  but it's really quite amazing [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9156.48s)]
*  when you see how the body is organized. [[02:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9158.279999999999s)]
*  And so NAD is one of the things [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9159.8s)]
*  that's not gonna make you live forever or cure every disease, [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9161.4s)]
*  but it's an optimization tool, [[02:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9164.24s)]
*  because as you get older, NAD levels decline. [[02:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9166.119999999999s)]
*  And so your mitochondria decline, your energy declines, [[02:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9168.96s)]
*  and it's great for all of that. [[02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9172.08s)]
*  So I take it and I think- [[02:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9173.64s)]
*  How do you get NAD into this? [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9175.4s)]
*  I get a thousand milligrams of NMN. [[02:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9176.519999999999s)]
*  Okay, so you take that daily? [[02:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9179.519999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9180.92s)]
*  Okay, yeah, I do the sublingual NMN, [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9181.76s)]
*  and occasionally I'll get an NAD infusion, [[02:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9183.24s)]
*  but it's so unpleasant as it goes in. [[02:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9185.64s)]
*  It's like you're getting stomped on by an elephant. [[02:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9188.16s)]
*  That's true. [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9189.84s)]
*  Slowly, slowly, but you do feel great afterwards. [[02:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9190.68s)]
*  Exosomes, have you had them? [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9196.2s)]
*  I've had them, I've given them. [[02:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9198.52s)]
*  What are they, and why would you get them? [[02:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9199.84s)]
*  So again, the body has this amazing healing system, [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9201.64s)]
*  and it's part of the body's healing system. [[02:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9205.48s)]
*  And this whole field you're talking about, [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9207.52s)]
*  whether it's peptides, whether it's exosomes, [[02:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9208.76s)]
*  there's NMN, it's part of this field of regenerative medicine. [[02:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9211.48s)]
*  How do we regenerate and heal and repair [[02:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9213.68s)]
*  by activating our body's own built-in systems, [[02:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9216.6s)]
*  which are way better and way stronger [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9219.24s)]
*  and work way faster than most medications, [[02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9221.6s)]
*  if you know how to use them. [[02:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9224.24s)]
*  So exosomes are essentially the little packets [[02:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9225.48s)]
*  of healing information that are inside stem cells. [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9228.04s)]
*  And there's thousands of them. [[02:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9231.76s)]
*  And they get released, think of like little, [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9233.880000000001s)]
*  when you blow bubbles when you're a kid, [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9237.960000000001s)]
*  it's like these little bubbles of stuff [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9239.320000000002s)]
*  that go out into the body, [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9240.720000000001s)]
*  and then they go to where they're needed, [[02:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9241.960000000001s)]
*  and then they release the packets of information [[02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9243.12s)]
*  that contain growth factors, healing factors, [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9244.880000000001s)]
*  anti-inflammatory factors, tissue repair factors. [[02:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9246.720000000001s)]
*  And that's how the body tends to repair and heal. [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9250.04s)]
*  And so I remember once I had COVID really bad, [[02:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9252.800000000001s)]
*  and afterwards I've never really felt depressed. [[02:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9256.84s)]
*  I may have been sad, obviously, my life, [[02:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9260.320000000002s)]
*  and lost parents and had things happen. [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9261.640000000001s)]
*  There were life issues. [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9263.320000000002s)]
*  But I felt physiologically depressed. [[02:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9265.64s)]
*  Like my brain felt terrible, I couldn't think. [[02:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9267.519999999999s)]
*  That's how I felt with COVID too. [[02:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9269.84s)]
*  Yeah, cognitive issues. [[02:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9271.16s)]
*  I was like, I'm an idiot, and I'm depressed, [[02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9272.599999999999s)]
*  and I wanna kill myself. [[02:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9274.599999999999s)]
*  And my higher self is like, this is not me. [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9275.8s)]
*  And I took a load of exosomes, IV, I just got them, [[02:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9280.68s)]
*  because I'm a doctor, I can get them, [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9284.96s)]
*  and I gave them to myself. [[02:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9286.039999999999s)]
*  And literally within hours, I was resurrected. [[02:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9287.64s)]
*  It was amazing, yeah. [[02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9290.439999999999s)]
*  And I've used it for my knee. [[02:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9292.32s)]
*  I have a meniscus injury, I've used them in my knee. [[02:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9293.599999999999s)]
*  I've used them in my back. [[02:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9295.56s)]
*  So I think they can be very effective. [[02:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9297.16s)]
*  I use them intravenously for- [[02:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9298.68s)]
*  Is it done in the United States? [[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9300.439999999999s)]
*  You can, you can give exosomes to the United States. [[02:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9301.96s)]
*  So it's FDA approved? [[02:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9303.8s)]
*  Yeah, but they're approved for skin issues, [[02:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9304.64s)]
*  or this thing, so there's like an off-label uses [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9308.039999999999s)]
*  with what they use them for. [[02:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9310.119999999999s)]
*  A lot of things like stem cells, [[02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9311.96s)]
*  you have to go out of the country to do it, [[02:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9313.359999999999s)]
*  and there's a regulatory issues or safety issues. [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9315.0s)]
*  I'm still scared to do some stuff. [[02:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9317.56s)]
*  I understand, I mean, you wanna not play with this stuff, [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9318.88s)]
*  but you also can, they can be used effectively, [[02:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9322.119999999999s)]
*  my wife, for example, was a runner, [[02:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9325.56s)]
*  and she kinda tore her knees up [[02:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9327.52s)]
*  and had patellofemoral syndrome and couldn't walk. [[02:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9329.44s)]
*  And I mean, she's younger than I am, [[02:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9331.84s)]
*  and she shouldn't be feeling that, [[02:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9333.4s)]
*  like she's 80 years old and her knees. [[02:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9334.72s)]
*  We went to Costa Rica to a very reputable center, [[02:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9336.36s)]
*  and I knew the founders of it. [[02:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9339.84s)]
*  I inspected the laboratory, I went with the scientists [[02:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9342.0s)]
*  who harvested them, who grew them, what they did, [[02:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9344.0s)]
*  their testing practice, I did my homework. [[02:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9347.16s)]
*  And she ended up having no knee problems [[02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9349.76s)]
*  after she got her stem cells in her knees. [[02:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9352.52s)]
*  I was like, that's amazing. [[02:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9353.96s)]
*  And this is like, probably it's closer to two years later. [[02:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9355.84s)]
*  That's awesome. [[02:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9358.12s)]
*  I mean, I've heard great things from many people. [[02:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9358.96s)]
*  I haven't felt a need to do stem cells, [[02:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9361.12s)]
*  so that's why I haven't done it, [[02:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9363.28s)]
*  but I'm curious about exosomes [[02:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9364.28s)]
*  and been cautiously exploring the peptide space. [[02:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9365.68s)]
*  We talked about some other supplements. [[02:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9369.08s)]
*  Look, Mark, we've covered a ton. [[02:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9370.88s)]
*  It was a whirlwind, and at the same- [[02:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9374.48s)]
*  I have ADD, I'm like, what are we talking about? [[02:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9377.04s)]
*  No, no, at the same time, I mean, [[02:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9378.56s)]
*  we talked about food as medicine. [[02:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9380.32s)]
*  Talked about core supplements that people really should, [[02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9383.2s)]
*  perhaps not even think about as supplements anymore, [[02:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9386.4s)]
*  but that's sort of up to the, [[02:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9388.48s)]
*  that's in the ear of the beholder. [[02:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9390.72s)]
*  My joke on that is this. [[02:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9392.119999999999s)]
*  I said, people say, do you need supplements? [[02:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9393.08s)]
*  I'm like, no, you don't need supplements, [[02:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9394.64s)]
*  but only in certain conditions. [[02:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9395.64s)]
*  You drink pure, clean water, you breathe pure, clean air, [[02:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9397.56s)]
*  you wake up with the sun, you go to bed with the sun, [[02:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9400.96s)]
*  you have no chronic stress, [[02:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9402.84s)]
*  you're exposed to no environmental toxins, [[02:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9403.84s)]
*  and you're only hunting and gathering your own wild food. [[02:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9405.76s)]
*  If that's you, you don't need any supplements. [[02:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9407.76s)]
*  And it's the 1930s, right. [[02:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9410.039999999999s)]
*  So yeah, things like D3, omegas, I like that answer. [[02:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9412.24s)]
*  Magnesium, selenium, iodine, a case, [[02:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9415.36s)]
*  you made a case for table salt [[02:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9418.4s)]
*  in addition to all the fancy salts that we all enjoy. [[02:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9419.68s)]
*  Or just having seaweed and fish, you know. [[02:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9421.92s)]
*  Seaweed and fish, but not tuna. [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9423.6s)]
*  And thank you for touching on air [[02:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9425.56s)]
*  and lack of cleanliness in air, heavy metal poisoning, [[02:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9429.4s)]
*  things to be cautious about there as ways to detox [[02:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9434.56s)]
*  and for illustrating that detoxification is possible [[02:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9437.199999999999s)]
*  through known pathways that anti-aging, longevity, [[02:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9441.08s)]
*  whatever you want to call it, [[02:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9444.96s)]
*  and bodily repair pathways are inherent in us, [[02:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9446.16s)]
*  and so we can encourage them. [[02:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9448.6s)]
*  And I also really want to thank you [[02:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9451.44s)]
*  for being willing to wade into the swamp [[02:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9453.96s)]
*  that is the public health debate right now, [[02:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9457.56s)]
*  but especially the corner of the swamp that is, [[02:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9460.52s)]
*  for lack of a better way to put it, [[02:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9464.36s)]
*  the big food FDA relationship [[02:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9466.0s)]
*  and what you and Bobby Kennedy and others, [[02:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9468.24s)]
*  I hope they will recruit from the left. [[02:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9471.72s)]
*  I know Cory Booker's been actively involved in this. [[02:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9473.84s)]
*  He's on the left, clearly, [[02:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9476.08s)]
*  and trying to clean up the food supply, give people options. [[02:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9479.16s)]
*  What I heard is that it's not about forcing things, [[02:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9482.8s)]
*  but it's about giving people options and knowledge. [[02:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9485.92s)]
*  Transparency, education. [[02:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9488.28s)]
*  So, like, I really appreciate you [[02:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9489.68s)]
*  and the entire population of people [[02:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9492.88s)]
*  that care about their health, [[02:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9495.56s)]
*  whether they realize it or not, [[02:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9496.68s)]
*  they appreciate you, [[02:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9498.64s)]
*  because you're a real pioneer in this field, [[02:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9499.48s)]
*  and you've trudged some really challenging waters, [[02:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9500.56s)]
*  and I happen to know, [[02:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9503.039999999999s)]
*  and I feel very good saying that it is [[02:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9504.48s)]
*  your inherent good nature, [[02:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9506.599999999999s)]
*  I think that's allowed you to go through one swamp [[02:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9508.8s)]
*  after another after the other, [[02:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9511.8s)]
*  with your optimism and your kindness of spirit intact. [[02:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9513.119999999999s)]
*  So, thanks, you're a real role model [[02:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9517.119999999999s)]
*  to everyone who cares about their health [[02:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9518.919999999998s)]
*  and who's trying to help others care about their health. [[02:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9520.32s)]
*  Yeah, I'm a pathological optimist. [[02:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9522.32s)]
*  But the good news is optimists live longer, [[02:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9524.439999999999s)]
*  even if they're wrong. [[02:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9526.08s)]
*  I was thinking about this the other day, [[02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9527.48s)]
*  I met your new dog. [[02:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9528.4s)]
*  Oh yeah, Lenny. [[02:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9529.84s)]
*  Forgive me for saying this, [[02:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9530.68s)]
*  but Lenny's got a great attitude. [[02:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9531.52s)]
*  You know what my first thought was? [[02:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9533.12s)]
*  It's kind of like Mark. [[02:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9534.56s)]
*  He like, came in, he crawled up on my lap, [[02:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9535.76s)]
*  although you didn't crawl up on my lap. [[02:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9537.92s)]
*  I just want to make the point [[02:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9539.52s)]
*  that he has no stranger danger. [[02:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9540.48s)]
*  He was very, but he's a really wonderful [[02:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9542.52s)]
*  and beautiful dog, by the way. [[02:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9545.24s)]
*  He's an impressive dog. [[02:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9546.36s)]
*  And you just have that good nature about you, [[02:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9548.68s)]
*  and I know you want the best for people. [[02:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9551.72s)]
*  I just don't like people suffering [[02:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9553.64s)]
*  when they don't need to. [[02:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9554.88s)]
*  I feel like I'm having a glass of water. [[02:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9556.080000000002s)]
*  They're thirsty, and there's a giant glass wall between us. [[02:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9558.04s)]
*  And that's why I've been working my whole life [[02:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9561.36s)]
*  to kind of get the message out about how people can heal, [[02:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9562.76s)]
*  whether it's on their own or whether through my books [[02:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9564.880000000001s)]
*  or through a free education, my podcasts, your stuff. [[02:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9566.960000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's a public service [[02:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9569.84s)]
*  because people are suffering and they don't need to. [[02:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9571.84s)]
*  I feel that. [[02:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9576.400000000001s)]
*  I know everyone listening feels that. [[02:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9577.2s)]
*  And thank you for everything that you've done. [[02:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9578.720000000001s)]

*  It's my very first book. [[02:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9634.96s)]
*  It's entitled Protocols, [[02:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9636.56s)]
*  an Operating Manual for the Human Body. [[02:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9638.0s)]
*  This is a book that I've been working on [[02:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9640.119999999999s)]
*  for more than five years, [[02:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9641.32s)]
*  and that's based on more than 30 years [[02:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9642.48s)]
*  of research and experience. [[02:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9644.8s)]
*  And it covers protocols for everything from sleep [[02:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9646.36s)]
*  to exercise to stress control, [[02:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9649.4s)]
*  protocols related to focus and motivation. [[02:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9651.88s)]
*  And of course, I provide the scientific substantiation [[02:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9654.36s)]
*  for the protocols that are included. [[02:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9657.72s)]

*  Again, the book is called Protocols, [[02:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyneMnERmnI&t=9667.84s)]
