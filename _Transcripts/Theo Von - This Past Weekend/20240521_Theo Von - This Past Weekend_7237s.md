*  Get all your tickets at theovon.com. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=41.0s)]
*  Thank you so much for your support. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=46.0s)]
*  Today's guest is a comedian. He's a podcaster. He's the co-host of Matt and Shane's Secret Podcast. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=50.0s)]
*  He has a special that just premiered last year called The Speed of Light. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=59.0s)]
*  He's touring now everywhere. I'm grateful to get to spend time with him. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=64.0s)]
*  Today's guest is Matt McCusker. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=69.0s)]
*  Hello. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=80.0s)]
*  Well, what have you been watching? NBA Finals or War in Gaza? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=100.0s)]
*  War in Gaza, honestly. I haven't caught a lot of the finals. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=110.0s)]
*  I'm being bombarded with the footage of the war. Opinions about it. People have a different take. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=114.0s)]
*  Yeah, people have a lot of different takes over there. I don't even know what inning it is in. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=121.0s)]
*  I think it's in overtime. I think they've been going for a while. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=126.0s)]
*  Yeah, it seems like it's kind of... Yeah, you feel like a referee would step in. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=130.0s)]
*  Yeah, you think. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=137.0s)]
*  And mitigate it because it feels like it's like a ten run rule genocide over there. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=139.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's like the popular opinion that they're being totally genocide. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=143.0s)]
*  They throw out the kids and you're like, damn, that's terrible. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=148.0s)]
*  Then you get people going, hey, why can't Israel defend itself? And you go, all right, that's a fair point too. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=151.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, no, that's definitely a fair point. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=157.0s)]
*  Yeah, I have no idea, man. I think it's awful. I hear a lot of people talk about it with certainty. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=159.0s)]
*  And I'm like, yeah, sure. Anytime I watch a video about pro-Palestine, I'm like, okay, I see that. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=165.0s)]
*  And we had RFK on our podcast yesterday and he was like, actually, Israel rules. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=170.0s)]
*  And we're like, okay, those are good points too. But it's very bad from what I understand. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=174.0s)]
*  I think the U.S. sees really bad and I hope they can figure it out, but it looks like a lot more people are going to have to die and then they're going to maybe figure it out. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=179.0s)]
*  Because the U.S. could shut it down, couldn't they? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=187.0s)]
*  It seems like we could. Yeah, it seems like we could jump in and shut it down, you know? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=189.0s)]
*  But we fund Israel. I just don't like that Netanyahu. I don't trust that Netanyahu guy. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=194.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's a shady character. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=200.0s)]
*  That guy seems like a control pervert or something. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=202.0s)]
*  Yeah, he seems like, for real, a bad guy. He seems like a real deal bad guy. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=206.0s)]
*  Even if you just look at him like, oh, that's the bad guy. If you asked a four-year-old, right, like, who's the bad guy here? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=210.0s)]
*  They would immediately pick out that dude. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=216.0s)]
*  Also, whenever someone's been the president for like 27 years, that's usually the case where it's like, oh, all right. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=219.0s)]
*  The U.S. should go to war with both of them. We should start bombing Israel and Palestine until they both stop. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=224.0s)]
*  Maybe. I don't know. I'm spitballing. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=230.0s)]
*  I think I've always thought we should give Mississippi to Palestine. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=233.0s)]
*  That's not bad. One of them is going to get Mississippi. Loser gets Mississippi. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=238.0s)]
*  Or, you know what I'm saying, give Palestine a place here, you know? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=242.0s)]
*  That'd be cool. I'd be down with that. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=245.0s)]
*  Because then at least the people would have a place to be, you know, where they could, like, not be in competition, I guess, with their neighbors and live at peace, you know? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=247.0s)]
*  But yeah, I don't know a ton about it. I just feel like a certain way, you know? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=257.0s)]
*  Yeah. I watch Norman Finkelstein and I'm like, holy shit, this guy. And I'm like, he's Jewish, so he's got the inside track. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=263.0s)]
*  And then I watch people talk about him like he's a piece of shit. It's a bad thing. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=269.0s)]
*  The student protests are crazy, too. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=274.0s)]
*  Then you have peace demonstrations that fight each other over the issue. And it's like, it's kind of larping. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=276.0s)]
*  Like when the college kids start, like, moshing. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=282.0s)]
*  It's the new Renaissance Fair, kind of. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=284.0s)]
*  I mean, I hate, you know, I don't mean, and I don't mean, like, belittle like that. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=286.0s)]
*  But then it's like, and then the craziest part was at Ole Miss, they started yelling USA. It's like. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=290.0s)]
*  Really? Yeah. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=297.0s)]
*  Which side was yelling USA? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=299.0s)]
*  Oh, the frat boys. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=300.0s)]
*  The frat boys, yeah. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=301.0s)]
*  Came in and they were American. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=302.0s)]
*  They were just like, don't bring any of this shit around here. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=303.0s)]
*  They're kind of playing risk in real life. They were American. They came in like, yeah, dude, fuck, don't touch the flag. America rules. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=305.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, I think when people start taking down the flag, I guess that makes total sense, too, you know? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=311.0s)]
*  Yeah, you know, you can fight about anything, really, you know? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=315.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=318.0s)]
*  That's one thing. To go to like a news story and just be like, all right, I'm this team. I'm going to fight these guys. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=319.0s)]
*  I think sometimes you think, oh, maybe we're past war, but maybe that's just a side effect of living in America and not realizing that a lot of people still live in like a lot of conflict, you know? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=323.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, it does. It seems more and more ridiculous. It seems like back in the day, it was normal, you know, at least back then. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=334.0s)]
*  Like slavery was a worldwide institution that everyone was like, yeah, this is just how it is. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=340.0s)]
*  And I wonder if war is going to become that in like 50 years where it's like, dude, you guys are going to war. It's like, oh, that's shitty. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=344.0s)]
*  It's like, we didn't know. Because it is, it's insane. But it's like if someone attacks you, you have to attack them back to stop them from attacking you. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=350.0s)]
*  So it's one of those things, it's hard. It's hard to stop. It'd be nice, but it does seem more and more ridiculous, especially when you have like the politicians who are like, we got to love everyone. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=357.0s)]
*  We need to like include, marginalize, and they're like, go bomb the fuck out of those guys. You're like, all right, that's for sure. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=366.0s)]
*  That's a weird change of pace. But yeah. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=373.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's it. Yeah. You start to realize like, oh, this it's all a bunch of bullshit kind of like it's all like, yeah, I don't even know what I'm trying. It's like, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=375.0s)]
*  No, it's absurd. I think war is becoming absurd now because it's just kind of like, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=386.0s)]
*  Well, you can see why it's happening. I feel like it used to be this mirage, like we're fighting for the country and stuff. And now it's like, well, now people are like, what do you mean? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=391.0s)]
*  You don't even care about our country. Like our government's just letting millions of people in. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=399.0s)]
*  Eric Adams just said that they should let illegal immigrants, this is the fucking most insane thing I've ever heard. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=404.0s)]
*  He said they should let illegal immigrants be lifeguards at pools, which is a job that is apparently in high demand because we don't have enough people doing the job. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=412.0s)]
*  That's I mean, dude, I had a community pool in Philly that we would get shut down because there were no lifeguards and used to drive me crazy. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=428.0s)]
*  Oh, so it's a real thing. There are there is a weirdly there's a lack of lifeguards in like, at least in Philadelphia. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=434.0s)]
*  There were it was hard. They're hard to come across. I mean, it's pretty funny. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=440.0s)]
*  But he said because they're excellent swimmers that states those jobs that we are in high demand. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=443.0s)]
*  We could expedite. How do we have a large body of people that are in our city and country that are excellent swimmers? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=450.0s)]
*  And at the same time, we need lifeguards. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=462.0s)]
*  And the only obstacle is that we don't give them the right to work to become a lifeguard. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=465.0s)]
*  That's what you say. And illegal aliens are great swimmers. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=472.0s)]
*  That's kind of like a setup for a pretty easy joke about, you know, Mexican dudes. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=475.0s)]
*  Well, not Mexican. They didn't like there's not even it's all desert. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=481.0s)]
*  I mean, I could see maybe Cubans. I could see Puerto Ricans, maybe Nova Scotians or somebody that have to swim here. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=485.0s)]
*  But well, that's the joke. Isn't that the joke, though? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=494.0s)]
*  Mexican dudes say they swam here across some river. But I mean, I would say I don't did that. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=497.0s)]
*  I think so. But it could be. I could be wrong. I could be. I could be. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=503.0s)]
*  Oh, the Rio Grande. Yeah. I think that's like the final like in the Oregon Trail when you have to do that final river. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=507.0s)]
*  Hmm. Yeah, I think that's the final thing they got to do. Well, that's not that's like knee deep. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=513.0s)]
*  But oh, wow. Yeah, maybe that is the final thing. There's some of them congratulating their friends. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=518.0s)]
*  Yeah, they got it. They got to put out like an inner city Baywatch as like lifeguard propaganda to get people stoked on lifeguarding again. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=524.0s)]
*  Dude, yeah. Why don't we have a Mexican Baywatch and big, breasty lifeguard? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=530.0s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. That was when lifeguarding was cool. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=538.0s)]
*  Now, like nobody wants to be a lifeguard because it's kind of like, you know, it's not as cool as it was. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=541.0s)]
*  Yeah. And Pam Anderson, they could have just like a bunch of band-aids floating in the pool. It'd be funny. It'd be tight. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=545.0s)]
*  Dude, I would go run across the border every day and start drowning. Get some CPR. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=550.0s)]
*  True. They got to they got to fire something up because it does suck when you want to go to a pool in your neighborhood and they're like, oh, we're closed. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=560.0s)]
*  And you're like, why? And like, we don't have lifeguards. You're like, dude, you fucking serious. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=566.0s)]
*  But how do you have a lifeguard? Usually they would let a 15 year old or 16 year old kid who is taller than some of the other kids. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=569.0s)]
*  And he took a CPR class. Yeah. Right. Or learned it online. They would let him be the lifeguard. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=576.0s)]
*  How was that? When did that stop? I don't know. I think it still is kids. I think they just don't want to work. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=583.0s)]
*  I guess I don't know what it is because it's easy. It's a cake job, dude. You're just sitting there on the high chair. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=588.0s)]
*  Is your lifeguard? No, I've just I've watched them. I've been watching them for a long time, but it's like it seems easy. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=592.0s)]
*  You just chose in a pool. It's easy. The ocean is real. Yeah. Pool. It's like, dude, just keep an eye. Make sure nobody drowns. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=599.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Pool. That guy wasn't watching kids. A lot of times it seemed like he was just trying to smash like any chicks or moms or whatever. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=605.0s)]
*  Like there'd be four drowning kids and he'd be over there fucking just doing chest compressions on a divorce. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=612.0s)]
*  That's the perks of the job. That's crazy. Kids don't want to do that. It's probably like 15 bucks an hour hooking up with moms. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=621.0s)]
*  Sunshine. And it's the best. Your body is probably the healthiest you're going to be. Yeah. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=628.0s)]
*  You still have exosomes. You still have like cord blood in your system or whatever. Yeah, man. You got the young. Yeah, like the platelets and all that stuff. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=633.0s)]
*  Yeah. And you can also do that thing where everyone has public pools. You'll have everyone has to get out for some reason. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=643.0s)]
*  They'll be like on like every hour, like everyone out of the pool. Yeah. For no reason. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=647.0s)]
*  It's back in. So you could like start letting a couple ladies like you guys stay. You guys out. Yeah. Like a water bouncer kind of. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=651.0s)]
*  Hot chicks in first. You know, at that age you were so primed you could just point at your dick and it would ejaculate. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=657.0s)]
*  You know, when you were like 15. Yeah, you're doing like they're like at least the ones on the beach. They do like insane conditioning too. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=664.0s)]
*  Yeah. So yeah, man, they could you could be your jacked, your ripped. I think kids just aren't jacked that they're not as jacked anymore. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=670.0s)]
*  So they're probably ashamed of their bodies. Yeah, they're pale and kind of like, you know, not as ripped as they were before. You think so? Yeah. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=676.0s)]
*  Kids are not ripped like they were. They all wear fucking shirts now. Every little kid at the beach wears a fucking sun protective shirt. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=683.0s)]
*  It's like, let me see your pecs. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=689.0s)]
*  Trying to see how they're built. I want to make sure. I'm at the beach. There's a picture of a kid I met years ago and we kept in touch over letter. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=695.0s)]
*  We've been pen pals for years. Yeah. What was he wearing? Oh, he wasn't wearing much. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=704.0s)]
*  He wasn't wearing much. He's kind of a thicker kid. I think is one of his parents had passed away. Oh, yeah. You find it. Bring it. There we go. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=709.0s)]
*  And that kid was like nine. One of those big kids. Big nine year. That's good, though. That's that's his cocoon. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=720.0s)]
*  He's about to totally morph. Who's the dude? That's me, buddy. What? Yeah. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=725.0s)]
*  Yeah. Bro, when was this? That's back when you could wear what you wanted before the government said everything. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=730.0s)]
*  When was? You look great, man. Thanks, dude. That's what I'm saying. Like that kid should be more ripped than you just by laws of nature. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=737.0s)]
*  I mean, again, I'm not shaming him, obviously. I was a fat young kid, too. So that kid ripped into some cookies, dude. That dude was a fucking snack daddy. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=743.0s)]
*  He was a little fucking snack serpent. Were you fat when you were younger? No, I was fat. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=752.0s)]
*  I remember there was like one fall or something. Everybody in our town got fat or something. I think something bad happened. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=758.0s)]
*  And then everybody got fat. And then like in the spring, everybody like kind of thinned out. Yeah. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=763.0s)]
*  Seventh grade is like peak fat. Seventh grade for kids, you get really fat and puberty kind of like shoots you up. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=769.0s)]
*  Yeah. Did you did you go through a thicker time in your life? Yeah, I was pretty chubby. I wanted to play football and I stopped growing. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=775.0s)]
*  So I was like, I'm just going to get huge. So I did like the gallon of milk a day thing and like eighth grade going into ninth. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=781.0s)]
*  And I just got fat as though I was like super fat. I got fat and I got cut from the football team. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=786.0s)]
*  Yeah, you're just drinking a gallon of milk a day. You're a newborn. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=791.0s)]
*  That's they used to say that you drink a gallon of milk a day. You just put on tons of mass. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=796.0s)]
*  And you know the Cozy Shack rice puddings? They're these big tubs of rice pudding. I would crush one of those every day. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=801.0s)]
*  Bring up a couple of rice pudding. Dude, Cozy Shack. That was my shit. I used to crush them in class. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=807.0s)]
*  I got really big. I just wasn't tall enough. I played D end and then I stopped growing. I'm five ten. Yeah, those things man. God damn it, man. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=812.0s)]
*  Were they good? Yeah, they're so good. You guys ever eat Cozy Shack? It's good, man. I used to crush a tub. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=818.0s)]
*  It was like nine servings and I would sit there in class and put it down. They called me Fat Matt. I had a serious fat period. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=824.0s)]
*  Really? But I did own it. I really owned it. My screen name, my AOL screen name was Fat Matt. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=830.0s)]
*  Then I got kicked off of AOL because I had written something. It was like a rap lyric about gun violence in a chat room. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=835.0s)]
*  It was just like a Beastie Boys song. And then Columbine happened the next day. So someone reported my day before post as like Goat and Columbine. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=842.0s)]
*  I didn't do that. So I got kicked off AOL. I got reported. My parents kicked me off AOL. And then I came back. I got kicked off like a year. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=849.0s)]
*  At least I think my parents restricted me for that long. My new screen name, Fat Matt Strikes Back. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=856.0s)]
*  That was it? Oh yeah, like the Jedi or whatever. Return of the Fed-eye. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=861.0s)]
*  See, I got kicked off of AOL, man. It sucked. That was the shit. After school, just putting up your chats. There's the girls in your class. You'd be like, yo, what's up? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=866.0s)]
*  Did you do that? You didn't do the AOL chat? The instant messenger? [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=874.0s)]
*  No, I don't know what I did. I used to just went home and felt bad about myself for a couple hours. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=879.0s)]
*  But yeah, I would have probably rather do it online to other people. But then we started this podcast. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=884.0s)]
*  Well, you could go back then. You would do an instant messenger when it was time for dinner. You put like an away message. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=890.0s)]
*  You'd be like, you come up with something cool like, yo, I'm not here right now. I'll be back. Yeah, at the mall. Yeah. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=896.0s)]
*  Did you crush them all too when you were younger? Have to go to work. Dude, we used to go camp outside of the mall because it was about maybe the mall was probably 17 miles away. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=901.0s)]
*  It was kind of near this Pizza Hut and we would go camp out there. So we'd go on Saturday, bring a tent, camp out and go back in Sunday morning and just do everything that they that they had in there. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=909.0s)]
*  They had they had all types of shops for a while. They had a what was that one that had all the like stuff for like kids kind of like or like weird shit. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=922.0s)]
*  It would have like a lava lamp and then like Spencer's pride flag. Yeah, Spencer's. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=934.0s)]
*  And you can get like a dildo. They just sold like dildos and lava lamps and like attitude posters and shit. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=940.0s)]
*  It was like you can do it. You know, and then to be a dildo. Like that doesn't even have like gag gifts. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=946.0s)]
*  You can get like the small pecker condom, which is like a teeny tiny condom and like handed to someone. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=953.0s)]
*  They'd be like, oh, dude, what the fuck? Yeah. Why'd you do this to me? [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=957.0s)]
*  It was the worst. Yeah. Or you could get like a condom that had like pepper on it. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=960.0s)]
*  This shit that was like, you know, and you'd see somebody cutting one up in like a bowl of chili or like nobody knew how you used some of the products there. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=966.0s)]
*  Yeah, Spencer's was like blacklight alien posters, like wildly sexual gifts. Yeah. And yeah, it was the it did well, man. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=976.0s)]
*  That place that store was around forever. They had I believe they had some racial gifts, too. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=986.0s)]
*  I would have one time I saw a hat there. I remember this anyway. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=992.0s)]
*  I saw a hat. It said the N word on the front. Right on the back. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=996.0s)]
*  It said just joking across the back. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1000.0s)]
*  And I'm like, first of all, and we're like trying them on or whatever. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1005.0s)]
*  And I'm like, the odds of first of all, if someone sees the front, they're going to get pissed. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1009.0s)]
*  The last thing you want to do to that person is show them the back. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1013.0s)]
*  Turn your back to them. They're going to beat the punch like, oh, shit, my bad. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1017.0s)]
*  I know you're just fucking around. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1022.0s)]
*  That's crazy. Yeah. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1025.0s)]
*  What happened to Spencer's? Let's find that out because that is I feel like they got bought by Hot Topic, maybe. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1028.0s)]
*  I feel like that also sounds like just two gay dudes that fall like, hey, Spencer and Hot Topic are fucking, you know, flailing it out over there. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1034.0s)]
*  I used to work in the mall. It's like if for real, it's like a it's like a subculture. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1042.0s)]
*  If you're a mall employee, you talk to the other mall employees and you guys like trade discounts with each other. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1047.0s)]
*  I worked at a candy stand in the mall for like three months. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1051.0s)]
*  I did. I had a bad thing. I want to know more about it. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1055.0s)]
*  Let's I want to know what happened to Spencer's real quick, just so we can go ahead. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1058.0s)]
*  Please, please, please. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1061.0s)]
*  Spencer's gift was founded in 1947 in Eastern Pennsylvania by Max Spencer as a mail order catalog, which sold an assortment of novelty merchandise. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1062.0s)]
*  Wow. The company moved all mail order and fulfillment operations to Atlantic City, New Jersey in 1960. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1071.0s)]
*  Still have 650 stores. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1076.0s)]
*  Wow. Whoa. Seagram bought them. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1078.0s)]
*  Oh, they acquired Halloween, Halloween Spirit Halloween, which was a seasonal retailer. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1081.0s)]
*  That all makes sense. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1086.0s)]
*  Spirit of Halloween's are a nice hustle. You open up for like three months, make like probably seventy thousand bucks and just shut them down. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1088.0s)]
*  Yeah. I like I've been peeping those out for a while. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1094.0s)]
*  Yeah. I wouldn't mind getting into something like that. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1097.0s)]
*  That would be nice, man. They're cheap. They cost nothing. You can use them year after year after. They don't spoil. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1099.0s)]
*  Yeah. But then you have a garage full of Freddy masks all year and you can't park in your car. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1104.0s)]
*  You need a big storage space. It is fucked up to have that many Freddy masks, that many bloody plastic butcher knives. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1108.0s)]
*  True. That would be kind of the worst part is you can imagine you coming in, you're drunk a little bit, right? [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1117.0s)]
*  Or peeled up or whatever. Some people in your family are peeled up or your peeled up son drives into the driveway, right? [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1122.0s)]
*  He hits a couple of the boxes, dude. And one of the boxes is those ghosts that's like, [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1128.0s)]
*  That might scare us. And the whole fucking box just starts making that sound. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1135.0s)]
*  Oh my God. That'd be terrifying. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1138.0s)]
*  They get the mash. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1140.0s)]
*  Just motion activated. It's a chorus of skulls. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1142.0s)]
*  Your car hits a box and it fucking just activated it, dude. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1144.0s)]
*  And it's like forty of those bats just singing the graveyard smash. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1148.0s)]
*  Dude, if you can't, especially like a lot of warehouses, you know, businesses go out of business and then it's like, [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1153.0s)]
*  if you're like renting warehouses, they're always full of like a shit of a failed business. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1159.0s)]
*  So you could be like a dark warehouse by yourself and like, what is this stuff? [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1162.0s)]
*  And you just get motion activated on like twenty-five green-eyed cats. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1165.0s)]
*  Businesses are fucking gay, dude, I think, honestly. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1169.0s)]
*  Yeah, they suck. They do suck. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1172.0s)]
*  Yeah, think about it, dude. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1174.0s)]
*  They are. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1177.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1178.0s)]
*  Dude, I was totally, when I was younger, I was completely anti-business. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1179.0s)]
*  I would work retail and I would steal. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1182.0s)]
*  Unfortunately, I would never do that now, but I used to steal badly from, if I liked the person, I wouldn't steal. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1184.0s)]
*  If they were mean, I'd be like, all right, then we'll see about this. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1190.0s)]
*  And I could figure every place has like a giant loophole on the cash register. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1192.0s)]
*  Like there would be like a thing where it's like free baby cone. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1196.0s)]
*  If like a baby comes up, give them a free cone. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1199.0s)]
*  But if anything rang up to exactly like twenty dollars or twenty-five where you didn't have to make change, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1201.0s)]
*  you can just hit free baby cone. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1206.0s)]
*  And then when you go to go to the register, just crumple it all up and like stuff it in your shoe. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1208.0s)]
*  It was bad. It was, yeah, it was very bad. I feel bad about that. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1212.0s)]
*  Have you ever gone and made peace with those people or seek them out? [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1215.0s)]
*  No, because they were my enemies. They were like for real were my enemies. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1218.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. What kind of place was it? [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1221.0s)]
*  One ice cream shop, Brewsters. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1223.0s)]
*  They're fucking good people. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1225.0s)]
*  Well, the manager, they were great. They were fine. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1229.0s)]
*  At the candy place, they were for real dickheads. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1231.0s)]
*  They came, they only wanted high school girls working there. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1233.0s)]
*  And then there was a manager who did a bunch of the place. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1236.0s)]
*  The place was called like Scoop Nuts, which is kind of funny. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1238.0s)]
*  But the there's this lady hired me. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1241.0s)]
*  She had like put in sweat equity, all this stuff. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1245.0s)]
*  And and she was saying like they were trying to like get rid of her. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1248.0s)]
*  You know, again, it's all allegedly. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1251.0s)]
*  I don't want the Scoop Nuts franchise to attack me. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1253.0s)]
*  But finally, it's all rumors. It's all rumors. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1255.0s)]
*  But finally, the owners came in and they were just being father. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1258.0s)]
*  Who hired you? Why are you here? [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1260.0s)]
*  I was like, look, I'm Matt. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1262.0s)]
*  And I'm trying to make money. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1264.0s)]
*  I'm trying to make a living like everybody else. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1265.0s)]
*  I need gas money. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1267.0s)]
*  And then from then on, when I thought the lady owned it, I was straight as an arrow. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1268.0s)]
*  And those two dudes came. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1271.0s)]
*  They were like, the lady was like, they're fucking me. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1272.0s)]
*  You know, this sucks. This is bullshit. I'm so sorry. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1274.0s)]
*  I was like, no problem. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1276.0s)]
*  I knew my time was limited. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1277.0s)]
*  So I cashed up big time. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1278.0s)]
*  Yeah. How much did you take from anything or allegedly take from if you even did it? [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1280.0s)]
*  I mean, it would have been at the time it seemed crazy because I would leave with like 70 bucks a shift and be like, holy fuck. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1284.0s)]
*  That's a lot. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1291.0s)]
*  I was crushing them. I was I was getting after it. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1292.0s)]
*  I was getting after it because that register you just typed out, you weighed it and typed the amount. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1294.0s)]
*  So I'd be like it would weigh a certain thing. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1298.0s)]
*  I was just taxing it. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1300.0s)]
*  Who would order 70 bucks for the nuts? [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1301.0s)]
*  It would be like everything was five to ten bucks. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1303.0s)]
*  But then I could just be like 250. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1305.0s)]
*  I could just type it in the register. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1307.0s)]
*  Baby come, baby come, baby come. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1308.0s)]
*  Cut the fucking weight in half too. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1309.0s)]
*  I feel bad if I ever if they ever reached out, I'd obviously just say it to them. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1311.0s)]
*  Now you can talk right into that camera. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1314.0s)]
*  I got it, man. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1315.0s)]
*  I probably owe them like 500 bucks, which in high school is a lot. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1316.0s)]
*  That's insane amount of money. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1319.0s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1320.0s)]
*  Back then. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1321.0s)]
*  Now that's like almost 20, 30 thousand. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1322.0s)]
*  True. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1326.0s)]
*  With inflation. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1327.0s)]
*  I bought a house. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1328.0s)]
*  I bought my first house off. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1329.0s)]
*  You have a boat. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1333.0s)]
*  It says nuts scooped on the back of it. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1334.0s)]
*  That's the name of it. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1336.0s)]
*  But then, you know, they're probably fine guys. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1337.0s)]
*  I was just getting information. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1339.0s)]
*  You know, when you're 17, you don't know what the fuck's going on. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1340.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1342.0s)]
*  So yeah, I know if you should steal or not. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1343.0s)]
*  Yeah, I was bad on that. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1345.0s)]
*  That was my fault. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1346.0s)]
*  That was a weakness of mine. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1347.0s)]
*  That was a weakness. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1348.0s)]
*  Dude, I was I love to steal. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1349.0s)]
*  What was it about stealing, man? [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1351.0s)]
*  I would try to like let me think of some things that I stole. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1353.0s)]
*  Dude, I stole a buddy of mine's boxers shorts ones. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1357.0s)]
*  I mean, you had some nice ones, right? [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1359.0s)]
*  They were from like Gap or something. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1360.0s)]
*  Or like I don't even know what they had. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1363.0s)]

*  Like it was stunning. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=1383.0s)]

*  Yeah, I remember hearing about that. Yeah, I got did you get it? [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=3970.38s)]

*  Two days. It was a bad fever, and then I coughed up like weird liquids like a month, and I was fine [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=3989.8599999999997s)]

*  Yeah [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=4015.46s)]
*  Beautiful lady very charming [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=4016.78s)]
*  Bridget is that her name? Uh, Brittany. Brittany? Yeah. Brittany is that her name? Yeah [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=4020.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, was that did that ended like just growing up in Philly lead you to that you think? [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=4030.34s)]
*  Dude, I don't know. A chocolatey bride. I've since I was a little kid. It's almost there's my only theory is [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=4035.6200000000003s)]
*  Because like in grade school. I like dated a Mexican lady. I and I've dated everybody [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=4041.92s)]
*  You know like white ladies everything but that was definitely you know, that was something I was drawn to or black women forever [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=4045.68s)]
*  But my only theory is my mom was like super Christian [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=4052.2s)]
*  She still is super Catholic [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=4054.96s)]
*  So she blocked like MTV VH1 all the music channels except for BET because she didn't know it existed [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=4056.7s)]
*  So that was the only music channel I had grown up [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=4062.64s)]
*  So as I had my formative years, I just watched rap video after rap video and I think it might have had some sort of effect [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=4065.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, so that's why I had my money [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=4070.6s)]
*  Um, that's yeah, why that's so interesting dude [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=4074.02s)]
*  Yeah, dude. I remember I made love to a woman who was pretty much black right and [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=4078.58s)]
*  Yeah, it was definitely [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=4086.22s)]
*  There was like more in the um [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=4089.42s)]
*  Muscle or something. I don't know. Yeah, you thought you were impressed by the experience. What do you say pretty much? [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=4092.46s)]
*  She was like what do you she said she was black. I believed her true [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=4096.6s)]
*  You know, I'm not looking at paperwork [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=4100.419999999999s)]
*  Yeah, no, it was like you know pops up on there yeah, I just you know what for me [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=4106.54s)]
*  I they definitely won out for me as well. They won my heart [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=4112.5s)]
*  Collectively they won my heart. Yeah, I just I don't know what it was man. It was just like yeah, you like what you like [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=4115.58s)]
*  Yeah, oh, yeah, I think I was afraid probably a black girl was growing up [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=4120.94s)]
*  They had a lot of the black girls in our town and stuff would get knocked up by the black guys at a young age [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=4124.339999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so all of our black girls disappeared at around 13 years old and got pregnant. Yeah [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=4129.42s)]
*  And then they come back and they're just different or they just like [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=4136.58s)]
*  Yeah, they have a child now or they have like baby milk on their shoulder or whatever [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=4141.18s)]
*  and also I think they had to defend themselves against like like black like [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=4146.9800000000005s)]
*  Dudes in their town or whatever that were like trying to you know, get with them when they were young [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=4151.780000000001s)]
*  So I think they were more into the whole like [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=4156.0599999999995s)]
*  Communicating with guys nature. So I think like a lot of times they would [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=4159.46s)]
*  Like they were just more advanced like the black kids in our school were more sexually advanced [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=4164.74s)]
*  They just had sex earlier and stuff. That was intimidating [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=4169.5s)]
*  The black girls were intimidating because they had more experience. Yeah, it's funny [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=4172.98s)]
*  So much as you talked to a black guy is like I got hit when I was 10. You're like what? [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=4177.98s)]
*  I [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=4181.1s)]
*  Sorry, dude, it's okay [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=4185.06s)]
*  You do hear that a lot you're not wrong. Yeah, you're fine. It is crazy [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=4190.740000000001s)]
*  When you're bro, if somebody put my rainer, okay that God made for me that I kept in my pants for him [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=4195.26s)]
*  If somebody put that in their mouth and I was 10 years old, dude. Oh my god [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=4202.34s)]
*  Over I would have lit a fire in our yard and made smoke [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=4207.9s)]
*  It's over I would I don't know how it's crazy I would have hit him with a wrench or something I just [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=4215.5s)]
*  I would have scared me so much [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=4221.299999999999s)]
*  So that's what so but yeah, so that was kind of crazy. Sorry down if I spit on you or not [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=4223.94s)]
*  Yeah, that yeah that that that kind of stuff's pretty crazy and then I [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=4230.94s)]
*  Get the intimidation factor I do get but I I always uh [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=4235.74s)]
*  Whenever I like will see people and I always just assume I always see like softer sides [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=4239.98s)]
*  It's something I've had my whole life or I can see like kind of like I don't know [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=4244.139999999999s)]
*  I always can see people softer nature because people present one way then you're like with them. Oh, yeah, like it's totally different thing [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=4248.0599999999995s)]
*  Oh, I would marry a black lady. I believe or semi black or whatever for sure all black [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=4253.62s)]
*  I mean, there's so many I mean, I've long been of the belief that [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=4258.179999999999s)]
*  We're gonna it's it's a beige future right in four generations everybody's gonna be beige [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=4261.580000000001s)]
*  Yeah, everybody that's still alive or whatever. We're all gonna be beige bitcoins [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=4266.540000000001s)]
*  You know that will have no sense of faith or hope anymore [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=4271.9400000000005s)]
*  But that's where we'll be true at least we'll be able to context each other online [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=4276.46s)]
*  I think I think we might be in for like a massive spiritual awakening though. It's coming. Well, there's a rumbling [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=4281.540000000001s)]

*  It's like you live your whole life for yourself before you have kids [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=4970.52s)]
*  You're just you know, every single person is just narcissistically self-obsessed. It's just the way we are. Yeah, I am everybody [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=4972.76s)]

*  It's like as an organism we have to be primarily obsessed with ourselves [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=4992.32s)]
*  Oh, it'd be really weird if I was taking care of some kids that weren't mine [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=4995.48s)]
*  That's what I'm saying [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=4998.28s)]
*  Like it just just as a person like if there's a dangerous situate where our bodies are designed to preserve ourselves and to advance our own interests [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=4999.0s)]
*  It's just wow. It's a law of nature. So then when you have a kid [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=5005.8s)]

*  Yeah, babies are initially obsessed with the mother too. They have to be broke the survival [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=5122.32s)]
*  It's a survival some gay baby came over trying to slurp on my chest. It's fucking [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=5126.72s)]
*  Put him to bed early [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=5131.92s)]
*  I would put that fucking fat mac nugget to bed early [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=5134.72s)]
*  The crazy thing I've eaten babies you can be as fat as you want and people fucking love you, dude [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=5139.48s)]
*  It's almost like the Yokozuna in Japan, you know, yeah true. That's actually that's a fair point [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=5144.92s)]
*  But actually people love fat babies man, which is babies women squeeze their cheeks and like so fat [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=5149.96s)]
*  Yeah, they're crazy too. So when you have a kid they like the smell of their baby poop [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=5155.84s)]
*  I've heard this from multiple women like it smells like buttered popcorn. It's dude. It's so gross. Oh, it's disgusting [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=5159.4400000000005s)]
*  But no having kids at school man [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=5165.6s)]
*  It's it's like it'll it definitely for me at least it kind of rocked me to the foundation on one level [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=5167.38s)]
*  But then you're still your normal self, but you're just hyper aware because like I used to have an anger problem [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=5172.52s)]
*  Like I would fucking break glass really. Oh, I was so bad. What do you think it was from? [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=5176.4400000000005s)]

*  I don't know. I mean I can go into depth that I think I could venture a guess that was like [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=5184.320000000001s)]
*  Sometimes in households, there's like certain emotions aren't on display and anger can certainly become a primary emotion [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=5190.320000000001s)]
*  If you're like in a household where people aren't exactly talking and sharing feelings everything gets bottled up [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=5196.240000000001s)]
*  So then every feeling it's channeled into anger eventually [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=5200.96s)]
*  So just becomes like you just becomes natural to you just to fucking spaz so I was just a spaz [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=5203.68s)]
*  I don't know I come from a long line of Irish spaz's so I would just like especially like well [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=5208.56s)]
*  You know in the early stages of our relationship you get into those like those arguments where you're just like I don't you get so [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=5212.6s)]
*  Disoriented because you're like, I don't know if I'm right [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=5218.6s)]
*  I don't know if I'm wrong right you just start to spaz and I would be doing the dishes and just be like [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=5220.36s)]
*  Like smashing glass [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=5224.64s)]
*  But then like yeah once you have like that kind of shit has to stop once you have kids or you can just keep [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=5226.28s)]
*  Going and terrify them. Hmm. So you gotta like, you know, I'd have to like really I had to rein that in [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=5230.679999999999s)]

*  It'd be so scary dude [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=5237.5599999999995s)]

*  Um [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=5251.599999999999s)]

*  I'm trying to be responsible one side of the story is plaguing our country [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=5590.36s)]
*  Plaguing our country the sharing of biased and false news has become all too common on social media [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=5594.96s)]
*  More alarming some media outlets publish these same fake stories without checking facts first the sharing of biased and false news has become [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=5601.0s)]
*  all too common on social media [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=5609.599999999999s)]

*  Now it's like it's like [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=5619.44s)]
*  It's the same reason why it's everything's just kind of the same. It's like [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=5621.639999999999s)]

*  So when people are finally like you can't just expect that people don't have some thing inside of them that detects what? [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=5631.679999999999s)]

*  Just really don't think for themselves that much. Yeah, it's I think it's true [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=5652.599999999999s)]

*  I'm on this stage today and able to be the man I am because I have a wife who leans into her vocation [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6165.34s)]
*  I'm beyond blessed with the many talents God has given me but it cannot be overstated [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6172.66s)]
*  That all of my success is made possible [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6178.14s)]
*  Because a girl I met in being class back in middle school [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6181.66s)]
*  Would convert to the faith you love middle school on [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6187.7s)]

*  What he's yeah [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6209.82s)]

*  that [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6213.82s)]
*  Well, first of all, I do I wonder for our school [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6215.299999999999s)]
*  Does it look at homemaking because we live a lot of people are divorced now people are raised with only one parent [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6217.94s)]
*  Yeah, you know my mother had to work all the time [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6224.0599999999995s)]
*  You know your dad so then your mom has to do both jobs or your dad has to do both jobs a lot of times [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6226.700000000001s)]
*  If you're not able to see both parents [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6231.700000000001s)]
*  It's not a safe place for even an animal to be raised with a single parent [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6233.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, and we promote it. It feels like a lot with our society. It is impossible [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6238.58s)]
*  They should do that social work school. Like there's no difference between having a single parent to but it's like yeah [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6243.620000000001s)]
*  They're what the fuck are you talking about? So did gigantic difference. It's a dude. It'd be impossible [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6247.38s)]
*  I had to raise kids by myself. It's it's for real. It's you can't it's hard to do [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6251.8s)]
*  I'm not gonna say you can't do it, but it's like it is so fucking hard. It's crazy [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6255.56s)]
*  So yeah, I don't think that this I definitely understand where [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6261.14s)]
*  This is a Christian college is Benedictine. It sounds a Christian. Okay, so it's not that crazy, right? [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6265.4400000000005s)]
*  my thing it's it's kind of like I [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6271.280000000001s)]
*  Do feel like you know people do hear hate hearing this but I there is some truth to that in terms of like [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6274.72s)]
*  I do think it's a I [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6281.76s)]
*  Just feel sad if a woman does like it's all like, you know, it has a jammed in her head that she has to like [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6284.08s)]

*  I kind of wish I like having kids is more meaningful than being like an insurance salesman, you know, it was like in terms of experience [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6292.22s)]
*  So yeah, I feel like it's like it's a thing women have is an insecurity that if they don't work [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6298.12s)]
*  They're somehow have been brainwashed into [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6301.88s)]
*  like some old like, you know [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6304.360000000001s)]
*  Outdated value system that like they should fight against it, but you know in reality I do think that a lot of women [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6307.0s)]
*  You know [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6313.719999999999s)]
*  Would probably like to not be at their job and like, you know be at home doing stuff. It's a fucking it is a job [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6314.92s)]
*  It's a massive under undertaking. Well, it's a job that's being it that's not getting done right now [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6319.839999999999s)]

*  So if you show a woman a minivan they'll spaz like that [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6331.4s)]
*  I'd never drive that and they'll drive like a crossover which is just a fucking minivan in disguise [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6333.879999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you can't tell them it's a minivan that you can't they'll spaz but there there is something almost at night a crossover kind [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6337.36s)]

*  I well [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6354.639999999999s)]
*  I also think some of it is an over like there was a time where women like were abused in the workplace [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6355.36s)]
*  They were taken advantage of they were used for sex to get promotions [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6360.64s)]
*  They were promised promotions and not giving them they had no [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6365.04s)]
*  They would go to court but the men in town had the power and they would influence the judges [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6369.52s)]
*  There was no it's a fucking nightmare. It's a nightmare for women to get the equality that they needed for sure [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6374.280000000001s)]
*  Also to just have money really which was the power. Yeah, right. It's definitely been a hell of a journey [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6381.84s)]
*  But yeah, I wonder sometimes if the pendulum will swing back some and you will have more women that are just like I want to be a [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6387.16s)]
*  homemaker [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6394.6s)]
*  And I want to be a good mom and and create create a good household and a lot of the women in our society [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6395.96s)]
*  I think there are reflection of men, you know [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6402.8s)]
*  I think we don't realize that a lot of times like if your wife is happy not all the time. Mm-hmm, but [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6405.92s)]

*  Their of men, you know, does it make any sense it does it makes total sense man [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6415.16s)]
*  Yeah, like if you love your wife and you lift her up and you you know, you then she lives that way [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6420.2s)]
*  Yeah, you know and if as a father you do that probably with your daughters. They live that way. Yeah, you know [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6426.5599999999995s)]

*  Just like all right. I'm done my work. I'm gonna go home. We're gonna watch TV [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6453.639999999999s)]
*  We're gonna chill and I totally get that but yeah, it's it takes a lot of effort and no one's really [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6457.44s)]
*  Incentivizing you toward that effort like with work [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6462.639999999999s)]
*  Everyone's like, you know, they're dangling carrots over your face all you know all day long [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6464.48s)]

*  but I do think women got sold an idea that like they have to be kick-ass business women and like anything less than that is [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6474.4s)]
*  like a failure and like a [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6480.5599999999995s)]
*  Disgrace for like the women struggle and it's like well [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6482.08s)]
*  I think that I think the women struggle helped and people finding out like oh, yeah [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6484.36s)]
*  People were pretty miserable to women for a long time. Yeah, now just let them do whatever they whatever they really want to do [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6487.959999999999s)]
*  Let them do I I get why people are mad at that, but I still I'm like, that's not a bad thing [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6492.36s)]
*  He's genuinely thinks he's trying to help people man. He's not trying to take a dick like stay at home bitch [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6497.24s)]
*  Yeah [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6501.48s)]
*  At one point Bucker mentioned the word pride then clarified that he wasn't talking about the deadly sin sort of pride that has an entire month [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6502.32s)]
*  Dedicated to it about the true God centered pride that is cooperating with the Holy Ghost to glorify him [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6508.08s)]
*  Okay, so he really he's just a devout. He's a devout Christian or Catholic maybe I mean that's the thing is about some of this [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6512.879999999999s)]
*  it's like you can't go to a devout Catholic and [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6520.799999999999s)]
*  Then and expect non devout Catholic shit, you know, that's what I love about like the way the media covers a lot of this stuff [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6524.919999999999s)]
*  It's like yeah, most people might not agree with the guy or some people might not [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6531.16s)]
*  Yeah, but you can't go to a chocolate shop and get pissed when somebody fucking gives you some chocolate. True. Yeah [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6534.92s)]

*  He was in a safe space and you know, it's like if my dad sat in like a liberal safe space he'd be incensed [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6547.48s)]
*  He'd freak. Yeah, so it's like yeah, he doesn't go there. So it's like yeah, I get it [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6552.92s)]
*  It's like dude, I I get if you're gay that would piss you off [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6556.76s)]
*  But if you're not gay or like whatever and if you're like super Christian, you're like fuck [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6559.36s)]
*  Yeah, it all depends on like what you're up to right? [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6562.94s)]
*  There's people for everybody, you know, but we act like sometimes the media acts like there's not people for everybody in a way [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6564.639999999999s)]
*  They only want to create but then that's their job. Yeah, maybe I'm being a downer today [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6570.08s)]
*  No, you're not being a downer. It is like I mean we're having like [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6575.08s)]
*  There's a guy Ken Wilbur who writes it. I think it's like the best take on this I've ever heard about how [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6579.32s)]
*  Historically human beings have gone through just different levels of just consciousness consciousness where it's like like originally [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6584.6s)]
*  the thing that like [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6591.52s)]
*  Motivated humans like the highest ideal is just being powerful and dominating others [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6593.4400000000005s)]
*  So if you're a Roman if you're like, you know, like Alexander the Great if you went and fucked up a whole bunch of people [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6597.2s)]
*  You were like you would be like God loves me. This is awesome [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6604.12s)]
*  And then we kind of evolved into like Christianity and all that, you know [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6606.88s)]
*  Whatever that was kind of like actually, you know [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6610.4400000000005s)]
*  We should be nicer to each other and then we came up like we should be nice to other Christians and like kind of fuck [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6612.64s)]
*  Everybody else and we went from like they call it like power gods to mythic membership and then for mythic membership to the scientific worldview [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6617.08s)]
*  and they're saying the last one the newest worldview has been this kind of like [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6623.92s)]
*  woke kind of idiot like postmodern woke ideology and now we have people at different levels of this and they're all just entrenched in their [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6628.08s)]
*  World view and fighting each other. Mm-hmm [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6633.84s)]
*  And he's like it's just gonna go on, you know until people are just like, alright, fuck it and they transcend all from the like [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6635.280000000001s)]
*  Which you do your thing I get it. I don't agree but like I don't hate you because of it. Yeah, that's the part [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6639.56s)]
*  Yeah, I think hating people because of it's bizarre to me, but I'm not shot it like a [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6645.0s)]
*  Christian guy at a Christian college said some really Christian shit he did [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6652.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, so it's like that to me. It's not even fucking news, you know, it's like let him be who he wants to be [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6656.360000000001s)]
*  You know said I love my wife and I'm not gay. It's like yeah, that's for sure [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6662.240000000001s)]

*  Yeah, I think the guy should be able to speak. Um, you said a little bit ago [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6673.6s)]
*  Do you think there's like a wave of faith wave that's starting up things? Oh, can I pee real quick? [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6677.160000000001s)]

*  According to Scientific American mammals that weigh more than six and a half pounds [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6742.28s)]
*  That's us take about 21 seconds to urinate [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6745.599999999999s)]

*  Mm-hmm. Oh, no when you pass the stool the relaxation of the stronger anal sphincter [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6752.8s)]
*  Decreases tension in the weaker urinary sphincter allowing urine to pass at the same time. Okay [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6757.0s)]
*  Is that's what does that fact mean that you can pee while you poop? [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6762.5599999999995s)]

*  They would know immediately when I went in there like he'd yeah he did it [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6792.08s)]
*  You were talking about faith man, you think there's gonna be like, um [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6798.24s)]
*  People need something. I do think that [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6801.92s)]
*  not having faith is [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6805.24s)]
*  There's something that's not how people the rest of this seems fucking [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6808.5599999999995s)]
*  Aimless life starts to seem kind of aimless and purposeless. That's the thing. Yeah. Yeah [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6812.96s)]
*  I don't I honestly like, you know, it was like like Bill Maher was all about this way back in the day when he did [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6817.8s)]
*  religious where he went around and like debated like [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6822.360000000001s)]
*  conservative Baptist Christians down south and was like you actually think a guy in the sky and it's like that whole arguments ridiculous [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6826.0s)]
*  But it was cool to be atheistic back when like there were still kind of like a stronghold of religion [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6832.68s)]
*  But now like we've lost it all and it's dude. It's terrifying to be like we're just totally alone [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6837.92s)]
*  We're like a cosmic mistake that's just like here like a fucking amoeba just eating and shitting it's I [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6842.88s)]
*  think [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6849.88s)]
*  Now that it's completely collapsed it'll get rebuilt in I think a more thoughtful kind of way where it isn't like, you know [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6851.56s)]
*  A literal interpretation if that's people's thing right [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6857.8s)]
*  But there's like there it's evolved a lot in terms of like the concept of God [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6860.0s)]
*  What it could possibly mean like the consciousness in the universe [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6863.6s)]
*  They're just and then like you take like the eastern stuff that's kind of blending in and then you add YouTube [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6866.92s)]
*  Which is like now people can learn about anything kind of [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6871.48s)]
*  Reconceptualize their own connection to God rather than just kind of like being in Sunday school [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6874.08s)]
*  And you know and having someone just being like this is how this works because there's like with religion again [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6878.5s)]
*  This is more just Ken Wilber stuff. He talks about there's like translative religions where it's like them and he's a human being Ken Wilber [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6883.32s)]
*  Yeah, he's human being he's doing his stuff. I think he's one of the smartest guys out there still alive [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6889.4s)]
*  Yeah, he's still alive. He lives. I think he lives in Boulder. He's a 75 [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6894.48s)]
*  But yeah, so he he talked about let's keep that in the list bro. He would be a fantastic get [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6898.360000000001s)]
*  But he talks about this how a lot of the religion people grew up with here is like translative [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6904.08s)]
*  We're just kind of like here's how the universe was built. Here's what happened then and it doesn't there's no [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6908.64s)]
*  process toward [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6913.8s)]
*  Like transforming yourself. He's like there's translative and then there's transformative religion a lot of the eastern stuff is more about like transforming yourself [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6915.58s)]
*  But then that you know, whatever so like I think within within here if people can get kind of start to learn about they are [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6922.6s)]
*  Pathways to transform yourself over an entire lifetime to make you a more loving person and like, you know, you can tap it [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6928.92s)]
*  Whatever. I don't know. I'm like out of my element with you sound insane a little but I [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6935.84s)]
*  Also think that you're a very smart guy and a super communicative guy man, but I think um, yeah [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6940.52s)]
*  I think there is it is getting I was just checking. No, it's funny [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6946.68s)]
*  And I do I lose the thread hard on myself, that's oh, I hate that dude dude [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6950.24s)]
*  It happens to me all the time. I swear I'm like I'm right there [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6954.12s)]
*  It's like we tell people to come over you're gonna show him something and then nothing there [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6957.64s)]
*  But it's like 30 feet away. I can feel it. That's the problem. I can feel it. I just can't put it into words [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6962.08s)]
*  Oh, yeah, dude. Um, imagine how Biden feels [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6967.0s)]
*  I make fun of him all the time. I'm just as bad as him. I'm like [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6971.72s)]
*  Oh [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6975.160000000001s)]
*  But they're like when you do learn about stuff like that imagine when he closes eyes he just see it's just like a page [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6976.400000000001s)]
*  You need a caramel or whatever [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6981.240000000001s)]
*  There's nothing in there [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6983.52s)]
*  He's just being used obviously by the new Jim Henson, whoever those people are [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6986.120000000001s)]
*  But no there is something about religion there is something about like [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6992.52s)]
*  Yeah, having faith having believing in something that's greater than us [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6996.120000000001s)]
*  And yeah, I think maybe we get away from like the word it's like not as locked into the words of things but more about [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=6999.8s)]
*  The feeling and what it means to be human [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=7006.52s)]
*  and then also like if you use certain religions if Christianity or [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=7009.6s)]
*  Mohammed ism or whatever is your [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=7015.200000000001s)]
*  Pathway to believe in faith then that's just your that's your pathway [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=7018.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think we're getting past the point of like thinking that no one else can have another pathway to like [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=7022.22s)]
*  That seems kind of outdated, you know, that's the Ken Wilbur guy [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=7028.12s)]
*  So that's that's an example of mythic membership or you're like my group has absolute direct access to reality [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=7031.36s)]
*  Everyone else is wrong and he says what we're all get to eventually is called tier two thinking where you go [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=7037.2s)]
*  Like I can see where you're coming from. This is kind of my thing. I what you're doing sick [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=7041.92s)]
*  We're all kind of doing, you know, the same thing in essence with like different, you know [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=7045.78s)]
*  We got like different clothes on turn in terms of our thoughts. We're all doing the same thing [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=7048.400000000001s)]
*  But yeah, dude, it's like there's like dude if without I think if you're if you're religious like actually religious [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=7051.92s)]
*  Like you have like a spirit real spiritual connection. I think on average you live like eight years longer [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=7056.52s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy. The study and the studies are just like irrefutable [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=7060.200000000001s)]
*  Well, imagine just the only thing that you cared about. I mean I even notice as I get older [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=7064.360000000001s)]
*  It's like I don't have a family where I don't have a wife or children [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=7068.96s)]
*  I'm at home sometimes and I'm like, what am I even doing? Yeah. Yeah, I've done that myself where you sit there and you're like [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=7073.68s)]
*  What am I gonna do now? What is the purpose of any or what is like? [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=7079.96s)]
*  Like there's purposeful stuff that happens in moments and things to think about and enjoy and I'm not being like a downer about myself [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=7083.8s)]
*  Or about my life, but just like yeah what there isn't [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=7089.84s)]
*  There must be something greater right than just this and so yeah, I think family helps you see that [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=7094.0s)]
*  Believing in something getting up every day and believing that the universe cares about you [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=7101.04s)]
*  Yeah [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=7104.64s)]
*  I think having a society that reflects that we care about each other and that the we care about [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=7105.08s)]
*  The universe and that it cares about us too, you know [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=7110.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, it's not that crazy to be like like we're we somehow consciousness emerged within our heads [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=7113.28s)]
*  Why would it not be something prevalent? [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=7119.599999999999s)]
*  You like why would it not be in the universe itself to make the universe at whole isn't conscious but somehow out of unconsciousness [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=7122.16s)]
*  We have consciousness. Yeah, it gets real crazy. It is it's for total cap, but it's like in cap as fuck, dude [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=7128.36s)]
*  It's not like a universe that can't think made something that could think dude [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=7135.08s)]
*  And designed itself [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=7138.36s)]
*  Perfectly, it's unbelievable [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=7140.48s)]
*  The way it's set up Lee so yeah, that's for me the older I've gotten I've been like [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=7142.48s)]
*  You know, and that's why they called faith [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=7147.639999999999s)]
*  It's like I can't prove it but it's like I will definitely hedge my bets on like dude the universe [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=7149.2s)]
*  It's it's on it's also like it's like a like an ant trying to explain Florida to like they can't man [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=7152.92s)]
*  I can't comprehend Florida but like for some reason humans have this inkling that there is something beyond themselves and it's universe [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=7158.5599999999995s)]
*  Totally universal too. That's a good point dude. Totally universal and human beings throughout pretty much all of time [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=7164.24s)]
*  Yeah, you'd have to how could you trick you could never and it's not even like I don't even know a ton about religion [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=7170.88s)]

*  There's something happening here [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=7179.679999999999s)]
*  You go I am that sky there's a man with a gun over there and now we're back in Philadelphia [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3GWBbfvbU&t=7187.32s)]
