*  You know, it just wasn't readily available so [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=519.64s)]

*  Four years at this school and I didn't learn jack gang gang. There you go, brother [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=1463.48s)]
*  and I remember doing uh mushrooms one time at school and [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=1469.32s)]
*  I remember thinking my shirt was a snake [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=1474.4399999999998s)]
*  Because I'd worn a felt made shirt made out of pool table felt they had a guy in our town for a while [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=1477.48s)]
*  His wife had died and uh [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=1485.1599999999999s)]
*  And so he he was doing uh making shirts out of felt out of pool table [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=1489.8799999999999s)]
*  You know, they had a bad batch of pool tables in this town next to us called bogalusa, louisiana someone had made [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=1495.1599999999999s)]
*  Pool tables and the wood that they used had termites in it [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=1501.8s)]
*  And beautiful tables, but they're disappearing [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=1505.72s)]
*  You know, you could barely get halfway through a game of damn nine ball and uh, [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=1509.4s)]
*  One of the legs be missing off of the thing [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=1513.24s)]
*  You know, and now you want to get one of the pockets is uphill suddenly [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=1516.2s)]
*  So, uh [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=1521.48s)]
*  This fella in our town got the felt off of the tables that green felton made shirts out of them beautiful shirts [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=1522.84s)]
*  And he marketed it as christmas apparel [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=1530.44s)]
*  And um [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=1532.54s)]
*  And so I got one man, you know, I was lucky enough to cop one of them [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=1534.94s)]
*  There's only probably about 11 or 15 of them [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=1538.7s)]
*  And I got one and I remember eating mushrooms and wearing it at school when I thought my arm was a snake [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=1541.5s)]
*  And that's one of the side effects of eating uh psilocybin mushrooms it'll snake your arm out [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=1548.22s)]
*  You know what i'm saying? You'll be sitting there in class and next thing you know, your arm is eating a white mouth [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=1555.34s)]
*  You're like damn, okay [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=1560.46s)]
*  Okay, we we getting vibey today [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=1563.18s)]
*  Okay today the science lesson is in my brain [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=1567.5s)]
*  So i'm you know geeked up and uh, so I excuse myself from the classroom and I try to excuse myself from [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=1573.42s)]
*  my arms [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=1580.54s)]
*  But you can't do that [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=1582.7s)]
*  But you can't do that [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=1584.7s)]
*  So I went into the bathroom and I stayed in there for about four hours at school in the bathroom and [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=1588.06s)]
*  Because I could things were a little more manageable in there [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=1595.5800000000002s)]
*  You know you could pee or you could do the sink or you could you know [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=1599.5800000000002s)]
*  You got to meet everybody if there were kids you didn't know everybody has to bathroom [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=1605.9s)]
*  And so that was the beauty of being in there was you got to meet people you didn't know [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=1610.8600000000001s)]
*  you [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=1615.3400000000001s)]
*  but um [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=1616.54s)]
*  The weird part was when you'd be in there and they'd come back to urinate for the second time [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=1618.7s)]
*  Because on average people would urinate probably two and a half times during the day three times [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=1623.42s)]
*  And uh [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=1630.22s)]
*  So when you saw some guys for the second time they would that was a little weird [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=1632.3s)]
*  Because it's easy to kind of [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=1638.6200000000001s)]
*  Understand why somebody's in the bathroom one time it's harder to understand [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=1641.4199999999998s)]
*  Why they're still in the bathroom hours later when you go back in [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=1647.1s)]
*  And they're still in there just doing toilet sink sink sink toilet [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=1651.26s)]
*  Sink [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=1656.3s)]

*  And a couple came to mind when I was listening [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=2151.44s)]
*  The first one is from the louisiana bad boy the rat king. Mr. Theo von. I think it's words to live by [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=2154.56s)]
*  Right in there be good to yourself. You probably deserve it. Amen if I could go back write those words [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=2163.68s)]
*  That's much better than whatever I wrote something stupid that I thought was funny at the time [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=2171.2s)]
*  But you live by those words and I honestly think that that's going to make you happier [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=2177.2s)]
*  Now the other quote probably not school [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=2183.2s)]
*  And that's true, man [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=2186.96s)]
*  You know, it's so funny how many guys i'll run into and and women occasionally but mostly men and [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=2189.04s)]
*  And we'll just share that back to me say be good to yourself [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=2195.44s)]
*  You know be good to yourself [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=2199.76s)]
*  It's hard, isn't it? [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=2202.56s)]
*  It's hard brian. It's hard to be good to ourselves [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=2205.52s)]
*  And I don't know if it's because we spend so much time around ourselves, I don't know if it's [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=2214.48s)]
*  that [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=2219.44s)]
*  You got to be tougher on who you you know [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=2220.96s)]
*  But it's hard it's hard man. So thank you for that. Well that well-wished baby. Now, let's uh, let's hear the other one [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=2225.28s)]
*  That that's gonna make you happier [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=2232.08s)]
*  Now the other quote probably not school appropriate [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=2235.04s)]
*  But it was the clip you played after the high school senior called in [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=2239.44s)]
*  And some elderly woman was screaming at somebody [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=2243.84s)]
*  And she said if I want to fuck I can fuck [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=2246.8799999999997s)]
*  It ain't nobody business but mine [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=2251.52s)]
*  If your school will let you print it also [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=2255.2s)]
*  Good words to live by [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=2259.04s)]
*  But that's it man. I hope I hope this senior can find something good. I would go with the rat king [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=2261.52s)]
*  And uh, I hope you be good to yourself man [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=2268.7999999999997s)]
*  You deserve it [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=2272.4799999999996s)]
*  Gang brother. Thanks brian. I like that second one man. I'm gonna play yours again [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=2274.16s)]
*  If I want to fuck I can fuck [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=2279.52s)]
*  It ain't nobody business, but mine [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=2282.72s)]
*  There you go [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=2287.2799999999997s)]
*  And we should start a senior yearbook for actual seniors. That's what it should be [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=2289.68s)]
*  Somebody should just make a yearbook of all the old people in their town and say this is our senior yearbook [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=2294.7999999999997s)]
*  And you go around and get them to sign it now [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=2300.64s)]
*  You know what i'm saying people be writing real stuff [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=2304.24s)]
*  you know [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=2308.24s)]
*  That would be amazing just to get you know [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=2310.72s)]
*  to really get on [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=2314.0s)]
*  To just really just to capture that last hurrah [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=2316.8799999999997s)]
*  And then you compare it [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=2321.6s)]
*  Or maybe like our high school should come back years later and get a quote later on [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=2323.6s)]
*  You know [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=2330.3999999999996s)]
*  That's what they should do [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=2333.28s)]

*  They sit in there and they kind of are unique, but they're really just a fucking plant [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=2909.7s)]
*  And they want water and then they uh [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=2914.4199999999996s)]
*  You know they um [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=2918.4199999999996s)]
*  And that's it man, they just want some water because they're so high [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=2921.7799999999997s)]
*  So [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=2926.8999999999996s)]
*  I think here's one thing that i'd use to help quit. I just quit. I quit smoking cigarettes, you know about almost a year ago now [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=2927.8599999999997s)]
*  Dude, actually in april. It'll be a year. Wow [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=2934.66s)]
*  And the thing that helped me quit [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=2939.22s)]
*  I was in kawaii, man kawaii, hawaii [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=2942.18s)]
*  And a man I met a man by a smoothie shop and he was a shaman [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=2946.58s)]
*  You know, he was off work [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=2951.2999999999997s)]
*  smoothie guy shaman guy [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=2954.08s)]
*  And [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=2958.4199999999996s)]
*  Next thing, you know him him and his old lady got me back at their joint [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=2960.2599999999998s)]
*  They got a you know, kind of a low-key child care kind of center also, but they smoked they have dmt over there [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=2963.3799999999997s)]
*  And they had that five m. E. O [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=2970.02s)]
*  DMT that smoky treat baby that brain smoothie, you know what i'm talking about [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=2972.56s)]
*  That buck and turn your whole life into a damn skill crane baby in the claw [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=2977.46s)]
*  The lord comes out and just picks things out of you that he don't want to be there anymore [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=2980.98s)]
*  And one of the things [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=2986.74s)]
*  That the lord's mighty arm picked right out of me was my desire to smoke cigarettes [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=2989.22s)]
*  Because dmt I find it'll put the wheels on your wants [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=2993.96s)]
*  Sometimes your very core has wants inside of it it has things it wants to do [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=2999.0s)]
*  And if they just it don't they don't have the wheels it don't have the downhill they don't have the gradient [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=3006.44s)]
*  But that dmt will get in there and do that dirty work, you know [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=3012.28s)]
*  It'll tickle your sister but buy her a house, you know what i'm saying? It does the thing [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=3018.04s)]
*  You can't really you don't want to do [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=3021.72s)]
*  And that's what it did for me man it got inside of me and I went from literally [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=3025.24s)]
*  Each day i'd be in my head like okay. Am I gonna and I wasn't a heavy smoker, but I'd smoke a couple at night [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=3030.4399999999996s)]
*  And I had a crutch I would smoke when I didn't want to that was it I would smoke when I didn't want to [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=3039.7999999999997s)]
*  That was it I didn't I was smoking I didn't want to [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=3046.04s)]
*  And anytime I had a problem or an uncertainty or a non-surity [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=3050.36s)]
*  Or anything I would just I would go smoke I would it became my god in a weird way when I had a question [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=3058.92s)]
*  A worry a thought a concern of or a positive feeling. Let's smoke. Let's smoke. Oh, let's celebrate. Let's smoke [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=3064.36s)]
*  Oh damn bummer. Let's smoke [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=3070.76s)]
*  It became where I went when I had a feeling of any sort [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=3073.7200000000003s)]
*  So it was so nice when it disappeared I mean literally [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=3081.5600000000004s)]
*  It just that that that five course meal baby that five meo dmt just took it completely out of my [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=3086.0400000000004s)]
*  my history [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=3093.32s)]
*  And so that's what I think that that kind of stuff can do is that uh, it's the librarian [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=3096.28s)]
*  Inside of you that we all need [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=3101.08s)]
*  So, I don't know if that helps to suggest your brother smoke dmt to quit smoking weed, but [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=3104.52s)]
*  But also I think he has you have to want it [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=3110.28s)]
*  That's what i'm saying. I think he puts the wheels on your wants [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=3113.88s)]
*  So if he wants it, it can happen if he don't want it then I think it it won't happen [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=3116.84s)]
*  It has to be a want that's been that's been occurring in your in your background [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=3123.56s)]
*  You know, it has to be a want that's just sitting on the stem of your spine waiting for a ride home [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=3128.44s)]
*  But you you don't you don't have the power to make it happen [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=3134.6s)]
*  And that dmt does that dirty work that's what it does. So I think that um [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=3138.8399999999997s)]
*  That that's a possibility, but sometimes you got to let people run their course with drugs [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=3144.92s)]
*  Uh, so but i'm sorry. I just think I think overall it's just [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=3151.96s)]
*  Nice that you care what's going on with your brother at all, you know [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=3154.76s)]
*  And I think I think things are okay in moderation if he can handle it [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=3159.88s)]
*  Uh, but if he wants to quit and he can't then that's when I think that um [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=3164.92s)]
*  That dmt could be an answer for and could possibly save y'all's brother ship [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnl5BdcUBUo&t=3170.44s)]
