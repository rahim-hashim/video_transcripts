*  about jockeying. I've always wanted to know about it. You know what I'm saying? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  Who's in that cockpit of that horse? Today's guest is Mr. Mario Gutierrez. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=26.56s)]
*  Mario Gutierrez, man. So what happened man? You had some... [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=56.56s)]
*  What happened yesterday? You said something happened. I was riding a couple of things. My car broke down yesterday so I took it to the dealership. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=72.4s)]
*  On the interstate or on a side road? No, I was in the highway. That's always a real roadie of road when you break down out there. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=80.12s)]
*  It was a brand new car too so I don't know what happened. Yeah I had to take it to the [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=88.60000000000001s)]
*  dealership and then get a loaner car and this morning I had to go to the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=93.44s)]
*  track to like do the training the usual training that I had to do before [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=98.68s)]
*  racing. Okay. I was doing that. I was getting ready to leave, grab a couple [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=102.0s)]
*  things to show you guys and then as I was getting out of the racetrack [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=106.56s)]
*  freaking car power went off. Same thing happened. The loaner car broke down too. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=112.44000000000001s)]
*  I called my agent on the way and then he loaned me his car. And he's like get out of here. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=120.68s)]
*  And so when you go and let's put it what brand of car is it man? Let's get this [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=125.72s)]
*  brand out there. Oh I don't even want to say it. You don't? It's a fancy car [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=131.12s)]
*  actually. It is? It is. BMW maybe? No, Up. Up? Yeah. Oh Range Rover. And in that area is like a [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=135.6s)]
*  Maserati. Oh wow yeah it's a Maserati. Yeah. You drive a Maserati? Well no that was a [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=145.2s)]
*  loaner car. I drive an Alfa Romeo. Oh that's what Nick drives. And then the [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=150.72s)]
*  engine light went on in that car. That's what happened like I was driving and [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=157.0s)]
*  then the power went off. Like probably a bicycle could have run faster than that. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=160.72s)]
*  And when the power goes out in your car do you kind of get that same feeling? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=164.96s)]
*  I actually do. I was like come on come on. Just one more pull you have to do. Oh I did that. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=167.84s)]
*  Actually I did that. I can see that it's almost like a habit. Yeah yeah I was like [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=174.72s)]
*  even when I watch my replays when I like after like the race finish and I come [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=178.8s)]

*  which? Mexican. Both your parents are Mexican? Yeah both my parents. So are is there a lot of Mexican [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=631.04s)]
*  jockeys as well? Oh yeah yeah. Really? A lot of jockeys a lot of Latino jockeys a lot of Panamanians, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=635.36s)]
*  Puerto Ricans. So yeah it's because it's interesting that a lot of those guys are [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=642.24s)]
*  from Louisiana and then a lot of them are from Mexico. Why? Because it's smaller stature? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=647.36s)]
*  I think so but there's really jockeys all over the place. We have like Italian jockeys here right now. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=653.2s)]
*  We have a French jockeys you know. I think it's like whoever is small enough to get jockeys. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=658.24s)]
*  So it's more about a size thing that really it doesn't matter kind of where people are from. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=665.2s)]
*  What was your journey in a jockey and like how did it kind of start out for you? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=669.1999999999999s)]
*  Because it's such a unique I mean I was talking to a friend of mine the other day [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=673.68s)]
*  this guy Walker Bueller he plays for the Dodgers actually and he was on here a while back and he [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=678.96s)]
*  and I went to dinner the other night he's telling me about he had a brother-in-law who was a jockey [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=686.56s)]
*  and Robbie Alborado is the guy's name and so he went so I was like maybe we should get a jockey [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=693.04s)]
*  to come on the podcast and talk and then you and Nick spoke and so yeah man it's just fascinating [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=700.0799999999999s)]
*  to think of what that life is like and who even does it like so take me again a little bit more [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=706.3199999999999s)]
*  like your fitness and your size and your weight what do you have to stay at? I probably if you [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=713.28s)]
*  I had to stay like under like 117, 118, 117 you know that in case that I have to reduce [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=718.72s)]
*  I don't have to reduce too much you know like if I have to ride horses with like 118 I only had to [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=725.04s)]
*  pull up two pounds the day of the race you know something like that you know that I try to manage [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=729.52s)]
*  that like really well. Do they weigh you before the race? Each race before each race they weigh you. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=733.76s)]
*  And if you're over can the trainer the owner say we're going to get someone else? I think we're [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=739.36s)]
*  only allowed to be like you have to if I'm gonna be if I think I'm not gonna make that weight I had [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=744.56s)]
*  to report it like an hour earlier before the before the first race so if I already know that [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=750.16s)]
*  hey I can make that weight I'm gonna be one point over I have to if I don't do that then yeah we [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=756.64s)]
*  get penalized or I think yeah the trainer is allowed to say well I don't I need to replace my [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=760.7199999999999s)]
*  jockey. So on the race day that's usually the same jockeys like on a scheduled day of races at like [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=766.7199999999999s)]
*  um say it like um Santa Anita right? Santa Ana what is it? Santa Anita. Santa Anita right so on [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=773.12s)]
*  a scheduled day of races there may be like 10 races or something for the day? Yeah today are 11. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=781.36s)]
*  Wow so you're gonna race 11 times? No no I only ride four horses four races. And is it every other [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=786.24s)]
*  race how do they put you guys in there? It depends it's very complicated right because like that [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=792.4s)]
*  is in the racing office they decide what race goes first what race goes second so it's like depends [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=797.52s)]
*  if you know depends where where I land you know I can ride the first four but not necessarily like [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=803.76s)]
*  or I can run the first and third six seven. So do you ride for a specific trainer do you ride on a [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=811.04s)]
*  specific horse like how does who does the jockey work for? I'm very lucky that I ride for a specific [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=818.0s)]
*  owner. Okay yeah so you ride only on his horses? I ride most all of his horses I ride all of them [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=825.44s)]
*  and that has been since 2002. I'm very very lucky so I'm a very very sweet position that that way [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=832.5600000000001s)]
*  so I'm not specifically for the same trainer for the owner you know so that's that's good for me. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=840.48s)]
*  So you have more like that that means you just have like more of a long term or you just have [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=848.1600000000001s)]
*  a work what's it called Nick? Work if you have the same job at a long time? A tenure? Yeah or yeah [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=853.6s)]
*  you just have like some assurance you're more assured like do you have a contract kind of? [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=861.36s)]
*  It's like it's not like a real contract it's more like a spoken contract you know like a like a [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=865.36s)]
*  French like he's been so loyal to me and I've been loyal to him so like it's just like a [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=870.1600000000001s)]
*  Partnership. Partnership that is cash continued we had early success in 2012 I think that's what [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=874.8000000000001s)]
*  security yeah yeah some job security yeah yeah so uh so then so when you get on the horse you're [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=880.96s)]
*  on the horse and you take the horse out to the what? To the racetrack? To like the boating booth [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=888.8s)]

*  I think that any sport has like, like, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1239.96s)]
*  there's some groupies. I think so. Yeah. Yeah. That's cool, man. Um, [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1242.8400000000001s)]
*  what type of like, who are the owners these days? Like a lot of times, [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1247.3600000000001s)]
*  when I think of horse owners, I think of like a rich old white guy, kind of, [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1251.88s)]
*  is that still kind of the, and no judgment against it, [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1255.44s)]
*  but is that still like the type of person that owns horses? Do you like, [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1258.5200000000002s)]
*  or is there all types? Yeah. I think of this guy, whoever this guy is. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1263.7600000000002s)]
*  We don't know who this guy is, but that's who we think of. Is this, [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1267.24s)]
*  does this look like every owner kind of, or is it all types of people? [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1270.96s)]
*  It's all type of like, well, they basically, whoever owns a horse, [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1274.1200000000001s)]
*  like they have money. Right. They have a lot of money. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1277.0s)]
*  Okay. So with someone that has expendable income, they could get a horse. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1279.16s)]
*  So like, I don't think necessarily has to be white, but it needs, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1281.72s)]
*  it needs to have some cash. So they need to have some cash. Yeah. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1285.92s)]
*  Do they ever have groups out there where you, where you feel like it's a, um, [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1288.44s)]
*  like it's a setup, like they have like a shady owner or it seems like a little [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1293.3600000000001s)]
*  weird, like, like the, [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1297.08s)]
*  like maybe they're just trying to drug a horse and get it through. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1298.84s)]
*  Does that ever happen or did it used to happen? [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1301.76s)]
*  Do you ever notice anything like that? [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1304.1599999999999s)]
*  I don't like, I don't, that I don't know, I specifically, [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1307.36s)]
*  specifically know, you know, like, uh, I said it again, you know, [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1310.72s)]
*  because like, like, like a group or like, [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1314.08s)]
*  like I guess do you ever see like, is there ever like, um, [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1316.56s)]
*  like a owner trainer kind of a, a team, [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1321.28s)]
*  Oh, a team that tried to do that. Yeah. Often. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1325.8s)]
*  And it just like, and maybe the, [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1329.52s)]
*  you've seen them over the years and they come and gone or whatever, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1330.68s)]
*  but has there ever, is there a lot of that going on or is stuff pretty right? [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1332.8s)]
*  Like is it. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1336.28s)]
*  Maybe back in the days will happen a lot and no, not in racetracks like, like, [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1337.4s)]
*  like Santa Anita that will, that will be considered like a, like, like a, in, [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1341.92s)]
*  I will be concerned. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1350.16s)]
*  Then they will be considered like, you know, like one of the top racetracks, [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1351.0s)]
*  Santa Anita, New York and talk to you, you know, like, and, and then prestigious, [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1353.84s)]
*  you know, like, and like an elite or like an a racetrack racetrack. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1357.76s)]
*  And then you, you have B racetrack, C racetrack, you know, and that probably, [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1361.8s)]
*  probably will cure more into like, like small racetrack where there is not a lot [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1365.72s)]
*  of your restriction or not a lot of people watching. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1369.44s)]
*  Like I wouldn't be surprised if that those type of things happen there. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1372.24s)]
*  Oh, it gets a little more seedier the way the further you go. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1375.0s)]
*  Yeah. Maybe like, for example, like UFC, I watched a lot of fights, you know, [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1378.36s)]
*  like say UFC now with you sat and everything is like cracking down and things [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1381.96s)]
*  like that. But the more you go to the lesser organization, well, [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1385.4s)]
*  maybe they're not as tight, you know? So, [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1388.16s)]
*  Oh, the urinal you could drink it. I feel like I'm happy. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1389.92s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? I'd had a glass of whatever Anderson Silva had in my [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1392.8400000000001s)]
*  thing. I mean, they just had, yeah, it's definitely a lot cleaner these days. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1396.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Um, who are some of the fighters you like? [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1399.72s)]
*  Oh, I like a bunch. You do like Nate, the Nick Bro. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1402.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. So far to love. Yeah. Um, [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1405.8400000000001s)]
*  I wish Nick fought more, man. I know. I don't know what's up with him. I wish, [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1409.52s)]
*  I wish to, I, I, I get it. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1413.16s)]
*  I just don't want him to get older and then wish he had fought more younger. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1415.16s)]
*  Yeah. Well, you never know with those guys, right? He, they, [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1419.72s)]
*  they really seem so genuine, you know, that like the way I look at him, [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1422.56s)]
*  I don't think that will occur to him, you know? Yeah, that's a good point. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1427.2s)]
*  He probably just, you know, he do what he wants. It seems like, so, [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1431.0s)]
*  I think they definitely do what they want. Yeah. Yeah. Did you see that? [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1434.96s)]
*  Fight the other night with Edwards? Yeah. That was good. Yeah. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1439.4s)]
*  Come on, go for the kill. He's pointing at him and I'm like, [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1443.0400000000002s)]
*  my wife is yelling. I'm yelling. My son is looking at us like, [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1447.2800000000002s)]
*  what the heck is going on with you guys? Yeah. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1450.52s)]
*  Yeah. That was magical, man. Yeah. What do you think about the, uh, [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1458.76s)]
*  did you see the last Poirier, uh, McGregor fight? Yeah. I was surprised. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1462.3200000000002s)]
*  I was surprised that, uh, how fairly easy, uh, Poirier beat McGregor. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1466.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. I think McGregor beats him this time. You think so? I think so. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1471.32s)]
*  I feel like it's, I mean, I definitely don't think that, [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1475.56s)]
*  but I think it's hard to come. I just think it's hard to like, [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1478.6399999999999s)]
*  get that mentality, you know? [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1482.96s)]
*  Oh, but unless he doesn't have that anymore, you know, I, [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1485.08s)]
*  I will blame the first, the first fight until like, you know, he's like, [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1488.24s)]
*  you know, long time hasn't fight, you know, and then like, that's, [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1491.1999999999998s)]
*  that's what I think, you know, but, and I will relate it again to horses. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1495.56s)]
*  There is some horses that, you know, [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1498.6399999999999s)]
*  the very good horses that undefeated, like they can win one, two, three, [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1500.8799999999999s)]
*  four, five races in a row. And the moment they touch the feet, [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1505.76s)]
*  the moment somebody, so other horse pass them, they never the same. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1508.96s)]
*  Really? Yeah. So that thing happens to fighters too. You know, the more, [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1512.8799999999999s)]
*  you know, they feel this thing and all of a sudden the, you know, two, [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1516.84s)]
*  three losses and yeah, like mess up with their head. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1519.6399999999999s)]
*  Happens to comedians too, man. Happened to me. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1522.4399999999998s)]
*  But no, that's so interesting. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1526.0s)]
*  So you there's, there can be like a moment that happened in a race, [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1527.32s)]
*  like in a big race where another horse passes it and it's never the same. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1530.32s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. For horses. It happened to me. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1533.8s)]
*  It happened to a very good horse that I had. Really? Which one was it? [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1536.36s)]
*  What was it? Nyquist 2016, Kentucky Derby winner. Right. And so that's, [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1539.72s)]
*  and so see, yeah. So take me back to like, I mean, [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1544.08s)]
*  you had just started racing, right? [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1547.32s)]
*  You'd been racing in or you had just been racing in where in California for a year? [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1550.6399999999999s)]
*  Not even a year. After you won? No, no, no. I mean, I mean, [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1554.8s)]
*  my first Kentucky, I was lucky enough to get my first Kentucky Derby back in 2012. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1558.56s)]
*  And then I was racing in Canada on 2011. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1563.1599999999999s)]
*  The races, the racing season finished in [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1567.52s)]
*  September, October. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1572.48s)]
*  So usually I will come down to San Francisco and ride in San [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1574.12s)]
*  Francisco in the winter. And then, but for whatever reason, [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1578.76s)]
*  they didn't want to give stalls to my Canadian stable that I was with at the [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1582.84s)]
*  time. So they reach out to Santanita and Santanita was like, yeah, [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1587.84s)]
*  we'll give you some stables so you can run here your horses. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1591.44s)]
*  So that's how I ended up in LA, you know, in Santanita in late 2011. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1595.48s)]
*  So that was your first time getting to Los Angeles? [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1602.36s)]
*  To Los Angeles. Yeah. And then that was like, yeah, October, November, [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1604.32s)]
*  December, January, and four months. Then I was, I was, uh, [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1609.16s)]
*  I got introduced to all have another, which went and won the Kentucky Derby. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1613.4s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. You won twice, right? [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1618.32s)]
*  He won the Kentucky and then he won the Pringness. Yeah. But you won. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1621.16s)]
*  I won the, yeah, I won 2011, 2012 and then 2016. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1624.72s)]
*  So was there like a, is there like a rookie year for riders? [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1630.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Apprentice. We call, we call, [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1634.56s)]
*  we are called Apprentice when we are, uh, our first year, uh, [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1636.64s)]
*  when they, we get the license to be a professional rider. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1641.32s)]
*  Then our first year we call Apprentice and then with that does, [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1644.16s)]
*  we are allowed to raise 10 pounds lighter than the professional [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1647.32s)]
*  jockey. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1651.96s)]
*  So for professional jockey is what? 118? [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1653.28s)]
*  118. Then you get, you're allowed to run your horse with 108. You know, [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1656.16s)]
*  you could ride on 108. I can't no anymore. I used to. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1659.76s)]
*  You didn't even chew gum. I feel like. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1664.0s)]
*  Yeah. No, I can't anymore. I used to when I was 18 years old. Yeah. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1665.44s)]
*  Oh, so what phases, what phases a jockey out of the job? [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1669.44s)]
*  Well, I think that's like fighters, you know, like your, um, [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1674.68s)]

*  unfortunate accident that can end your career at any moment. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1682.2s)]
*  Does that happen sometimes? I mean, any moment. Yeah. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1686.2s)]
*  A little M Night Shyamalan there. Does it, uh, and does it happen? [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1688.8799999999999s)]
*  Does that happen? Sorry. I have so many questions right now. It's okay. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1693.12s)]
*  Okay, cool. So, uh, does that, yeah, [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1697.04s)]
*  take me through some of the dangers. What is some of that danger? [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1700.56s)]
*  Like if you have a, like, is it like a, like a, how can you get hurt? [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1703.24s)]
*  How can you get, I mean, you can get thrown off of the horse. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1707.12s)]
*  That's probably the biggest fear. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1710.12s)]
*  Yeah, that's probably the biggest fear. Uh, uh, the biggest fear for me, [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1711.32s)]
*  it's probably like getting, getting thrown off of a horse. If I'm like in the, [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1716.04s)]
*  in the first and the front runners, because then you have, you know, [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1720.56s)]
*  for sure you have people coming behind you, you know, and like I say, [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1724.56s)]
*  these are like total 200 pound animals and then bad drivers. Yeah. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1727.8s)]
*  You don't want, you don't want none of them to catch you midair or like on the [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1731.88s)]
*  floor. Yeah, that's probably. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1735.96s)]
*  So that's almost one of the scary parts I bet about taking the lead is that it's [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1737.72s)]
*  somewhere in your head. You're like, now if something bad happens, [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1741.2s)]
*  all these horses are going to come up behind. Yeah. But you don't think, [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1743.96s)]
*  I think like the moment that you start, that you had those thoughts, [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1746.3600000000001s)]
*  that's probably a good, a good time to retire. Oh yeah. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1749.56s)]
*  If you're like going in the front and you're thinking about, Oh my God, [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1752.72s)]
*  you know, like, yeah, no, you should be focusing on how to win the race. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1755.24s)]
*  Yeah. I think the moment you start having those type of thoughts, [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1760.0s)]
*  I think you should call it quits. That would be me. I'd be like, [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1762.28s)]
*  you guys go on ahead. Uh, how ex, how, okay. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1764.72s)]
*  So you get into the paddock you get, or you get into the gate, right? [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1769.52s)]
*  Is that what it's called? After the warmup. Yeah. The gate that we're at. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1773.84s)]
*  After the warmup, you guys, because yeah, [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1775.72s)]
*  I'm always wondering whenever I'm there betting or whatever, I'm like, Jesus, [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1777.16s)]
*  what are the things for them? [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1780.32s)]
*  One guy and then the guy in the pink hat comes out. I'm like, [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1782.32s)]
*  why is the guy wearing a pink? I don't even know what's going on. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1784.96s)]
*  I feel like it's a gender reveal, [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1787.32s)]
*  but then finally they get everybody lined up. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1789.76s)]
*  Is it easier to be the first horse that gets lined up in there or the last horse [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1793.28s)]
*  or does it even matter? [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1797.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think it does matter. I particularly would like to like, um, [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1799.04s)]
*  lone last, but you don't always, but we don't choose that. It's like, [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1803.2s)]
*  it's like whoever number you have is by numbers or whoever it is. Like, you know, [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1807.6399999999999s)]
*  if you have the seven, eight, nine, 10, you know, they're probably, [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1810.96s)]
*  you're probably going to be, um, put on the gate last. Right. So I prefer that, [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1813.76s)]
*  you know, because then my horse doesn't have too much time to think inside the [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1818.76s)]
*  gate. It's just basically go ready, go. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1822.56s)]
*  Yeah. And so once your horse is in the gate, what are you doing in there? [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1825.04s)]
*  Like, um, I see you brought a, is this a saddle? Yeah, the saddle. Yeah. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1829.64s)]
*  That's what we used to ride them. Can I pick it up? Yeah, you can pick it up. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1833.92s)]
*  This is the lingerie of saddles. Huh? My God. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1839.3600000000001s)]
*  Japanese saddle. Is it? Yeah. Wow. Shout out to Japan. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1843.8s)]
*  Yeah. Shout out to Japan, dude. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1848.1200000000001s)]
*  Very ironic that they are have a driving instrument [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1849.56s)]
*  together. No shade, but that's wild. So how does this even, [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1855.08s)]
*  I know, right? I think I'd just rather wear a thick underpants. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1860.64s)]
*  This is so small. So this goes towards the front of the horse and you, [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1864.1200000000001s)]
*  uh, and what is this? What is this? [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1869.8s)]
*  Oh my gosh. And this is yours. MG right here. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1875.76s)]
*  Oh, that's cool, man. Um, [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1881.28s)]
*  so, and this is about as, this is a pretty commonplace, uh, [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1885.04s)]
*  saddle. Yeah, that would probably like most of, yeah, unless you go like, [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1890.28s)]
*  there is a little bit bigger saddles and they actually way smaller saddles. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1894.52s)]
*  There's a probably like midsize saddle, you know, there is like, [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1898.76s)]
*  there is some saddles are probably like weigh one pound for like people like [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1902.72s)]
*  jokies, the struggle with weight. Oh, really? [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1906.72s)]
*  They're basically just stirrups and that little tiny thing. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1910.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Honestly, like it probably is like this big. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1914.3600000000001s)]
*  Some chubby jockey rolls. Yeah. Like, [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1918.8000000000002s)]
*  okay. And so this hooks into the belts that go under the horse. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1922.72s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Like it's like a, like a, like elastic band, you know, [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1925.64s)]
*  we call them gerts, you know that. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1928.88s)]
*  Okay. So you're out there, you get on the, you have the saddle, [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1930.8400000000001s)]
*  you're on the horse and you're in the gate. And then what happens, [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1933.64s)]
*  what are you doing while you're in the gate to keep the horse ready to race? [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1936.3200000000002s)]
*  We just try to, to, um, uh, your best and to like, just have a, [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1939.36s)]
*  we have another person that is kind of like helping you manage the whole while [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1943.76s)]
*  you're in the gate. And this happened more than maybe like 15 seconds, [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1946.9199999999998s)]
*  you're in the gate, you know, 20 seconds, 25 seconds, the most, you know, [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1950.9599999999998s)]
*  so for them time you have a person kind of helping you control the horse and [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1953.8s)]
*  kind of like make sure he's looking forward. Just like a rodeo, [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1957.36s)]
*  almost like a rodeo when they're getting on the bull, something like that, [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1961.1999999999998s)]
*  you know, and then, um, hold on and wait till, [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1963.6s)]
*  wait till the, that they get open and then it's go time. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1966.96s)]
*  Liquid death. You know, the summer gets the most out of you. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1978.0s)]
*  Physically it drains you. It'll suck the water out of purge it, [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1983.48s)]
*  get it out of your skin, out of your body, out of your arms and legs. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1987.6399999999999s)]
*  It'll get you. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=1990.6399999999999s)]

*  They know to go and then sometimes you have to encourage them, you know, [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2151.8s)]
*  and then then whoever the plan, whoever whatever the plan was with the with the trainer, [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2155.2000000000003s)]

*  And all of a sudden you kind of go like and it's just like [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2309.48s)]
*  you feel the push, the push kind of shifting gears in a car. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2313.1600000000003s)]
*  You feel that, OK, I have it. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2316.88s)]
*  So you can like you eat up on him and be like, OK, don't worry. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2318.0800000000004s)]

*  Yeah. Yeah. OK. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2323.72s)]
*  Then sometimes you're asking the horse and he goes nowhere [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2325.3999999999996s)]
*  and he's like, oh, it's going to be a rough trip. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2327.9199999999996s)]
*  He's like looking at the concession. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2331.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, basically. Yeah. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2333.7599999999998s)]
*  Is there a way to to turn around, say a horse kind of feels like it's not into it [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2336.24s)]
*  or it's gassed out or it's not having that flair in that race? [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2340.9199999999996s)]
*  Is there a way to recalibrate that kind of force? [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2345.0s)]
*  Or is it just kind of like sometimes that's just the way that it rolls? [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2348.52s)]
*  There's like horses, right? [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2353.0s)]
*  It's a living creature. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2355.2799999999997s)]
*  So like, no, like in that and that is nothing you can do in there [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2356.16s)]
*  to to to shift that, you know, when a horse can give you it all the year, [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2360.04s)]
*  when when a fire is tired, there's no way you can pump air into him. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2363.24s)]
*  And all of a sudden, the [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2367.04s)]
*  wouldn't that be great if they brought a pump out? [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2369.3999999999996s)]
*  All right. So I know like basically you. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2371.0s)]
*  I mean, it's our responsibility to kind of like wrap up, you know, save him, [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2374.08s)]
*  you know, and right, save him. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2377.7999999999997s)]
*  So then you're thinking about a chance for him to run a few weeks from now. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2379.56s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. You know, regroup, you know, like maybe he wasn't feeling good [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2382.84s)]

*  It's just not feeling it, you know, like, oh, he is about to get sick, you know? [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2393.88s)]
*  You know, sometimes when we are about to get a cold, you know, like you can feel it, [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2399.16s)]
*  you know, two, three days before that, you're going to feel a little bit. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2402.6s)]

*  OK, so let's stop when we get to that. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2504.16s)]
*  But we know this is in Bodemeister is down on the inside. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2505.96s)]
*  Why can't we get to see Triniberg, [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2508.24s)]

*  So what's kind of going on right here? [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2517.3199999999997s)]
*  Like horses are coming out, some of them, I guess, [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2519.72s)]
*  like are some of the like some of the riders are in the lead here. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2523.12s)]
*  Like, yeah, is that because the the the jockey has like kind of commanded [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2526.16s)]
*  them to be in the lead or did the horse just come out strong? [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2530.3599999999997s)]
*  No, a lot of horses are like being command to go to the lead, you know, [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2532.92s)]
*  and everybody is trying to be. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2535.7599999999998s)]
*  It's like not necessarily that you want to go to the lead, [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2539.2s)]
*  but you want to get a clear path so you can be like maybe like to be in front of [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2541.2s)]
*  a horse, whatever horse is behind you, because that way [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2545.88s)]
*  you can get your position faster, you know. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2549.08s)]
*  OK, and now if a horse comes up, say you come out of the gate [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2552.56s)]
*  and another horse kind of gets in front of you a little bit. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2556.12s)]
*  Is that bad for your horse? [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2558.56s)]
*  Yeah, because then you had to you had to regroup. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2560.0s)]
*  You have to you have to check your horse. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2562.2s)]
*  Now you have to wait whatever that the horse in front of you is going to do. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2563.84s)]
*  And then you hop in there after that, then you get to do, you know, your [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2567.04s)]
*  your strategy or basically choose plan B or plan C. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2571.32s)]
*  You know, now you're there. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2575.32s)]
*  Now it's just what you do. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2576.36s)]
*  You know, you chose to stay there or you chose to go around [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2577.44s)]
*  that horse in front of you is just a lot like you have to adjust in the moment. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2581.08s)]
*  Is there a moment there's a horse here that's in the back [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2586.32s)]
*  and he's only in the back by about three lengths, it looks like. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2588.44s)]
*  And is that right? You think how many links has he been in the back? [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2591.56s)]
*  Yeah, he's probably like around six, seven links. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2594.88s)]
*  My length man is what he used to be. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2598.56s)]
*  I was just trying to sound like I knew what I was saying, but [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2601.08s)]
*  so he's about six or seven links back. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2603.32s)]
*  Does that horse he still has a chance to win, though? [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2606.12s)]
*  Huh? Of course. Yeah, no, of course. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2608.4s)]
*  Yes. Unless that horse [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2609.96s)]
*  is tragedy or or or [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2614.52s)]
*  was to going to the front, you know, to the front. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2617.7999999999997s)]
*  If that wasn't if that was the case, then he's totally screwed. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2620.2799999999997s)]
*  He's like not liking his chances. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2624.2s)]
*  And the jockeys realizing at that point, [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2626.7999999999997s)]
*  oh, this is probably not going to be the day. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2628.44s)]
*  Not going to be good. Yeah. OK. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2630.04s)]
*  OK, cool. Let's let's keep it cruising then. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2631.84s)]
*  And where are you at right here? [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2633.92s)]
*  On the outside. Oh, there you are cruising, huh? [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2635.88s)]
*  Yeah. And now Bodemeister's ahead of Triniberg. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2638.04s)]
*  You're kind of in the middle right now, right? [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2640.88s)]
*  I'm in the middle. Yeah, the purple helmet. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2642.52s)]
*  I'm in the middle. I'm going to bounce a little bit. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2644.04s)]
*  I think there's some gas in it. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2645.8s)]
*  Oh, Hanson's hard to control early. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2647.76s)]
*  Jemala just is fifth on the outside. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2649.4s)]
*  I'll have another is next. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2651.04s)]
*  OK, so we'll stop it up here next. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2652.2400000000002s)]
*  So you have turns here. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2654.28s)]
*  Like how much turns do you have? Two. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2655.6s)]
*  Two turns. So you have this one and then coming out of it? [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2657.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2660.08s)]
*  Now, what do you think is the biggest difference [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2661.08s)]
*  now? What do you do during the turns, man? [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2663.3999999999996s)]
*  Well, you try to save as much. Yeah. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2665.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, because you can't do much. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2668.16s)]
*  Even if you're playing a racing game or something like on the turn, [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2669.56s)]
*  you're like, slow down a little bit. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2672.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, you just have to like be in the turn. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2673.7999999999997s)]
*  There's not you can't. I feel like it's hard to use strategy. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2675.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, no, you have to. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2677.9599999999996s)]
*  You just have to help your horse to take the turn the best way possible, [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2678.9199999999996s)]
*  you know, and then like set up your [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2682.2799999999997s)]
*  coming out of out of this first turn [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2685.7999999999997s)]
*  because you're going to get a stretch again, you know. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2688.4399999999996s)]
*  OK. And then line up to get the second. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2690.3999999999996s)]
*  The last turn, you know. OK. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2692.64s)]
*  OK, let's keep it cruising here. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2695.32s)]
*  The rail will take charge in D as they move into the turn [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2696.88s)]
*  and that it's daddy knows best on the far outside liaison [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2699.7599999999998s)]
*  creative cause optimizer along the rail. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2702.84s)]
*  Now, do you feel like you had a chance in this race right here? [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2705.32s)]
*  What were you feeling like? [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2708.32s)]
*  I did that. I have a chance because this is a horse that I like. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2709.4s)]
*  I was I got very familiar with him before going to the Kentucky Derby. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2712.44s)]
*  And you have to understand, like, this never happened to. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2716.32s)]
*  They now happens to nobody. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2718.64s)]
*  All of a sudden, a kid coming from a C [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2719.88s)]
*  race track or D racetrack, you know, like, and all of a sudden, [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2723.6s)]
*  he is in the Kentucky there. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2727.2000000000003s)]
*  But first of all, it was a lot of doubts. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2728.6800000000003s)]
*  It's like, you know, like, well, is he even have it? [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2730.2000000000003s)]
*  You know, is it really that can he be good enough to be in this type of race? [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2733.0s)]
*  Does he even have his adult teeth? [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2736.7200000000003s)]
*  I'm sure a lot of people are wondering, you know, like a lot of. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2738.12s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, they're probably thinking, oh, he's totally going to melt down, [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2740.44s)]
*  you know, things like that. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2743.12s)]
*  Oh, the pressure and all these things. Was there a lot of pressure? No. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2744.4s)]
*  I'm very lucky that I don't the pressure. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2748.48s)]
*  I am very good on the pressure, you know, and I couldn't. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2750.84s)]
*  I couldn't like commit. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2755.0s)]
*  And you're in fourth right here. Yeah, I'm four right now. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2756.8s)]
*  So this is the second turn to the second turn. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2759.28s)]
*  I thought I was going to finish second. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2762.04s)]
*  If you see that horse in front, OK, is like super, super in front of me. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2764.28s)]
*  Oh, totally. And then but I might still have some gas. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2768.7599999999998s)]
*  I'm thinking like, oh, my God, you know, I'm going to finish second. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2771.32s)]
*  And they can talk to that. I was. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2774.04s)]
*  I was so pumped. Right here. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2776.72s)]
*  OK, what do you do on the horse here? [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2779.04s)]
*  So you have now you we also have I just want to show this here. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2781.0s)]
*  This is called a what? [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2783.96s)]
*  We crop. OK, whip or crop. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2785.72s)]
*  And then we have your helmet here. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2788.24s)]
*  OK, and so that's pretty like the everybody wears kind of the same type of helmet. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2791.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah. OK. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2794.68s)]
*  Do you now at this point, how much times can you whip the horse as much as you want? [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2796.08s)]
*  This? Yeah. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2801.7599999999998s)]
*  But a lot of rules have changed now. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2804.12s)]
*  Now we're not allowed, you know, but I'm never like [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2806.7999999999997s)]
*  known to hear my horse a lot, you know. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2813.08s)]
*  So if you see here, I hear once and then you push your horse, [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2815.08s)]
*  you know, you had to give him a chance to respond, you know. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2818.0s)]
*  But but back in 2012, there wasn't like a restriction [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2820.3599999999997s)]
*  on how many times you can whip a horse. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2825.04s)]
*  It was like a stepdad out there. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2826.92s)]
*  If you want, you could have gone like that. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2828.56s)]
*  Like, you know, but does the horse does it hurt the horse much? [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2830.64s)]
*  It doesn't. What do you think? [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2833.44s)]
*  Well, it depends. I think back in the days, it used to. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2836.2400000000002s)]
*  If I if I show you one of the the the the [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2838.36s)]
*  whips that they used to use, the old timers, you know, [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2842.4s)]
*  really, they used to use them seriously. Yeah. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2845.16s)]
*  Yeah, that's interesting. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2848.92s)]
*  It's not as like I mean, if this were led, it would be tough. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2850.12s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2853.0s)]
*  OK, so here we go. Let's go through this, man. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2855.8s)]
*  This is crazy. So what is your strategy right here? [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2858.0s)]
*  Like, do you have any? Well, no, that does it. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2859.56s)]
*  Like as soon as you go to the last stretch, [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2861.16s)]
*  that's just like try to go as far as like try to ask your horse to finish. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2862.92s)]
*  Like, are you yelling at the horse? Yeah. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2867.44s)]
*  What do you say? Come on. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2869.7599999999998s)]
*  Come on. Yeah. Come on. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2871.44s)]

*  Yeah, that was so cool. Yeah. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2893.6s)]
*  Then that. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2895.84s)]
*  Well, I guess like, you know, like you say, compared that's like our Super Bowl, [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2897.44s)]
*  you know, like so my whole life, I was 24 years old, I think. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2900.2s)]
*  I'm also my whole life like just flash in front of me, you know, thinking that [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2903.56s)]
*  maybe this is why I don't watch this replay, [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2908.2s)]
*  because then I get emotional a little bit. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2910.16s)]
*  Dude, I'm emotional even in it. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2912.96s)]
*  I mean, I've done steroids, but that's the closest I've come. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2914.6s)]
*  I used to do it in high school, the closest I've come to being in the Kentucky. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=2917.4s)]

*  And yeah, there's probably like seven girls being jokeys in Mexico city. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4329.08s)]

*  Dude, put Nick on a horse and put me on a rehab. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4337.64s)]
*  I'll see, I'll see when I come in. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4344.04s)]
*  So yeah, that's how I ended up in Canada with no money. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4348.12s)]
*  I took, I don't know. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4352.92s)]
*  I think I took like 10,000 pesos and my goal was like, with this 10,000 pesos, [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4354.52s)]
*  I'm, I'm going to exchange for Canadian money. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4361.72s)]
*  And then I, I, I was supposed to have an agent. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4365.24s)]
*  I supposed to have a place to stay and I supposed to have a car, how to travel around. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4368.04s)]
*  Right. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4372.679999999999s)]
*  That is what they offer me. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4373.08s)]
*  This is what they told me. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4374.28s)]
*  About 500 bucks you had. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4375.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4377.08s)]
*  Well, when I got there, I, I, I, I exchanged all my money. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4377.32s)]
*  I think I got like 400, 450 back in the day, you know, something like that. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4381.4s)]
*  I don't know, but no more than 400. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4385.08s)]
*  So, um, there is like, uh, no agent, there is no place to stay. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4388.759999999999s)]
*  So they go and they put me in this hotel, very close to the racetrack. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4393.8s)]
*  Now I know it's very close. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4398.12s)]
*  I didn't even know where the racetrack was back, back in the States, you know, [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4399.16s)]
*  and I had to pay for my own hotel. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4402.4400000000005s)]
*  Right. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4404.2s)]
*  So I stayed there three nights and all my money, they basically, I just [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4404.92s)]
*  spend my money and the hotel. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4409.16s)]
*  And then I, um, I had no food. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4411.8s)]
*  I don't speak English. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4415.08s)]
*  I basically was living on like on chips from a vending machine. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4416.84s)]
*  Somehow I knew what a vending machine was. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4421.0s)]
*  Chips wasn't you remember potato chips and like some other type of chips. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4423.639999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4428.44s)]
*  I was drinking water. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4429.16s)]
*  I do. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4430.2s)]
*  If I do a vending machine, I do Fritos. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4430.76s)]
*  I don't even think Fritos were in Canada back in those back in. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4433.0s)]
*  They might not have been, you know what? [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4435.719999999999s)]
*  You can be right about that. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4437.0s)]
*  So I was starving for three days. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4437.719999999999s)]
*  Couldn't, but that helps your weight, dude. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4440.679999999999s)]
*  So did you get on a horse? [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4442.5199999999995s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4445.32s)]
*  So I was like, God damn it. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4445.639999999999s)]
*  Nine pounds, 10 ounces on a horse. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4447.719999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4449.88s)]
*  This is really funny because finally my agent shows up and now he's [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4451.18s)]
*  taking me to the racetrack. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4454.7s)]
*  Right. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4455.900000000001s)]
*  Oh, that's exactly what now this is a typical agent. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4456.46s)]
*  That's just like Hollywood. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4459.18s)]
*  They show up just when it's time for you to try and make some money. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4460.14s)]
*  Okay. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4462.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4463.34s)]

*  And when I look at the racetrack, I was like, I'm used to Mexico city run [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4468.46s)]
*  right in a mile racetrack, you know, mile. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4474.46s)]
*  This racetrack is five footlands. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4477.18s)]
*  It's like compared to a mile racetrack. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4479.66s)]
*  Now you were like in a very tiny circle and I was like, Oh, this is a racetrack. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4481.66s)]
*  I'm like, Jesus, what am I doing here? [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4487.1s)]
*  You know? [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4489.42s)]

*  I, and right then in my head, I made my plan. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4491.5s)]
*  I was like, no, I'm going to ride one week. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4493.9s)]
*  If I win, whatever I win by my ticket, I'm going back. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4495.66s)]
*  I'm out of here. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4499.42s)]
*  I'm not going to stay here. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4499.98s)]
*  You know? [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4500.94s)]
*  So that will happen. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4501.58s)]
*  I wrote there the first week. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4502.38s)]
*  I won like four races, something like that, you know? [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4504.54s)]

*  Canada is still closed from COVID. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4592.86s)]
*  Has Mexico been closed from COVID? [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4594.54s)]
*  I don't think they never really closed. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4596.54s)]
*  I don't think they never really closed. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4597.98s)]
*  America, it's the biggest bunch of bull. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4599.42s)]
*  I feel like it's such a biggest bullshit that they put in there. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4601.0199999999995s)]
*  I used to have those talks when this COVID began, you know, because I was like, I was, [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4602.86s)]
*  I think everybody was really falling in a lot. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4606.7s)]
*  And I was falling in a lot. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4608.94s)]
*  What's happening in Mexico. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4609.82s)]
*  And I hear like the new president talk and how he was like, you know, [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4611.0199999999995s)]
*  his explanation for this virus and everything like that. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4616.14s)]
*  And there's his reason why he wouldn't close the border. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4618.94s)]
*  People will be some restriction, but he will not close the borders, you know? [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4623.1s)]
*  And then I was like, why can't United States do this? [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4627.26s)]
*  And even my wife was like, you know, this president doesn't know what he's doing. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4630.38s)]
*  You know, he's going to like it because the health care system in Mexico is not the same. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4634.46s)]
*  It's not the same as here, right? [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4638.86s)]
*  So I was like, well, we'll see. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4640.54s)]
*  We'll see, right? [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4642.3s)]
*  And it's fine. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4643.5s)]
*  It's fine. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4644.38s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4645.42s)]
*  It's unbelievable, man, what they did. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4647.1s)]
*  You can even see it here. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4648.78s)]
*  Like you look Florida, you look Texas. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4649.74s)]
*  Or even California, you know, like how many, you know, we went like super crazy, [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4652.7s)]
*  shut everything down. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4659.98s)]
*  Now that everything is going back to normal, you know. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4661.42s)]
*  Everything's fine. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4665.58s)]
*  Everything is fine, you know. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4666.3s)]
*  Yeah. And it's weird. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4667.9s)]
*  Everything just suddenly back and everything doesn't make any sense. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4668.46s)]
*  Yeah. It's like nothing really changed, right? [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4669.9s)]
*  Like even in our job now, like going into the Elmer season in San Diego, [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4671.98s)]
*  now there it seems that it's going to, yeah, it's nice. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4677.74s)]
*  But now for us in this regard into COVID, it's almost like now they say they're [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4680.54s)]
*  not forcing us to get the vaccine, but they really are because now it's like, [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4685.26s)]
*  if I want to go and do my normal training in the mornings, I have to be vaccinated. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4691.82s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4697.0199999999995s)]
*  Otherwise I'm not going to be allowed to go in the mornings and train. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4697.82s)]
*  I'm going to be allowed to race, but I need to be in a separate room. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4700.7s)]
*  And to me, look, I'm not educated, highly educated or anything, but to me it's like, [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4705.18s)]
*  we're all the same family. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4710.94s)]
*  We're riding here in Santa Anita. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4712.38s)]
*  Nobody's getting tested. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4714.46s)]
*  What's different for right now? [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4715.5s)]
*  Why is it going to have to be so strict in Elmer than what it is right now? [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4717.34s)]
*  But now those are the rules and we need to apply to the rules. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4722.22s)]
*  It's the same thing. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4726.46s)]
*  This guy, Cole Beasley, who plays for, I think, Buffalo now, [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4727.1s)]
*  he just said the same thing that he's a wide receiver for NFL, for American football. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4730.94s)]
*  And he has to, he doesn't want to get vaccinated, but now he has to like practice separate. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4736.46s)]
*  It's just ridiculous. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4741.66s)]
*  But why? [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4742.54s)]
*  He can play, but he's still allowed to play in the game. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4743.66s)]
*  I know. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4745.66s)]
*  It's just crazy. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4746.86s)]
*  It's like right now, right now I'm allowed to go in the mornings, do my, and we're not testing. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4747.58s)]
*  You know, we're still, we're not doing anything, you know, you know, even the restaurants, [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4752.86s)]
*  you know, why can't you just, if everything is open now, I think they're going to have [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4758.22s)]
*  a little bit of restrictions. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4761.66s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4763.02s)]
*  Well, it's just, it's also crazy. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4763.58s)]
*  Like the mask man, he's lifted in LA, right? [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4764.94s)]
*  Also in Tennessee. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4769.1s)]
*  But if you're on an airplane, you have to have a mask on in between. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4770.38s)]
*  It's like for what? [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4774.7s)]
*  And also the whole time, like, so I've been living in Tennessee a lot during the pandemic [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4775.66s)]
*  and like everyone in Florida isn't dead. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4779.42s)]
*  Everyone in Tennessee actually has been having a great time. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4781.26s)]
*  And it's just, I don't know. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4784.46s)]
*  It doesn't really make any sense. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4786.78s)]
*  You could say whatever you want about the science, but even the, if you test the science in reality, [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4788.14s)]
*  which is how you create science with hypothesis, certainly huge cities, not getting sick. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4793.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4800.62s)]
*  Has to be a valid test. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4801.18s)]
*  Yeah, no, definitely. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4803.18s)]
*  But it's amazing that Mexico didn't even shut down. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4804.38s)]
*  I knew that. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4806.38s)]
*  I knew they didn't. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4807.66s)]
*  Well, I hear it myself. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4808.860000000001s)]
*  Like I've been to Mexico. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4810.06s)]
*  I've been to like. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4811.5s)]
*  There were some restrictions, but there was like, but you were allowed, you were still [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4812.38s)]
*  allowed to go to, to, to cross the border and go and I'm sure there's still restaurants [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4815.740000000001s)]
*  and things like that. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4821.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4822.38s)]
*  People who go to. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4823.5s)]
*  I was thinking I've been in Africa a couple of times. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4824.860000000001s)]
*  Like I'm like, you telling me that they wander through Africa and got masks on everyone in [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4826.14s)]
*  Africa. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4831.02s)]
*  You're out of your mind. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4831.58s)]
*  It just all seemed kind of crazy. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4834.62s)]
*  Let's get into a couple more questions. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4837.34s)]
*  We have one right here that came in from these two. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4838.46s)]
*  Well, here we go right here. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4840.46s)]
*  What are these called? [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4841.5s)]
*  These track rack, track tricks. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4842.14s)]
*  I don't know what you call them. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4847.1s)]
*  Track rats, beautiful ladies. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4847.9800000000005s)]
*  I'm going to call them. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4849.740000000001s)]
*  Hey, we just had a quick question. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4850.38s)]
*  We're from and we were just trying to figure out where all the rich horse trainers and [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4856.46s)]
*  owners hang out at bars or restaurants or golf courses that we should start going to [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4860.38s)]
*  and feel we'll see you September 18th to celebrate my best friend's 21st birthday in [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4869.34s)]
*  Cincinnati. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4874.22s)]
*  Oh, congratulations. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4875.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4876.78s)]
*  The Cincinnati show is going to be great, man. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4877.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4881.820000000001s)]
*  I guess these ladies are looking to meet some of the owners. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4882.06s)]
*  How do they somehow manage to get into sweets and ready? [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4884.06s)]
*  Like I say, they're people that own the horses. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4889.660000000001s)]
*  They're like, they're, you know, like, they're different level. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4893.820000000001s)]
*  Actually, but now there is like something called popular. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4898.22s)]
*  They're doing like these syndicates, you know, like when there's a group of people, [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4900.9400000000005s)]
*  there is a guys, there is a couple guys that are doing it here in Santa Anita, too, [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4905.26s)]
*  where it's like there's two guys. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4908.7s)]
*  They get a bunch of people chipping a little bit of money and then they own like small [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4910.22s)]
*  pieces of a horse, you know, and then interesting. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4914.54s)]
*  Could do just like buy a horse that is already he can afford a horse, but that's already [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4918.06s)]
*  like, I don't know about that. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4923.74s)]
*  I'll tell you this. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4924.62s)]
*  If I can, I'll tell you what horse it is. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4925.1s)]
*  It's named Tom Thumb and I met him one time at the Pasadena Fair. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4926.860000000001s)]
*  And it's the world's you get to name your horse whatever you want. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4929.5s)]
*  Really? [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4931.74s)]
*  Actually, you just have to, you have to, what is it? [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4932.06s)]
*  Like there is, we have some type of, oh, you have to send the name, send the name [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4936.38s)]
*  through a company and then they will give you the okay. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4940.46s)]
*  But there is a bunch of little tricks that you can, you can do. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4942.620000000001s)]
*  So, but could Theo just buy one that's already like trained and ready to go and then have [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4946.06s)]
*  you as this rider? [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4950.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah, there is different. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4952.22s)]
*  That's, that's like I said, that's a really complicated to explain that because we have [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4953.34s)]
*  like all type of races, like in a whole car. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4956.780000000001s)]
*  If I can show you up, you know, we have what he calls claiming racing. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4959.02s)]
*  Okay. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4962.700000000001s)]
*  And then I think the lowest we have here in Santa Anita is like 25. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4963.18s)]
*  This is the horse I met right here and it's Tom Thumb. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4969.02s)]
*  This is him right there. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4972.38s)]
*  He is so tiny. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4973.42s)]
*  You may want to take him home. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4974.3s)]
*  That's a little four legged superhero right there. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4975.34s)]
*  How long are you going to be here today for? [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4979.26s)]
*  He'll be here all day. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4982.780000000001s)]
*  How small is he? [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4983.580000000001s)]
*  Dang boy. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4989.9800000000005s)]
*  He's so small baby. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4990.9400000000005s)]
*  He's so small. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4993.34s)]
*  And he's alive too. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4994.14s)]
*  You gotta give him a great. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=4996.860000000001s)]
*  So, so someone can buy, say how does someone get in a claiming race? [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5000.620000000001s)]
*  What is that? [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5003.740000000001s)]
*  Oh, but that's kind of like the low level, level races, you know, horses, they can not [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5004.22s)]
*  compete in a lounge race, you know, they're like, they're a little bit lesser, you know, [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5008.22s)]
*  that you, you try to put them where they can win, you know, so you, you don't want to break [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5011.9800000000005s)]
*  the horse car, you know? [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5016.46s)]
*  So you kind of had to first find where his level at and then raise them there so he can [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5017.5s)]
*  be competitive, you know? [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5022.62s)]
*  So there is, I think it's 20 some thousand dollars, the cheapest we have here, maybe, [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5023.98s)]
*  maybe a little bit cheaper. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5028.62s)]
*  And then, uh, so you just contact your trainer or a trainer there and say, hey, I'm so and so, [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5030.46s)]
*  and I want to claim a horse and you can claim that. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5037.9s)]
*  And put him in the race? [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5039.98s)]
*  Well, you had to do this. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5042.14s)]
*  You had to do that while he's racing. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5044.06s)]
*  So after the race, it's yours. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5045.58s)]
*  Now, if you put the claim in before, before he's going to race, right? [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5050.54s)]
*  So now if the claim goes through, that means the horse, nothing happens to the horse, the [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5054.94s)]
*  horse clears the veterinarian and everything, because they want to make sure that the new [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5060.0599999999995s)]
*  owner gets a sound horse, you know? [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5063.82s)]
*  Okay. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5066.22s)]
*  So because you already put the claim and the horse came back from the race, good. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5066.62s)]
*  Now, it's yours. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5070.54s)]
*  Really? You just pick him up? [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5072.38s)]
*  That's it. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5073.26s)]
*  You just pick him up and call your trainer and get him going on. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5073.66s)]
*  Get him going. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5078.22s)]
*  Dang. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5078.78s)]
*  That's how you do it. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5079.099999999999s)]
*  That's what I say. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5080.54s)]
*  You can own a horse. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5081.0199999999995s)]
*  We could do it. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5081.82s)]
*  We have room here. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5082.22s)]
*  I think maybe I would name it. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5082.94s)]
*  I have one horse actually, Brendan, that we keep back here sometimes, but, um, that's a [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5084.86s)]
*  different show. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5088.7s)]
*  He eats kratom and nicotine. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5089.42s)]
*  Yeah, he does. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5090.78s)]
*  He's definitely, he's on a unique diet. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5092.139999999999s)]
*  What are the fitness things that you do fitness wise to stay in shape, man? [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5095.58s)]
*  I train boxing. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5099.42s)]
*  You do? [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5100.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5100.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5101.98s)]
*  I train boxing. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5102.22s)]
*  Just because that's the, that's what I love. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5103.1s)]
*  Right. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5105.34s)]
*  And then, uh, that's the only thing that I can, I'm actually excited to go and do, you [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5105.740000000001s)]
*  know, I try do the normal, uh, training, you know, the cardio and ways and these things, [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5111.26s)]
*  but it's just like, it's not exciting for me, you know, but I go boxing and gets me [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5116.780000000001s)]
*  the cardio, give me the strength or something. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5121.5s)]
*  And are there other exercises that they ask that, that, that help you be a jockey or is [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5123.900000000001s)]
*  it just about kind of keeping your weight down? [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5128.14s)]
*  Keeping your weight down. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5129.820000000001s)]
*  You have, well, we got, we, we write, like I said, [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5130.700000000001s)]
*  we train a lot of horses during the week. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5132.94s)]
*  So that kind of, we get our fitness somehow from there too. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5134.78s)]
*  Like, um, um, we can do some type of, a lot of squats, you know, a lot of leg work, you [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5137.82s)]
*  know, our legs need to be strong or core, our arm. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5142.46s)]
*  Cause the position you're in, can you bring that up, Nick? [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5146.299999999999s)]
*  Do you mind? [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5148.0599999999995s)]
*  Just hit when he's on a horse. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5148.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5150.299999999999s)]
*  Cause you're real, I mean, you're in there. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5152.0599999999995s)]
*  The goal is to stay as small as possible. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5153.339999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5155.259999999999s)]
*  I already know. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5155.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5156.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5156.94s)]
*  And is there a certain, like a nu, like a nucleus point on the horse you want to stay [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5157.82s)]
*  on top of kind of in the center? [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5162.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5164.38s)]
*  Okay. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5164.7s)]
*  Wow, man. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5168.46s)]
*  And some do, do, can now, can a little person like a, or they used to call midget, [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5170.62s)]
*  but a little person, can they be a jockey or no? [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5175.42s)]
*  They could. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5178.06s)]
*  They, I think that, I think that would be difficult because the arm length, you know, [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5179.02s)]
*  it probably, okay. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5183.02s)]
*  So you have to have more. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5183.66s)]
*  So the arm length is a little bit limited. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5184.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5186.06s)]
*  Or maybe they wouldn't be as strong as, you know, the push would be like. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5186.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5189.9800000000005s)]
*  I'm just curious as to why that, why, why wouldn't more men or women like that be, [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5190.14s)]
*  be, be jockeys. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5195.74s)]
*  And what about a child? [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5196.86s)]
*  Anybody ever try to sneak a child in there? [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5197.9s)]
*  Can a child do it? [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5199.5s)]
*  No, no, you had to be, I think you had to be 16. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5200.3s)]
*  I think it's probably the youngest you can assume. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5205.02s)]
*  Probably 18, but you have to be signed by your parents. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5207.34s)]
*  And so does the horse get excited? [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5212.06s)]
*  Yeah, that guy is going to have a hoot. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5213.9800000000005s)]
*  How's Bula dude? [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5216.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5219.18s)]
*  He could do it, man. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5219.5s)]
*  Yeah, no. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5220.46s)]
*  I would like to see him do it. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5221.82s)]
*  Huh? [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5223.34s)]
*  I think that would be dangerous. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5223.9s)]
*  We did send him down to the Hippodrome. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5225.5s)]
*  Mexico. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5229.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5229.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5229.9s)]
*  We just sent him down to Mexico City, man, and see what happens to him. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5230.22s)]
*  That is funny. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5233.58s)]
*  So the horse gets excited when it wins. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5236.54s)]
*  Does it know, you feel like the horse knows that it won? [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5238.22s)]
*  Oh yeah, I think so. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5240.06s)]
*  I'm not going to tell you every horses, you know, but yeah, they know, they know when they [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5241.42s)]
*  win. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5244.38s)]
*  They even get that probably, you know, because they have a groom, right? [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5244.62s)]
*  The groom is the one that they probably spend the most amount of time with the groom, you [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5247.34s)]
*  know, every single day from super early to super late in the afternoon, you know, so [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5251.42s)]
*  I mean, these grooms love these horses, right? [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5256.06s)]
*  So if their horse win, you know, they probably get the extra carry, the extra. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5259.900000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5264.62s)]
*  They really know everything. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5265.02s)]
*  Everything. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5266.3s)]
*  Bobbing for apples, whatever they want. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5267.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5268.9400000000005s)]
*  Wow. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5270.06s)]
*  I'm trying to think of some of the questions that we had. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5272.06s)]
*  Nick, did anything pop in your head or anything good come in? [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5273.74s)]
*  Here's a question from a beautiful young lady, obviously, and this is from the Dust Bowl [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5275.82s)]
*  era. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5280.62s)]
*  This question, and that's just a joke, ladies, a beautiful kids. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5282.0599999999995s)]
*  And that one kid looks a little bit like, I'm going to say it like, Hasbullah, who just [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5284.78s)]
*  sent in, who we just saw the picture of. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5288.3s)]
*  What's up? [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5292.219999999999s)]
*  Hi, Mario and Mario. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5292.7s)]
*  We are from Saskatoon, Saskatchewan in Canada. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5294.3s)]
*  And we have a question for Mario. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5299.179999999999s)]
*  Our racetrack in town is closing down and they are opening a new one outside of town. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5302.14s)]
*  The First Nation people are going to open it up. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5309.34s)]
*  And I was just wondering if you have any superstitions riding on an old track that's [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5311.5s)]
*  tried and true versus riding on a brand new track. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5317.34s)]
*  Gang gang. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5320.78s)]
*  Gang gang. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5322.14s)]
*  Oh, that's so cute. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5323.74s)]
*  Superstitions. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5326.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5327.34s)]
*  I think we all have little superstitions, you know? [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5327.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5329.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5330.54s)]
*  One of mine, if it's like, let's say like we have big days of racing, big days where [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5331.740000000001s)]
*  like they're expensive races, you know? [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5335.900000000001s)]
*  And if whatever I'm wearing, if I don't have a good day, you know, I never wear that [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5337.820000000001s)]
*  for a big day of racing. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5345.660000000001s)]
*  But I think we all have a little superstition. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5348.3s)]
*  Is there more superstitions you think between Latino riders or any other type of riders? [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5352.38s)]
*  Do you notice one or the other really or no? [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5358.54s)]
*  No, but I really think everybody will have a little bit of something, you know? [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5360.78s)]
*  Like even if it's a saddle, you know, like you don't do this type of thing before you [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5365.1s)]
*  want to race, you know, there is some people, there is a very common thing to say to owners [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5370.22s)]
*  or trainers to say, hey, I see you in the winner's circle. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5375.34s)]
*  And some people hate to say that. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5378.94s)]
*  So they won't say certain things, jinx themselves. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5381.98s)]
*  Jinx themselves and things like that. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5384.46s)]
*  Do you, is there, will you wear socks and stuff during the thing? [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5386.139999999999s)]
*  Like do you wear, what do you wear to keep yourself as light as possible? [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5391.74s)]
*  Well, our equipment is super light. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5394.94s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, this weighs probably all this total probably weighs three pounds. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5397.82s)]
*  So probably like our pants, socks, vest and undershirt alone is probably like only two pounds. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5400.54s)]
*  Less than two pounds. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5408.62s)]
*  And will you eat that morning or you usually will kind of just have something lighter? [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5410.219999999999s)]
*  I have something lighter because you don't like, you don't want to go ride with your [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5413.42s)]
*  belly full, you know? [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5416.46s)]
*  I have a coffee and I have like, you know, like a piece of bread or things like that, [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5417.42s)]
*  you know? [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5421.18s)]
*  Okay. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5421.82s)]
*  That one is an accident. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5422.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5424.14s)]
*  So I was going to ask Mario, have you had bad accidents? [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5424.3s)]
*  I just saw this on your Instagram. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5427.1s)]
*  You were sending a message to your fans telling them you were okay back in September 2020. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5428.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5433.02s)]
*  Back in September, I think that was a very hard one. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5433.5s)]
*  I got a good concussion out of that one, you know? [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5435.82s)]
*  So I landed on my head. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5439.02s)]
*  It just landed and I didn't move. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5440.62s)]
*  I got scared because I never landed that way. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5442.54s)]
*  And then, what is it? [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5445.66s)]
*  Like I just felt a pain that I didn't feel before and I was like, oh my God, I'm as good as gone. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5447.9s)]
*  That's exactly what I thought. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5454.54s)]
*  But then I was like- [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5455.58s)]
*  You're going to be in the wheelchair. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5456.06s)]
*  You're going to do the chariot races. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5456.78s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5457.98s)]
*  Unfortunately, we have a lot of fellow jokies that, you know, they- [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5460.14s)]
*  Get hurt. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5463.74s)]
*  They get hurt like that and then they're up in a wheelchair. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5464.22s)]
*  And so what happens, what is the number one accident that happens with horses and with [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5466.94s)]
*  racing? [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5472.22s)]
*  Is it that the horse stops and you fly off? [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5472.62s)]
*  Is that you get knocked off? [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5475.02s)]
*  Is it the trampling? [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5476.3s)]
*  Like what's the top deal that really gets you hampered out? [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5477.18s)]
*  It's like, for example, you can get trapped like my last fall. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5480.46s)]
*  I have a little clip, you know, there is like inexperienced riders or not inexperienced [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5485.66s)]
*  riders. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5489.66s)]
*  Sometimes a rider can be a little bit curled, you know, get too involved in the race and [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5490.3s)]
*  start shifting, you know, and then you get sandwiched in between horses and now your [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5494.860000000001s)]
*  horse clip heels, you know, trips and with the other horse legs. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5499.74s)]
*  And then I think that's the scariest part, you know, and then sometimes- [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5503.74s)]
*  So that would be the scariest thing. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5508.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, that would be the scariest thing, you know, because then like there is nothing in [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5509.5s)]
*  your control, you know, that is like you choose waiting. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5513.34s)]
*  I remember back when that happened, I was, I can see the guy shifting, but he was shifting [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5516.62s)]
*  a lot and I'm like, okay, he's going to realize he's doing this a lot. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5522.78s)]
*  And then I, so I kept riding my horse, right? [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5525.9s)]
*  Because I had a hole to go through, I kept riding, kept riding. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5528.0599999999995s)]
*  He kept going and by the time I'm like, I realized, okay, he's not gonna, he's not [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5531.5s)]
*  going to stop, right? [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5535.9s)]
*  And another horse was coming way faster in my outside and that's how the sandwich happened. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5536.94s)]
*  And by that time it was too late for me to do anything. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5541.66s)]
*  And I was just trying to hold as hard as I could and my horse tripped and I went flying. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5544.3s)]
*  And is it, where can the horse see when it's running? [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5551.0199999999995s)]
*  What can it see? [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5554.86s)]
*  Oh, horses go, like they can see like to their side, but the horse, like the eyes are like [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5555.58s)]
*  a little bit on the side. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5559.82s)]
*  So they, they, they, they're aware of horses coming behind, you know, they can look backwards. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5560.54s)]
*  And is it only men horses that run or female horses? [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5566.46s)]
*  Female horses. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5568.78s)]
*  Really? [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5569.74s)]
*  Only female? [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5570.3s)]
*  Only female horses. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5571.42s)]
*  You can ride, like you can mix each other, you know, you can, but that's not very common, [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5572.62s)]
*  but fillies run with the fillies, males run with the males, but we don't, we don't, [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5577.18s)]
*  we have equality in this sport. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5583.9s)]
*  So a female can run with the guys. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5585.339999999999s)]
*  So like in the Kentucky Derby, move this a little closer, if you don't mind. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5588.0599999999995s)]
*  In the Kentucky Derby, like, is it man in that race? [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5590.7s)]
*  Is it male horses or female horses or it's both? [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5593.339999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5595.58s)]
*  You got to get out of here. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5595.98s)]
*  It's both. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5596.62s)]
*  It's both. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5597.66s)]
*  I think one female horse won the Kentucky Derby. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5599.179999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5602.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5602.78s)]
*  I don't remember what's the name of the horse, but yeah, a female is not very common, [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5603.0199999999995s)]
*  you know, but like, yeah, no, they can run. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5607.74s)]
*  There's no restrictions whatsoever for a female horse not to enter. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5609.9s)]
*  You just have to qualify. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5615.339999999999s)]
*  If you're good enough to qualify, you can run. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5616.7s)]
*  So more commonly, a lot of the horses that you ride are male horses? [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5619.339999999999s)]
*  I know, both. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5624.219999999999s)]
*  It's both. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5624.86s)]
*  Both, both, both. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5625.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5625.9s)]
*  Do you notice a difference in the horses? [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5626.299999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5627.82s)]
*  Really? [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5628.299999999999s)]

*  is like we are all year around. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5801.02s)]

*  because if you're doing good, you need to keep that business. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5815.82s)]

*  You want to stick it with it while you can. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5826.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5828.22s)]
*  And if you're doing bad, then you have to stay there every day [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5828.62s)]
*  to somehow- [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5833.02s)]

*  I'll probably put my kid in that. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5839.1s)]
*  Yeah, it'd be fun, huh? [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5840.700000000001s)]
*  Could you imagine how fun that is if you're a kid? [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5842.38s)]
*  Because you're probably not going to get that hurt. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5844.46s)]
*  And you're just- the crowd loves it when those kids come out. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5847.02s)]

*  I feel like this fella, I've seen him, but it's nice to see him again. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5869.740000000001s)]
*  What's up, Theo? [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5872.22s)]
*  It's my birthday, so I wanted to send in a little question [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5873.9800000000005s)]
*  for your little equine piggyback fella you got there. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5876.54s)]
*  When I went to a horse race, I did a little betting. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5881.1s)]
*  So I was wondering if maybe the jockeys got in on that [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5883.5s)]
*  and maybe talking to the friend, [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5886.700000000001s)]
*  hey, I'm going to beat you, I bet you 10 bucks. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5888.780000000001s)]
*  Or maybe, you know, maybe they just talk shit all the time [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5891.900000000001s)]
*  when they're up there on them horses. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5894.94s)]
*  So, dang. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5897.339999999999s)]
*  Thank you, brother. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5900.0599999999995s)]
*  Happy birthday, man. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5900.62s)]
*  That's a good question. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5901.58s)]
*  Is there any, yeah, is there any Greg Williams and going on, [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5902.54s)]
*  there's any cross-betting amongst the group? [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5904.78s)]
*  You guys do any? [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5906.62s)]
*  We don't cross-bet, but we're like, [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5908.94s)]
*  we're so competitive with each other because that's another thing. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5910.94s)]
*  Like us jockeys, we're freelancers. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5913.66s)]
*  We don't make money. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5915.9s)]
*  We don't really, like, if you really want to make good money, [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5916.86s)]
*  you have to be able to, you have to be winning. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5919.179999999999s)]
*  Really? [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5921.339999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's the only time, you know? [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5921.82s)]
*  That's the only time you really make money, you know, winning, you know? [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5923.74s)]
*  Like say, if I ride five horses in a week and I finish last in all of them, [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5926.54s)]
*  I'll probably get 600 bucks. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5931.58s)]
*  Okay, so you get a small amount for racing. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5935.66s)]
*  And if you win, then you get percentage of the purse. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5938.46s)]
*  Like say Kentucky Derby, so that horse won. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5941.5s)]
*  Yeah, I get 10% of whatever that horse made. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5943.74s)]
*  Okay, what did that horse make? [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5946.219999999999s)]
*  Let's look it up. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5947.34s)]
*  Maybe like 1.6 million, I think. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5947.98s)]
*  So you get 160,000 or whatever, you get a 10%. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5952.3s)]
*  And now is that on any race you win? [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5954.9400000000005s)]
*  10%, 10% of the purse, yeah. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5958.06s)]
*  Wow, interesting. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5959.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5961.1s)]
*  That's really cool, man. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5962.7s)]
*  So wow, so it's really on you. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5964.9400000000005s)]
*  You got to get out there and do it, huh? [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5966.62s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5968.06s)]
*  So yeah, so to ask that question, yeah, there is like, [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5969.820000000001s)]
*  like because there's a lot of competition between us riders, you know? [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5973.74s)]
*  I can be like, I bet you can buy a bitch in this race, you know, that type of thing. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5976.14s)]
*  Right. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5979.34s)]
*  There's some riders that are just like all ego and just maniacs. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5980.46s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5983.66s)]
*  There is a lot of fights and there is all kinds of, you know, [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5985.0199999999995s)]
*  like if somebody cuts you off and from like, you know, we have fights, [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5987.58s)]
*  we have all kinds of things. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5990.86s)]
*  Hilarious. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5991.9s)]
*  It's hilarious, dude. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5992.46s)]
*  It's really hilarious. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5994.0599999999995s)]
*  What's a purse? [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5995.1s)]
*  So the Derby is 1.8 million, so that's a huge payday. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5996.0599999999995s)]
*  But what's it like a regular, you're doing these horses races weekly. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=5998.78s)]
*  What are the person? [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6001.74s)]
*  Regularly, various is like from like, I think $25,000 purse. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6002.54s)]
*  Here is the lowest one. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6007.0199999999995s)]
*  And then it goes up to in a normal regular day, it goes to like, you know, $65,000, $7,000. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6008.46s)]
*  And so if you have four races today, right? [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6015.66s)]
*  Say you have four races today and if the average race is a $40,000 race for the day. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6018.38s)]
*  So if you won all four of them, then you could make $40,000 then, right? [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6024.06s)]
*  Is that right? [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6028.06s)]
*  No. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6028.7s)]
*  Four thousand times 16. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6029.18s)]
*  You can make around $16,000. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6030.62s)]
*  Something like that. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6032.06s)]
*  That's great. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6032.7s)]
*  Wow. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6033.58s)]
*  That's cool, man. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6034.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6035.74s)]
*  And does all their money come from the betting? [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6036.22s)]
*  Yeah, the racetrack. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6038.7s)]
*  I think the betting, the racetrack puts up that money, you know? [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6039.58s)]
*  The racetrack puts the purse money, you know? [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6043.82s)]
*  And so no, actually it doesn't come from the bet. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6046.14s)]
*  The racetrack keeps all the money, all the betting money. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6049.34s)]
*  The racetrack does put the purse, but the purse don't necessarily come from the bet. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6053.9800000000005s)]
*  Otherwise we'll get a percent of betting and it will be probably much better for us. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6059.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6062.7s)]
*  You get that pay-per-view money then. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6063.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6064.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6065.58s)]
*  So then where you guys' money comes from? [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6066.3s)]
*  What, the entry fees, you think, or something? [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6067.9800000000005s)]
*  Who knows? [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6070.14s)]
*  I really don't know that part of it, but somehow the racetrack puts up that money. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6070.7s)]
*  I think it's a share of the gambling. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6075.66s)]
*  It's not all the gambling money is the purse. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6078.7s)]
*  But they probably take apart from there, you know? [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6080.7s)]
*  But like I said, they don't share that. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6082.38s)]
*  Right. They're not sharing all of it. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6084.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6085.900000000001s)]
*  They never are, dude. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6086.46s)]
*  So they never are. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6087.66s)]
*  That's how it is. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6088.7s)]
*  People paying for parking, you ain't getting a share of that. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6089.5s)]
*  There's a lot of things. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6091.820000000001s)]
*  Lin Monada, you ain't getting a share of that. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6092.860000000001s)]
*  Michelada. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6095.1s)]
*  There's a lot of things you're not getting a share of. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6096.459999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6098.7s)]
*  Wow, Mario. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6099.5s)]
*  I'm just trying to think of any other thing that really... [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6100.0599999999995s)]
*  Anything, bro. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6102.379999999999s)]
*  So now when would you switch hands with the whip? [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6103.339999999999s)]
*  Does that matter? [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6105.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6106.62s)]
*  Sometimes, yeah. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6106.94s)]
*  It matters because some horses like it better, you know? [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6108.54s)]
*  Or sometimes when the horse is still trying, but you need that little extra push, you know? [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6110.94s)]
*  You all of a sudden touch him from the other side. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6115.099999999999s)]
*  They get a little extra kick, extra push, you know? [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6117.5s)]
*  Like so all those little like... [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6122.219999999999s)]
*  But now we go into like super little details, you know? [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6124.22s)]
*  That yeah, little details matter, you know? [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6126.62s)]
*  Sometimes if you move a little bit too early, you're not going to be able to get there. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6128.7s)]
*  Or you get there too late or you move too soon and then somebody... [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6133.26s)]
*  You don't get there enough at the same time. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6138.22s)]
*  It's so interesting because a car, like a race car, you're in... [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6141.42s)]
*  You have an amount of gas that you know. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6146.06s)]
*  Everything is so finite. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6148.06s)]
*  Yes. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6149.66s)]
*  But with a horse, it's like kind of... [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6150.06s)]
*  You don't really know. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6152.780000000001s)]
*  So there's this... [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6154.46s)]
*  But that's our job. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6155.740000000001s)]
*  That's why we have to know, you know? [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6156.46s)]
*  Unfortunately, yeah, we don't know. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6158.06s)]
*  If we don't have it, if the horse just give us all mid-race, yeah, that's nothing we can do. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6159.18s)]
*  Sometimes that happens. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6163.900000000001s)]
*  Sometimes you just get on a horse mid-race. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6164.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6165.9800000000005s)]
*  Yes. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6167.26s)]
*  Or you don't... [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6167.900000000001s)]
*  Or sometimes you don't work with the horses in advance? [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6168.46s)]
*  Yeah, no. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6170.38s)]
*  Sometimes you don't. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6170.780000000001s)]
*  Sometimes you just get... [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6171.660000000001s)]
*  You choose that day. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6173.42s)]
*  You just ride in that... [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6174.620000000001s)]
*  Or somebody put you on a horse that you never ridden, [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6176.14s)]
*  that you never have even training, you know? [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6178.46s)]
*  So now it's our job to try to figure it out in 10 minutes what that horse is like. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6180.62s)]
*  Or even through the race, try to manage to see, okay, how is this horse? [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6185.9s)]
*  Am I still having something? [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6192.54s)]
*  Is this horse still have something? [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6193.74s)]
*  It's going to have something for the end? [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6195.9800000000005s)]
*  All of that we have to be able to tell, you know? [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6197.5s)]
*  When you chose your wife, did you choose a smaller woman [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6202.62s)]
*  because you want to make another jockey kind of woman? [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6206.62s)]
*  No, my wife is tall. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6208.3s)]
*  She is? [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6209.42s)]
*  Actually, all my... [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6209.9s)]
*  And Asians are tall. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6210.46s)]
*  Yeah, all my girlfriends. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6211.42s)]
*  I don't think I ever had a girlfriend like shorter or the same height as me. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6212.7s)]
*  Yeah, I like the long ones. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6221.42s)]
*  I like big girls. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6222.54s)]
*  Taller girls. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6224.62s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6225.099999999999s)]
*  Big difference. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6227.26s)]
*  Hey, whatever. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6227.9s)]
*  Big difference, huge difference, yeah. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6228.54s)]
*  English, yeah. [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6231.42s)]
*  Any other good questions that came in, Nick, from the videos? [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6232.7s)]
*  You said it's when your body tells you how you feel and how long do you plan on going? [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6235.02s)]
*  Personally, my goal is just to do this another six years. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6240.38s)]
*  To 40? [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6243.34s)]
*  Yeah, to 40, and that's it. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6243.900000000001s)]
*  Like I said, you sacrifice a lot, you know? [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6245.820000000001s)]
*  Like you always travel and then like my wife, like, you know, there is... [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6247.660000000001s)]
*  We have... [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6251.740000000001s)]
*  It's very hard to make friends, you know? [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6252.540000000001s)]
*  Because like friends usually do things on the weekend when I'm riding, right? [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6255.34s)]
*  So even if my wife, hey, let's make plans, like, there's always... [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6260.14s)]
*  I'm like, I'm never available for those type of things. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6262.94s)]
*  Even for my kid, you know? [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6265.259999999999s)]
*  Like I can't be just a part of the community of his school. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6268.0599999999995s)]
*  I'm not available for those things, you know? [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6272.0599999999995s)]
*  So it's a lot... [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6273.5s)]
*  This is the type of things that like I know I'm sacrificing right now. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6274.299999999999s)]
*  That's why I want to try to give my all. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6277.74s)]
*  By the time I reach 40, I want to be able to have something where I can lay back and be able to live off that and just be with my family. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6280.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6287.5s)]
*  How often do you get to... [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6288.54s)]
*  So you live here in Los Angeles? [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6289.82s)]
*  Yeah, in Los Angeles, yeah. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6291.259999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6291.9s)]
*  How often do you get to be at home then? [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6292.3s)]
*  Right now? [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6295.66s)]
*  Mostly with Santa Anita? [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6296.14s)]
*  Yeah, most of it is in Santa Anita, but then like I said, we go to San Diego, then back to Orange County. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6297.26s)]
*  There is another racetrack in Orange County. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6304.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6306.14s)]
*  But this is local. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6307.02s)]
*  So locally, we're moving a lot, right? [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6307.820000000001s)]
*  But then before, let's say before COVID, you know, like I ride for this guy that owns a lot of horses. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6309.9800000000005s)]
*  So usually he gets good horses. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6316.22s)]
*  When you get a good horse, you don't necessarily compete just here at Santa Anita. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6318.86s)]
*  If there is a big race in Louisiana or Kentucky or New York, Miami, you know, you travel to these places, you know. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6322.78s)]
*  So there's a lot of traveling going on, you know. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6330.0599999999995s)]
*  That's cool, man. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6333.5s)]
*  Is there one place that's not the... [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6334.3s)]
*  Is it fun to race in Louisiana? [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6335.74s)]
*  Is it fun to race in Miami? [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6339.34s)]
*  Is there a place that's really kind of cool to race? [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6340.62s)]
*  Miami seems like real beautiful and cool. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6342.46s)]
*  Yeah, Miami is cool. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6343.98s)]
*  Like I like going to Dubai. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6345.82s)]
*  Dubai is good. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6347.98s)]
*  Dubai? [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6349.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6349.66s)]
*  Wow, really? [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6350.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah, Dubai is cool. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6351.419999999999s)]
*  What is it about it? [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6352.7s)]
*  It's like too extravagant, you know, like it's like rich. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6354.7s)]
*  People eating gold. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6359.259999999999s)]
*  Basically, yeah. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6360.78s)]
*  The racetrack is like... [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6361.66s)]
*  People eating other people. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6362.78s)]
*  I think it costs like two billion to beat the racetrack. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6363.98s)]
*  There is like the hotel you can watch the race. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6366.379999999999s)]
*  Oh, it's just beautiful. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6370.219999999999s)]
*  It's fancy, huh? [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6371.9s)]
*  And a lot of money, too. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6373.5s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6375.099999999999s)]
*  Sometimes it's crazy to me how much money some people have. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6376.14s)]
*  I know, me too. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6379.1s)]
*  Isn't it crazy? [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6379.820000000001s)]
*  What are they going to do with it? [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6380.46s)]
*  I mean, you're not going to live eternally. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6381.42s)]
*  Yeah, it seems so crazy. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6383.740000000001s)]
*  And then you would see other people be poor. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6385.5s)]
*  It just is crazy to me sometimes. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6387.740000000001s)]
*  I don't think you really realize. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6391.42s)]
*  Like I remember I was very poor, you know, like I mean, we were struggling, you know, a lot. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6393.820000000001s)]
*  But all the way up to maybe 12, 13 years old. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6400.38s)]
*  You don't know. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6404.9400000000005s)]
*  Never really occurred to me. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6405.82s)]
*  I was happy. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6407.0199999999995s)]
*  I was laughing. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6407.9s)]
*  I know my mom loved me. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6408.78s)]
*  It's just my dad loved us, you know, like, yeah, we know that we didn't. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6411.0199999999995s)]
*  Because you are aware of things that you don't have, you know, we didn't have TV with it. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6414.62s)]
*  But that wasn't like something for to be asked to be depressed about. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6418.46s)]
*  I think the older you get, you know, even now, you know, like sometimes I feel guilt. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6423.1s)]
*  Or I feel like I try to think what my parents, because now I'm a parent, you know, my kid, [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6427.58s)]
*  and we're going to, you know, to the store or we're going to this. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6431.18s)]
*  I want that. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6434.22s)]
*  I want this. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6435.18s)]
*  And for me to be able to provide for him and kind of like whatever he wants, I buy him, you know, [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6435.740000000001s)]
*  and then to think, geez, you know, why are like I remember me as a kid when I was a kid, [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6440.54s)]
*  asking for things, but I never, I never got any, you know, I never got any. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6445.9800000000005s)]
*  I saw I, I now I go back and be like, you know, how hard what, you know, [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6449.9800000000005s)]
*  I will feel right now if my kid is asking me for something and I, [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6453.820000000001s)]
*  it was breaking your heart a little bit. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6457.34s)]
*  It will break your heart, you know, so I give it to my dad for that, you know, I mean, [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6458.62s)]
*  that probably was probably one of the hardest part for a parent to be able to [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6462.78s)]
*  give something that a kid is asking for, you know? [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6467.1s)]
*  Oh yeah, I bet man. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6470.3s)]
*  Yeah. I remember some of the gifts we would get even growing up were just like regular shit. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6472.06s)]
*  I remember my mom gave us something one time that we already had at home. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6476.38s)]
*  She just wrapped it up. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6479.42s)]
*  Oh really? Listen to me. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6480.3s)]
*  This is ours. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6483.5s)]
*  I have a little bit of a sad story, funny story. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6484.62s)]
*  I tell people sometimes now. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6488.14s)]
*  I always used to write to Santa freaking Santa. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6489.9s)]
*  Never, never like never got me anything. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6493.099999999999s)]
*  Right. So I probably was around like eight years old and I, I was writing to Santa [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6495.34s)]
*  and I don't know what I was asking for. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6502.86s)]
*  I know, I know he didn't give me what I asked for. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6504.46s)]
*  And then, but I remember writing, putting the car and then the next day woke up and [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6509.179999999999s)]
*  a present was there. [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6515.82s)]
*  So I was like, holy shit. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6517.82s)]
*  It worked. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6520.7s)]
*  It worked. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6521.5s)]
*  Like he didn't forget me this year, you know? [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6522.139999999999s)]
*  So I'm all excited. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6524.299999999999s)]
*  I go unwrap the present and I remember I had like this little soldier, you know? [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6525.42s)]
*  And I think I asked for a remote control car or something like that. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6529.66s)]
*  And I was so mad. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6533.259999999999s)]
*  I was so pissed off. [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6535.5s)]
*  I was like, you know, this is how can you got it wrong? [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6537.0199999999995s)]
*  And I was like, unbelievable. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6540.78s)]
*  You never came in. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6542.7s)]
*  When you came, you give me the wrong thing. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6543.74s)]
*  You didn't even, you didn't even give me what I asked for, you know? [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6545.66s)]
*  And I was like making this huge tantrum and I didn't tell anything about it, you know? [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6548.86s)]
*  Until now that I'm an adult, I'd be like, you know, like my dad probably bosses us [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6553.42s)]
*  to be able to provide that day and for me to be able to, that kind of rest my heart [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6557.42s)]
*  a little bit when I think about that. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6561.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6563.74s)]
*  It's hard to fit. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6563.98s)]
*  It's hard. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6564.62s)]
*  Sometimes it's weird to think how kids, like what parents want for their kids. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6565.0199999999995s)]
*  And then how kids sometimes are just unappreciative, but there's nothing you can do. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6568.78s)]
*  You're just a kid. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6571.74s)]
*  You don't know anything. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6572.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6573.099999999999s)]
*  You don't know. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6573.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6573.82s)]
*  When you're a kid, you don't know any better. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6573.98s)]
*  And sometimes it's like a clue. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6575.66s)]
*  My mom would give us a sort of be like, Hey, you should join the military. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6577.18s)]
*  Okay. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6582.54s)]
*  I guess I see the only way out. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6582.94s)]
*  Prepping you, prepping you. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6584.46s)]

*  It's so interesting just to think about what's going on now. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6597.02s)]
*  And now when I watch the race, I'm going to have such kind of a different inkling. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6600.7s)]
*  Is there any point, my last question, is there any point in the race where you would stand [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6604.06s)]
*  up on the horse or no, the goal is just to stay down? [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W62dhdkKNc&t=6607.660000000001s)]
