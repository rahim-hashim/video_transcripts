*  Just close your eyes. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=133.52s)]
*  It's like that. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=136.64s)]

*  That would be the fuck. That would be the fuck. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=149.76s)]
*  It would be dangerous. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=151.68s)]
*  It would be dangerous. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=152.48s)]
*  Talking about a cat toy. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=153.36s)]
*  Oh yeah. But you'd have to put a little bell at the end of it or something. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=156.24s)]
*  You would. And a feather. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=159.6s)]
*  Yeah. Nice to meet you, man. We never met. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=161.84s)]
*  Dude, you have such a crazy laugh, don't you? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=167.84s)]
*  It's real. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=172.88s)]
*  It's beautiful. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=173.68s)]
*  It's beautiful. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=175.20000000000002s)]
*  I shouldn't say that. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=175.84s)]
*  It's very hot. Is this, are we on TV? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=176.24s)]
*  Is this being recorded? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=179.04000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=179.92000000000002s)]
*  So yeah, my laugh is very high and that's how you know that it's real because it's so embarrassing [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=180.56s)]
*  and I do it anyway. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=185.20000000000002s)]
*  I like that. Yeah. And I shouldn't have said that. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=186.16s)]
*  It's not nice to condemn somebody's laugh or what? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=187.76000000000002s)]
*  Oh, I, you too. You can't hurt my feelings. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=190.48000000000002s)]
*  Okay. Go ahead and try. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=192.4s)]
*  I'll give it a run, man. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=193.28s)]
*  Okay. Good. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=194.48000000000002s)]
*  No, I think your laugh, it kind of reminds me of like a, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=196.64000000000001s)]
*  like a proud kind of grandmother from like maybe the 1850s or something. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=199.92s)]
*  Maybe totally sending her boys off to war. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=206.16s)]
*  Or like a woman that has got a new cookie recipe in the mail, you know? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=210.64s)]
*  It's joyful, but there's a sort of undertone of diabolic. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=215.2s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=218.4s)]
*  Yeah. But in my case, it's totally, it's totally real. And again, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=218.88s)]
*  it's not an appealing laugh. It's not like, wow, what a manly laugh that is. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=222.88s)]
*  It's not a chortle. It's more a giggle. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=226.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=228.24s)]
*  Yeah. No, it seems like a kid. Yeah. Like a kids would love it. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=229.44s)]
*  It seems like, um, but not too much. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=233.92s)]
*  Yeah. It reminds me of like Winnie the Pooh kind of, you know, you, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=238.48s)]
*  you low key do have a Christopher Robin vibe if he grew up, you know? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=241.92000000000002s)]
*  Thank you. I don't think he ever did though. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=245.36s)]
*  You think he exists only in the pages of the books. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=246.96s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=249.04s)]
*  Actually, there was a Christopher Robin that was Milne's son. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=249.68s)]
*  And he grew up to be a super bitter, bitter atheist who hated his dad. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=253.2s)]
*  Yeah. It didn't work. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=257.84000000000003s)]
*  Really? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=259.12s)]
*  It was all fantasy. Yes. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=259.36s)]
*  Wow. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=260.72s)]
*  Unless I'm misremembering that. A. A. Milne who wrote the book. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=261.2s)]
*  Yeah. He had kind of a tragic family life. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=264.08s)]
*  Oh, that's heartbreaking. Um, good to see you today, man. We never met before. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=266.88s)]
*  One of my children is like your biggest fan. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=272.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=274.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=274.32s)]
*  And are they like, how children are we talking? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=274.88s)]
*  Mid twenties. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=277.84000000000003s)]
*  Oh, that's fine. I'm just saying. I don't want, yeah. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=278.56s)]
*  I don't want. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=281.84000000000003s)]
*  Nothing creepy or anything. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=282.08s)]
*  Yeah. I don't need like, cause it's kind of weird that they allow like. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=283.36s)]
*  Little kids to watch you. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=287.44s)]
*  Sometimes it's weird that there's no barrier to entry in a lot of the world. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=289.44s)]
*  There's porn on Twitter, dude. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=292.64s)]
*  So, I mean, in a world that allows that, you're fine. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=293.68s)]
*  You think there should be porn on Twitter? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=297.2s)]
*  No. No, it shouldn't be porn on Twitter. I mean, I'm, you know, no. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=298.71999999999997s)]

*  I mean, I don't, I mean, I wouldn't, you know, spend a lot of time trying to ban porn on Twitter, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=304.56s)]
*  but like porn on Twitter, come on. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=307.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=309.03999999999996s)]

*  Right. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=321.20000000000005s)]
*  Um, I don't think everything is allowed on Twitter. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=321.6s)]
*  I haven't found the boundary yet, but, but Elon Musk who owns it has said he's for free speech. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=324.8s)]
*  And if it's a political view that most people don't like, it's still allowed. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=329.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=332.8s)]
*  And I'm so grateful for that. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=333.04s)]

*  Well, didn't they have, well, one thing that I don't like on Twitter, sometimes you see like [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=337.20000000000005s)]
*  on Twitter, sometimes you see like people beating up teachers and stuff like that. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=342.96s)]
*  You ever see any of this violence that happens? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=346.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=347.84s)]

*  But the fact that they allow it and kids beating up each other, they'll have like those things [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=348.71999999999997s)]
*  where somebody's going to set up a kid, somebody's filming some other kids like are going to come [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=352.88s)]
*  in and beat up the kid. Right. Um, but why did that? Cause then I feel like if they would stop [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=358.24s)]
*  allowing that then, cause other kids just start mimicking what they see. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=364.15999999999997s)]
*  Well, it's also bad. It's bad for you to watch it. I say someone's watched a lot of it. It's [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=367.52s)]
*  like the ISIS videos. Do you know what I mean? Or there's a whole bunch of channels of criminals [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=371.28s)]
*  getting shot coming into a jewelry store or a liquor store and some Korean guy just blows [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=375.84s)]
*  them away. And you can't help but love it. I mean, it is the most alluring kind of porn. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=380.79999999999995s)]
*  Like you just watch it again and again, this guy getting killed. And you think this is not good [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=385.84s)]
*  for me. Actually, I shouldn't watch this. Yeah. There's probably part of your spirit or whatever. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=389.44s)]
*  Totally. It's not edifying. It's like actually bad, but it's very hard. Have you ever seen the [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=393.44s)]
*  criminals getting killed? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=398.32s)]
*  Oh yeah. Yeah. I've seen a couple of them. There's one guy who's so good at it. He's killed like [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=399.52s)]
*  seven criminals. Yeah. He he's a watchmaker in LA. Yeah. No, it's a very famous guy. Oh, there's [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=402.55999999999995s)]
*  a one guy I'm like, dude, they got to quit trying to rob this guy. Well, he finally gave up. And now [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=409.44s)]
*  I think he lives in Vegas, but this was in the eighties or nineties in LA. I think he killed [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=414.47999999999996s)]
*  five people literally with revolvers too. This was before everyone had like a double stack, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=418.88s)]
*  you know, 19 round magazine. These were just like with conventional 38 or 357 revolvers. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=424.4s)]
*  That's him right there. Can you have that up for me? Nick? This is a, um, yeah, watch seller. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=429.76s)]
*  He's actually a watchmaker. He's the guy who, you know, fixes expensive watches and makes the new [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=434.71999999999997s)]
*  gears. He's a very, yeah. Look at that. Mr. Thomas, the dealer Lance Thomas was wounded five times at [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=440.0s)]
*  his shop. Wow. Let's see. He's like the, okay, I'm sorry. Is my memory pretty good or what? He [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=445.44s)]
*  killed five robbers since 89. That's amazing. He's like the 50 cent on watchmaker. He's like [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=450.64s)]
*  50 seconds. He's like, that's good. That dude's unreal. They ran me out of business. He's time. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=454.71999999999997s)]
*  It says there's got to be a truth. So there's got to be a time. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=462.0s)]
*  There's got to be a time when you walk away from the war zone. Wow. So he just quit because it was [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=466.32s)]
*  too. But what a BMF. I mean, he just, yeah, he shot a couple in one day. He says, this is his best [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=470.96s)]
*  quote. Mr. Thomas said he felt no remorse for the lives he had taken. The police ruled each [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=478.72s)]
*  shooting was justified. I was ice. He said a frightening thing about this is that it all [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=484.48s)]
*  becomes easier. Wow. It's not good for you to, I mean, you don't want to have to kill five people. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=489.28000000000003s)]
*  I don't, you know, I don't think it's, I don't think it's good for you. What's a fair amount of [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=494.16s)]
*  people to kill. I don't think you want to kill anyone if you can help it. You know, I mean, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=496.96000000000004s)]
*  well, it's certainly justified in self-defense. I mean, no one will judge you. No, no honest person [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=501.12s)]
*  will judge you for killing someone to protect your life or your loved ones, even your property. But [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=505.2s)]
*  I just don't think you want to have to do that. Yeah, I agree. I mean, well, unfortunately there's [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=510.88s)]
*  some people I think that wake up and they're kind of like kind of looking, you know, wouldn't mind [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=514.72s)]
*  getting into a little, you know, killing or whatever. But I think, yeah, I think you have a [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=519.84s)]
*  lot of people move into places where you can defend yourself, where the laws are more in your [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=526.3199999999999s)]
*  favor to defend yourself because it feels like your own safety has become your own responsibility. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=530.48s)]
*  You can't defend yourself. You're a slave. I mean, by definition, if someone can hurt you, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=536.5600000000001s)]
*  but you can't defend yourself, then you're not a human being. You're, you're subhuman, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=540.4s)]
*  obviously. Yeah. Like, cause that, that's a human, right? That precedes government. Right. I mean, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=544.88s)]
*  being a human, I think so. Defending yourself. You know, you have to be able to defend. If I walk up [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=548.88s)]
*  and punch you in the face and you can't hit back, I'm the master. You're the slave, obviously. Yeah. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=553.6s)]
*  Yeah. That's why I think it's one reason why you can't take guns away is because people have, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=558.8s)]
*  at the end of the day, have to be able to defend themselves or groups of people have to. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=562.48s)]
*  Well, of course. And the police, you know, they've got their own thing, their own concerns and yeah, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=565.92s)]
*  you can't rely on them. But I was thinking, yeah, what I don't like about those violence, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=570.48s)]
*  like the violence that they show on Twitter, where it's like the children beating up children, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=574.0799999999999s)]
*  is because if you're a kid and you see that and you see it gets a lot of traction, then you get [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=577.92s)]
*  to go do it. So you're just replicating this vibe. Like that. It's like you see so many more kids [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=583.44s)]
*  doing it now because they've seen it as like a thing. Like, so that kind of thing, I don't think [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=589.44s)]
*  they should allow one there. Well, also you don't want to see every ugly thing that people do. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=593.7600000000001s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? Yeah. You don't want to see fat people in the shower. You don't want to [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=598.6400000000001s)]
*  see people on the John. Like there are a lot of things that happen that you don't necessarily [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=601.6800000000001s)]
*  want to look at video of. I don't mind watching a thick person in the shower. If there's a real [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=605.7600000000001s)]
*  skinny person in there with them and they have to like kind of like jockey for position or [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=609.76s)]
*  something, you know, show them where somebody's hard. I think I don't know matter what size they [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=613.76s)]
*  have. Have you seen a lot of that? I think I've, I've been in some showers with some, you know, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=617.52s)]
*  with varying sizes of humans and yeah, it's always the fattest person you've shared with. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=622.56s)]
*  Oh, probably a good. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=628.4s)]
*  I'm trying to remember like real fat or just kind of bulky. I remember I picked this gal up one [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=630.08s)]
*  time trying to go back to how it felt on my back. I'd probably say upper ones, but you're not going [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=640.08s)]
*  to get into that. No, no, no, just as yeah. Yeah. Okay. You're lying. I can tell. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=651.2s)]
*  You are. Okay. No. Is there laws? Like, do you know if there's any laws? Like if there's people [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=661.0400000000001s)]
*  who are doing pedophiling and they are reaching out to children through social media, why isn't [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=671.6s)]
*  there a responsibility on the social media companies? Well, that's a great question. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=677.76s)]
*  Allowing that to be an open wall. I think there is. I think there is. And I think some have gotten [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=681.12s)]
*  in trouble for that. Oh, okay. Providing a space for that. I'm not a lawyer, but it's certainly [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=686.48s)]
*  wrong. Certainly immoral. Yeah. And I, and I, you know, you gotta think they make some effort to [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=693.2s)]
*  stop that though. I think there's, there's a lot of it. There are a lot of creepy people out there. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=698.08s)]
*  Yeah. And the number of creepy people is increasing. You think so? Seems to be. Yeah. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=701.68s)]
*  Seems to be. Yeah. I wonder why that is. Because you can look up other creepy people. It's kind [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=707.36s)]
*  of like you said you wouldn't allow video of kids fighting on the internet because it inspires other [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=713.84s)]
*  kids to fight. I think, you know, creepiness inspires creepiness. Yeah. That's a good point. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=719.2s)]
*  Yeah, man. I just want to get to know you a little bit. I want to get to know you too. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=726.16s)]
*  All right. Not like the whole shower thing. Oh, no. No, no, no. You don't weigh enough. I don't [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=730.16s)]
*  close. What I'm looking for. Okay. Yeah, man. Nice to meet you. So you grew up, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=735.04s)]
*  you grew up in California, right? I did. And so were you, I think people, were you in a fraternity? [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=741.92s)]
*  I think that's the most thing people look at when they see in a fraternity. Yeah. No, I wasn't. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=746.56s)]
*  No, really? No. Okay. I never joined a fraternity. All my roommates joined a fraternity. I actually [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=750.7199999999999s)]
*  lived in a fraternity, but I never joined. And I don't like to be told what to do at all. Really? [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=755.4399999999999s)]
*  No, me neither. Like at all. Like at all. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's my biggest. It's like I have a [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=759.92s)]
*  moral claustrophobia about being told what to do. I'm happy to do things. I don't mind serving other [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=767.04s)]
*  people, but it has to be voluntary. I can't be ordered around. Yeah. I don't like being told. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=772.24s)]
*  Hey, bitch, go get me a cigarette. You're a pledge. Yeah, that's a good point. I don't [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=776.88s)]
*  not going to do that. Yeah. And I don't want to be told what to do by some white kid that's in [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=781.36s)]
*  poly style or whatever. Or any color kid. Yeah. No color kid. Yeah. Yeah. Any or adult for that [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=787.28s)]
*  matter. I just don't want to be bossed around. And by the way, I don't mind taking advice or [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=792.8000000000001s)]
*  wise counsel from people I respect or I'm often wrong. I'm not saying that I'm always right. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=797.44s)]
*  I'm definitely not. But being ordered to do things suggests a level of disrespect. I just can't. I [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=802.16s)]
*  just can't deal with it at all. And even just about like work and stuff where you always like [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=809.04s)]
*  that from just like with work, like you want to be your own voice. Of course. Yeah. I mean, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=813.12s)]
*  that's where you end up getting fired. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, not that I don't want to fight [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=819.04s)]
*  about it. I'm not interested in being like, you can't tell me what to do or give a lot of [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=824.48s)]
*  lectures about it. But I deaf, especially my business, you have a similar job where you're [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=828.32s)]
*  paid to say what you think. Yeah. Right. And so you want to do your job, which is to say what you [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=833.44s)]
*  think. Was there even a time when you were working at different newsplaces where you were like, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=839.44s)]
*  gosh, this still isn't my own voice? Oh, all the time. Really? It was always my own voice, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=844.0s)]
*  but they're just you could feel the parameters. I mean, I started in my 20s, mid 20s, and now [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=849.6s)]
*  my mid 50s. So it's been a long time. Why you look great for 50s, man. I'm 54. Are you really? Yes. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=855.2800000000001s)]
*  Oh, wow. No, that's shocking. Shocking. I don't feel it. But anyway, but when you're when you're [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=861.84s)]
*  much younger and you've got little kids, I always had a lot of kids just reproduce like a crazy [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=868.0s)]
*  person. Yeah. Which I recommend strongly to you. You know, you feel vulnerable and like, you know, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=872.16s)]
*  you're not allowed to say certain things. And I do think I was never censored, but I self-censored [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=878.16s)]
*  for sure. You know, the war in Iraq breaks out and you're like, maybe it's a good idea. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=883.28s)]
*  It's not a good idea. And you know, it's not a good idea. You know what I mean? But you allow [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=889.52s)]
*  yourself to be convinced because, you know, it's super unpopular to say it's not a good idea, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=894.0s)]
*  but it clearly wasn't war with Iran. Not a good idea. I can say that now. Why do we go along with [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=898.64s)]
*  that consensus? A lot of times, what is it that makes us afraid to speak out? Well, people have [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=904.72s)]

*  shelter. You know, it's like people want to be connected to other people, which I understand. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=915.76s)]
*  And I want that too. But that can override reason and common sense very often. So if you're, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=920.24s)]

*  the right thing, but you should never ignore your gut, your instincts, which you inherited from your [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=946.56s)]

*  And I just feel like it's, you know, maybe because of my age and my job, I have a moral obligation [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=981.28s)]

*  that we should be involved in a lot of this shit. You think? Is it helping you a lot? [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=998.4s)]
*  No, it's a, just cause all these moral victories you're winning. It's causing more problems. I [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1004.88s)]
*  don't even know if I'm winning any moral victories. It just causes more problems. You know, it's like [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1008.7199999999999s)]
*  hard to navigate between my friends that are different ethnicities or different or from [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1012.8s)]

*  united in that. Right. But do you think, and I think when I, when I was a child, it felt like [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1021.04s)]
*  that we were all Amer, it felt like we were united, that we were all like Americans, but it doesn't, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1025.9199999999998s)]
*  I feel like that's been pretty heavily compromised pretty quickly even, which is almost amazing. And [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1033.6000000000001s)]
*  I feel like, and these aren't Debbie Downer feelings. These are just thoughts. I should say [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1039.8400000000001s)]
*  that. I think sometimes that, yeah, it's like, like America just feels like a shell company. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1045.0400000000002s)]
*  Yes. That, that, people just parked their assets. We're just an LLC for, for the world. A lot of, [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1051.76s)]
*  yeah. No, I mean, we always been that. Of course not. It was a real country. It wasn't just an idea [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1059.12s)]
*  or some shell company or LLC. That's so nice. I'm stealing that by the way. I hope this never airs. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1064.7199999999998s)]
*  So I can steal that. Yeah. But no, a buddy of mine, one of my best friends just sent me a video [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1068.56s)]
*  about eight minutes ago. He's dropping, he's visiting his daughter at parents weekend at a [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1073.6s)]
*  college, a well-known college. And there's a huge demonstration in the middle of campus between, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1078.2399999999998s)]
*  you know, two sides in the middle East. And one of the sides starts burning the other side's flag. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1083.68s)]
*  It's a foreign flag. Okay. Okay. And this fist fight breaks out and I'm like, I mean, I have [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1090.32s)]
*  views on, you know, who's more right or whatever, but I thought to myself, and I said to him, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1095.9199999999998s)]
*  if someone burned an American flag, nobody would fight over it. You get to burn the American flag, [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1100.1599999999999s)]
*  but burning the flag of another country, which is not our country to which we do not pay taxes, [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1104.8s)]
*  who's military, we don't serve it. That's the most offensive thing. I'm like, we have lost the [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1109.28s)]
*  thread, man. We're all Americans. And if you wind up in a place where our allegiance to other [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1113.76s)]
*  countries or regions or things that are not American take precedence over our common [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1119.92s)]
*  Americanness, I mean, we're screwed. We're screwed. I feel like we're at the apex of that sometimes. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1125.76s)]
*  Yes. And if we're not at the apex, apex of that, I don't think in the, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1133.36s)]
*  I can't tell if we're at that in the, I think we're getting to that in the moral compass of a [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1136.88s)]
*  lot of people. And it's sad because I think a lot of people, myself included, or for myself, [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1143.2800000000002s)]
*  I don't think I ever wanted to get to that place. I never, but I think a lot of people are just [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1149.5200000000002s)]
*  starting to feel like, you know, once your Americanism like dissolves and once your like [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1154.4s)]
*  common thread dissolves, you don't have a connection, you know? And so then you, [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1161.28s)]
*  it's your instincts start to take over, like we're kind of talking about, and you have to take care [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1166.8s)]
*  of yourself. And so once like the ice you're on starts to get melding, like before you're on an [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1171.6s)]
*  ice, you can skate, you're seeing other people, you're fucking do, you know, you're buying a, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1176.8s)]
*  you know, bootleg Gretzky Jersey off somebody, whatever you guys are all on the ice, right? [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1180.8s)]
*  You're imitating home alone. There's a fucking, you know, gays or there's gay guys always on the [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1185.36s)]
*  ice, but it's like, what are the gays doing on the ice? Skating, bro. Yeah. Stupid. But they're, [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1190.7199999999998s)]
*  yeah, but they're having fun, right? I lived and I'll say that I live with a gay ice skater and he [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1195.76s)]
*  could jump over a Volkswagen, right? That's impressive. Oh, it was unbelievable, bro. I'd [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1199.6s)]

*  room once and showed us and blew our minds, man. Beautiful guy. Not that great. I mean, pretty [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1210.1599999999999s)]
*  beautiful, I guess tall, tall, which adds a little bit too, obviously. Oh yeah. Kind of. I [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1214.48s)]
*  don't know. I'm going to quit thinking about him. But, um, but anyway, but once that ice starts to [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1220.8s)]
*  melt, the first thing you have to think about is yourself, right? And so that's what I feel like [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1226.0s)]
*  we're at now. And a lot of people are having to think about themselves, like literally watching [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1229.84s)]
*  our country or what we viewed as our ideals and morals and what we held dear, like sink in this [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1233.76s)]
*  water and there's nothing you can do about it except take care of yourself. That's where I feel [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1241.28s)]
*  like a lot of people are at. There's nothing they can do right now, but take care of themselves. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1244.3999999999999s)]
*  And they're displacing a lot of their frustration about our economy, which we never talk about. It's [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1247.84s)]
*  getting very expensive for people to live here. Like too expensive, actually. Oh yeah. I saw some [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1253.04s)]
*  gals the other day. I was like, Jesus, man. How do people afford that? Yeah. You know, how do you [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1256.72s)]
*  even do a bonfire anymore? That's totally right. Yeah. No, it's completely right. Yeah. How do you, [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1260.3999999999999s)]
*  if you want to take gasoline and pour it on the pallets, like it's six bucks, right? But, um, [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1265.12s)]
*  but they're displacing a lot of that frustration onto regions, countries, conflicts that are [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1271.84s)]
*  thousands of miles away. It's almost like I'm picking a team and all my rage is going to, [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1277.04s)]
*  and I do wish people reserve their anger for our leaders who deserve it, in my opinion, on both sides [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1282.16s)]
*  and for the problems that are like besetting the country. You drive through America recently, [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1287.6s)]
*  it's like not in good shape at all. It's kind of poor actually, shockingly poor. And people should [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1291.04s)]
*  be really mad about that. And instead they're mad about whatever, Israel, Hamas. I mean, I get it. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1296.72s)]
*  I think they're, you know, I understand people are upset on both sides. However, you, it's unhealthy [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1302.08s)]
*  to spend all your time in your head enraged about a foreign conflict when your own country is [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1308.72s)]
*  suffering so badly. Like we need that energy, that constructive energy here. And I never hear [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1313.28s)]
*  anybody say 108,000 people died of fentanyl ODs last year in my country. Oh yeah. Like young people, [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1318.64s)]
*  a lot of whom weren't doing fentanyl. They were taking Percocet or Benzos and they [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1324.24s)]
*  ingested a pill with fentanyl in it and they died. They were poisoned to death. Okay. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1330.48s)]
*  That's unbelievable. That's outrageous. No one seems mad about that. They're mad about some foreign [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1334.4s)]
*  war and what a waste, you know, because we can't control that anyway. Yeah. What do you call a [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1340.24s)]

*  It's just unbelievable how many people I got killed in no care or concern. No. And then the way that [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1620.56s)]
*  they lobbied our own FDA people, they took them off of the job and paid them more to work for them [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1624.48s)]

*  easy. You're sober 18 months. One of the reasons I don't do cocaine anymore is because they fucking [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1665.84s)]
*  ruined it. Why? With the Fentanyl. It used to be this baby laxative. Yeah, but I'd rather shit than die. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1669.6s)]
*  I agree with that. I'd rather get off the toilet and be like, Oh, I was hectic than be like, you [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1676.32s)]
*  know, laying there just like God, go in blue. Yeah. But I got to go to heaven. And that, and that, [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1682.1599999999999s)]
*  by the way, is a guess. Okay. But, um, that's the hope. But how's it been 18 months? It's been good, [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1688.64s)]
*  man. I love it. You know, how were the first six weeks? That's the toughest part. Oh, I know. I've [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1698.0800000000002s)]
*  been there. Oh, you have? Yeah. What did you have to get off of? Oh, you name it. Yeah, it's been 21 [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1703.3600000000001s)]
*  years, but yeah. But you still, you can drink though. No, I can drag into a little blow. I can [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1708.72s)]

*  Shepherd Smith? Okay. That's funny, but I'm not going to comment on it beyond that. That's fine. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1720.0800000000002s)]
*  No, and no dig to shepherd. I'm a fan of shepherd. Yeah. But he's just a legend in a lot of circles [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1728.16s)]
*  from a lot of friends of mine from different colleges. How do you know all this? It's like, [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1733.0400000000002s)]
*  dude, it's easy. You just be alive and you just pay attention. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1737.2s)]
*  Well, without commenting on that, I will say, no, sobriety has been cool for me, man, but it was [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1739.84s)]
*  tough the first six weeks. Like how would you do? Yeah. I think what's tough is like having to change, [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1746.3999999999999s)]
*  having to quit some, you know, having to not have a beer if you need it, having to not like have [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1752.48s)]
*  something to give me a little bit of respite. Yes. That's right. Owning angst. Yes. That's a lot of [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1757.6799999999998s)]
*  it. Did you go off everything? Yeah. So I didn't have a problem with anything except for cocaine. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1764.0s)]
*  So if I drink, I could have a drink. I'd be fine. I hated drinking, but I know if I have a drink, [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1769.2s)]
*  the only reason I'm going to have it is so I can go, I'll have four sips and then I'll go get some [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1774.24s)]
*  cocaine and then I'll be. How did you deal with feeling terrible the next day on the cocaine? [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1778.0s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, poorly brother. Begging people for Gatorade over text message. Yeah. It was horrible, [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1782.88s)]
*  dude. Yeah. And this, this was some of this, they didn't have that. It's a high cost drug. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1790.16s)]
*  Yeah. And not just on the front end on the back end. Yeah. The next day was horrible. The sad, [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1794.0s)]
*  like the things that have to apologize for. Yeah. What's the freakiest thing you did while on cocaine? [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1798.08s)]
*  Oh dude, I'll tell you some of the, well, the weirdest thing is what I would [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1803.28s)]
*  look for escorts on the internet. Right. And classic cocaine move there. Yeah. Hunter Biden [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1806.8s)]
*  has plowed this furrow before. Others, others have been where you were. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1813.12s)]
*  Literally. Yeah. I think Hunter even was my plug on some of this. And so he, I would, but then [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1818.72s)]
*  they would come to my residence. I would be so scared and paranoid. I would take the money [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1826.4s)]
*  and hand it out the door. Cause I didn't want to not pay for the, you know, I, you know, they, [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1832.64s)]
*  service they drove over, right? You know, so yeah, I would pay them. And then I would just be grateful [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1838.96s)]
*  that they weren't there. So you, you wouldn't stiff the hooker, but then you wouldn't stiff the hooker. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1845.52s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Well played brother. I think, look, I just felt bad. You must have been their favorite [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1850.0s)]
*  account. Well then sometimes dude, I had to talk to a lady who speaks another language. That's crazy. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1857.44s)]
*  Cause then you're playing charades. You're fucking high on cocaine. You were ordering the human [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1863.68s)]
*  trafficking ones. I wouldn't say that. These people were off the interstate. I would say that. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1867.68s)]
*  Yeah. They weren't like, what are they called them? Lot lizards? No, this was out of this was, [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1874.32s)]
*  I mean, they weren't, I think these were decent ladies who were trying to make a dollar. I never, [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1879.12s)]
*  yeah. Anyway, this didn't get in well, but, but yeah, that was, that was kind of the toughest part. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1885.28s)]
*  Cause I was just looking for some kind of connection. Of course. And I just, [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1891.28s)]
*  that's a real thing. What you just said, I get that. I didn't know how to get it. Cause it's [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1895.2s)]
*  isolating is drugs and alcohol are isolating. You're, you're really about yourself when you're [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1898.48s)]
*  doing them. And part of you wants to reach out and connect with someone else. I think that's [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1903.04s)]
*  absolutely, I think that's absolutely right. Yeah. I like cocaine because I needed to control how [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1906.72s)]
*  I felt immediately. That's one thing reason I didn't like alcohol because I, I was just such [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1910.96s)]
*  a control person that I needed to control how I felt immediately. So cocaine, I could do it [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1916.32s)]
*  immediately. I would, the feeling would be there immediately. Yeah. And so that's one reason that [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1920.8s)]
*  I liked it. But you never got into Xanax or alcohol or anything to help you come down. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1925.6000000000001s)]
*  No, I wish I had, I didn't know you could do that. Oh yeah. You can do that. Oh, I mean, [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1931.68s)]
*  I don't think it's legal, but you can. So I was doing it wrong. You had the wrong kind of cocaine [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=1936.0s)]

*  Bobby's a neat guy, isn't he? [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2114.4s)]
*  He is. He's a very deep person and he's learned the right things. And people like that [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2115.36s)]
*  make me very pro 12-step because like they're just like, I'm not in control of my life and they're [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2120.16s)]
*  not because nobody is. Everyone lies about it. I've got it under control. No, you don't. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2124.72s)]
*  You have no freaking idea what you're doing. You can't extend your life by a single day. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2130.0s)]
*  You're lying to yourself and those around you. Just admit you have no clue. You're doing the [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2133.12s)]
*  best you can. You're a totally screwed up kind of embarrassing person. You know what I mean? [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2137.84s)]
*  Okay. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2142.24s)]
*  And be liberated. And so I strongly believe in that because it's true. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2142.56s)]
*  It is the truth. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2148.4s)]
*  I know. And the rest of it is such a fucking, such a sled we pull. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2149.44s)]
*  And it's fake. And it is ridiculous. As I always say to my kids, everybody knows who you really [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2154.2400000000002s)]
*  are. Everybody already knows what your bad qualities are and they love you anyway. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2159.92s)]
*  So don't even try and hide them. I mean, I'm sure you know, people were like alcoholic or bad temper [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2164.48s)]
*  or secretly gay or whatever. And they're like, oh, no one knows. No one knows. It's like everybody [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2170.64s)]
*  knows. Are you kidding? And again, they love you anyway. So you don't need to hide it. Just be who [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2177.28s)]
*  you are. And when you are, I mean, you are so liberated. It's this massive weight coming off [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2183.28s)]
*  you. It's like, yeah, kind of fucked up, but you know, more than some, less than others, but trying. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2189.36s)]
*  And people are like, that's great. Yeah. People are way less judgy than you think they are. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2196.0800000000004s)]
*  Right. And there's some, there's some inverse of it, you know, where it's like we think someone's [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2201.1200000000003s)]
*  so, but then if we look at the way we look at people, we might have some jokes about it, stuff, [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2205.52s)]
*  but most of the time you have empathy. At dinner two nights ago, I'm sitting next to this woman [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2210.96s)]
*  and she said something about, it's a long story, but basically it was about a woman gaining weight. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2217.12s)]
*  And I said to her, you know, I've never been in a group of just men on a hunting trip or, you know, [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2222.88s)]
*  we're just men. Yeah. Where someone's like, ah, she had a fat ass. It's like men have the widest [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2228.32s)]
*  strike zone imaginable. Men like women, heterosexual men like women. They don't judge [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2233.12s)]
*  their appearance very harshly at all. They kind of tend to like all sorts of women. That's true. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2239.2s)]
*  And if you knew how nonjudgmental men were about women's appearances, you would relax. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2243.6s)]
*  But of course you don't care what men think about your appearance. You only care what other women [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2248.16s)]
*  think about your appearance and they're very judgy. But it's the same principle. It's like, [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2250.88s)]
*  we are less judged than we think we are, you know? Yeah. It's funny, but you, we don't, but [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2254.56s)]
*  it's not the nature of us to think that we are. Did you tell people when you quit using cocaine? [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2261.2s)]
*  Yeah, I did. I think. Let me think. Yeah. Yeah, I did. I told them. Well, I got into meetings. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2267.4399999999996s)]
*  I didn't. It was been in my family, you know, my family, a lot of my family. It's in my family. So [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2277.68s)]
*  cocaine thing, the drug, just alcohol, childhood issues. Really? A lot of it is more. A lot of my [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2284.3199999999997s)]
*  stuff comes from really intimacy disorders, like emotes, like connectivity disorders, [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2292.24s)]
*  you know? So, but then whenever anything triggers one of those connectivity disorders, [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2299.52s)]
*  then my, a lot of times it would lead me to doing drugs. So, [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2306.0s)]
*  um, yeah, I, I, I, I'm, I just love it though. What I love about it is now I get to see, [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2310.88s)]
*  man, I saw a dude yesterday who just got, uh, a six month ship, you know, and the guy, [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2317.44s)]
*  man, to see somebody whose life has changed, you get to witness. It's unbelievable. It's unbelievable. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2324.4s)]
*  I totally agree. I had a friend call me this morning, right? And we've been friends for years [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2329.04s)]
*  and we kind of both know that we have some of the same problems. And, uh, it was like the first time [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2335.04s)]
*  he like opened up to a man and we're both sitting there just kind of crying on the phone. It was [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2340.72s)]
*  just, cause when he opened up, it just made me kind of, it just made me feel like I was like, [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2344.0s)]
*  I don't know. I just understood him and it was like, I don't know. It was just so important. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2348.72s)]
*  Well, that's what intimacy is. Yeah. I've always thought that we misread intimacy. We think it's [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2353.6s)]
*  when someone tells the truth about other people. It's very easy to tell the truth about other [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2358.56s)]
*  people. It's only when someone tells the truth about himself, it's only when you admit who you [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2363.12s)]
*  really are to someone else that you have intimacy. That's the measure of intimacy. If you're willing [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2367.6s)]
*  to tell someone who you really are, you are intimate with that person and vice versa. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2372.96s)]
*  And that's totally the key. So if you want to know how many truly close relationships do I have, [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2378.16s)]
*  that's how you know how many people am I willing to admit what a schmuck I actually am too. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2383.8399999999997s)]
*  That's the number. And what I love about 12 step, I've never actually been to 12 step. I've only [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2389.6800000000003s)]
*  heard about it. Actually when I was at Russell Brand's house in the summer and he had a meeting. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2393.76s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, that's cool. Hilarious people. Was it? I didn't stay for it. I had to leave, but they were [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2397.76s)]
*  one of the guys was smoking, which I love and just old school and they were anyway, but, but [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2403.6s)]
*  I love the 12 step thing. Cause you just like, as with Christianity, which I also like you [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2410.48s)]
*  admit right away that you are powerless. Yeah, exactly. You're not in control. Your life's [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2416.08s)]
*  unmanageable. That's a nice word that they use a lot because it's like, sometimes people are like, [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2422.08s)]
*  man, I'm not powerless, but I'll be like, no, things are unmanageable for me. The way that they [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2426.16s)]
*  phrased everything, it was just really articulate. But anyway, man, well congrats on that. Yeah. I [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2431.68s)]
*  think it's interesting and it gives me a better scope to handle my own life, you know? And it [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2436.48s)]
*  definitely gives me more opportunity to look at other people when I'm able to. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2440.96s)]
*  Do you find yourself less judgmental and what about all the guys you used to do cocaine with? [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2445.68s)]
*  I did it by myself. Good. That's a fun way to do it. Chopping outlines at home. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2450.8s)]
*  I'd change outfits and come back in and be a different guy. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2459.52s)]
*  And like, Hey, don't do it. This is for me. You know, is yelling at the other me. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2464.48s)]
*  You're literally doing it alone. Oh yeah, brother. I would do it alone and I'd go hide it somewhere. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2470.96s)]
*  And I'd be like, I'm going to bed and not do it anymore. And then I would fucking get up and go [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2475.76s)]
*  find it. You know, and I would do more and it does affect your sleep patterns. Yeah, bro. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2480.48s)]
*  I've heard that. Yeah. Most of my sleep patterns was me praying, dude, that somebody would fucking [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2488.16s)]
*  pour Gatorade down my chimney. I was just, why Gatorade? Why Gatorade? Just because it's like, [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2494.48s)]
*  has electrolytes in it. I would be so dehydrated. So you're not much of a planner. No, no, no. You [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2500.48s)]
*  didn't go to Costco ahead of time. Just get a pallet of it for home. No, no, bro. Did you have [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2506.0s)]
*  some pretty crazy nights or no? I had a few. Yeah. The good news is that, I mean, it was a different, [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2511.6s)]
*  I'm 54. So it was a different time in the world that I started where I started working in 91. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2520.96s)]
*  Everyone went to lunch every day. And I was a writer at a magazine and everyone went to lunch [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2526.8s)]
*  for an hour and a half every day. Period. I mean, it was a different economy. It was, this was before [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2531.76s)]
*  the corporations took over everything and implanted chips on your phone to listen to your conversation, [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2536.56s)]
*  track your whereabouts. And before we became East Germany, they didn't really know where you were. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2540.48s)]
*  And it was just a civilized place and you could just have lunch. And if you drank, it was totally [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2544.56s)]
*  within bounds to have a couple drinks at lunch, you know, and smoke at lunch. And then that could [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2548.48s)]
*  keep going. I'm not saying it was great for productivity, but it was a better country. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2554.4s)]
*  That's just a fact. It was. Yeah, it was some fun. And so [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2557.28s)]
*  I would just say the great blessing in my life is it definitely erased my memory of a number of [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2563.36s)]
*  years. So I don't have a lot of guilt, somebody because I don't really remember what I was like, [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2568.48s)]
*  but I don't think very appealing. Yeah. Not a great drunk. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And when you drink, [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2573.6800000000003s)]
*  even if you're not setting out to say, use cocaine, you can wind up doing that. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2580.6400000000003s)]
*  Oh, yeah. If somebody's got some cocaine, you're going to stay around them until they don't have [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2587.44s)]
*  it anymore until you have it. I've heard that. Yeah, that's true. Oh, yeah. That's me right there. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2590.88s)]
*  I did one time I was doing some cocaine at the house and people like, I was like a big vest guy [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2595.92s)]
*  for about 11 months and vest with nothing underneath. Yeah. Just fucking that's kind of [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2604.96s)]
*  like the Chippendales thing. Some shades. Yeah. Just chilling in my apartment. Did you ever dance? [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2610.08s)]
*  Huh? No, I wouldn't dance. I'd make a smoothie, but we're just kind of like dancing, but just [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2614.64s)]
*  doing literally nothing underneath it. Just the vest. Yeah. No, no, no. Just the vest. Yeah. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2620.32s)]
*  Cause I was just in California too. The weather, it was, you know, weather permitting. Yeah. It's [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2623.84s)]
*  totally normal. I mean, I remember I grew up in California and I'd often wear a vest, a silk [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2627.68s)]
*  vest kind of against my nipples. I liked it. Dude, remember when silk came out and it was like, [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2632.48s)]
*  remember silk shirts? Oh yeah. They were so bad. I'm not going to. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2637.04s)]
*  Never. Yeah. I never wore a silk shirt in my whole life. You're lying. No, I swear. Yeah. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2643.92s)]
*  Never. I never fell for that. Good for you. Actually. I fell for it. I never bought anything [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2649.04s)]
*  from Fila. Oh yeah. I never did. I never had anything that was velour. I mean, their whole [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2652.56s)]
*  epochs in fashion history that is missed. I just totally ignored it. I've been wearing the same [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2658.88s)]
*  freaking clothes since 1984. And I mean it. Well, I'll leave that dude. If you just stay exactly [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2664.2400000000002s)]
*  the same, like someday this will be super cool for a moment and then we'll move on to something [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2669.12s)]
*  else. We'll go back to vests. When I was in school, it was good, man. That was good. Yeah. Yeah. You [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2673.76s)]
*  kind of, you seem like you were conceived at like a Johnson and Murphy and something just fucking [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2678.4s)]
*  rolled right out. I don't know what that is, but I will take that as a compliment. Yeah. It's a [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2682.1600000000003s)]
*  compliment, man. My best friend, Kevin, likes that that store. What's Kevin do? He does. I don't know. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2685.36s)]
*  He's looking for a place right now, but his wife's he got married, but that's Johnson and Murphy. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2691.52s)]
*  They're at the airport. He's a producer. I buy almost no clothes at the airport, [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2696.6400000000003s)]
*  but I'm not against it. So let's get into something important then. Right. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2702.2400000000002s)]

*  that in leeches are like completely ignored by the medical establishment. But yeah, it was, [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2897.68s)]
*  it was common. The procedure was used to treat gut pain and attempts were often made. I'm not [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2904.3199999999997s)]
*  making this up. You're fact checking me in real time. No, I love this, but applying it by enema [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2908.16s)]

*  process for someone to say, okay, we've reached this point in civilization where somebody's got [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2934.56s)]
*  to blow smoke up someone else's ass. Is that before or after the wheel? Cause they never figured out [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2938.56s)]
*  the wheel. I think it's four years. Somebody's blowing smoke. Really? It's quick. I mean, I don't [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2944.64s)]
*  know. It'd be interesting to see how the first things happen like that. How are the pyramids [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2953.2799999999997s)]
*  built? I don't know. People talk about it a lot. People don't know. We don't know. How is that? [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2956.24s)]
*  And I'm not by the way, suggesting any theory. Yeah, no. Well, look, I think. But how do we not [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2962.0s)]
*  know that? And why doesn't that make all of us humble? Like if we don't know how they built the [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2965.52s)]
*  pyramids, three or 4,000, or actually we don't know when the pyramids were built, to be totally [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2970.4s)]
*  honest. Yeah. If we don't know that, then we don't know shit. Yeah. Right? Oh yeah. Someone should [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2975.2000000000003s)]
*  just say that. Yeah. Why don't we just say we don't know shit? Yes. Yeah. All wisdom begins with [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2982.0s)]
*  acknowledging what you don't know. And anyone who tells you, I know the answer, is about to lead [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2988.08s)]

*  that's a lie. Yeah. So never trust anybody who claims to have it all figured out because he's [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=2997.84s)]
*  lying to you. Well, do you think that one of our, that one of the political parties thinks that they [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3002.48s)]
*  have it all figured out more than the other? I think they both do. I mean, I think politicians [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3008.0s)]
*  by their nature are unwilling. By the way, every once in a while you get somebody who shows up and [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3013.52s)]
*  starts to tell a portion of the truth and everyone loves him. And then he's always invariably accused [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3019.12s)]
*  of r-ing someone at that point. They gotta take him out. Yeah. They're like, anonymous charges. He [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3025.68s)]
*  r-ed me in 1985. I can't tell you my name, but it happened. They just did this to Russell Brand. Yeah, [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3031.28s)]
*  there's always somebody, yeah, they'll come out with anybody. Yeah, but or nobody in his case. I [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3037.12s)]

*  23andMe? I mean, you're positive. Okay. I'm pretty, I mean, yeah, you're right. Because you don't know, dude. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3058.08s)]

*  and 13. Someone offered to buy them from us outside of the game. And we said, okay, we'll sell you our [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3088.56s)]
*  tickets. They were selling, offering $25. And we'd never had that kind of cash. And so we said, [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3093.28s)]
*  okay, we'll do it. And then they said they were undercover cops and they were going to take us to [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3098.2400000000002s)]

*  the people who have power currently. The point of journalism is to challenge the people who have [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3348.96s)]
*  power on behalf of the rest of the country. And they've inverted the formula. And so if you work [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3351.92s)]
*  for the Washington Post, the idea is just protect Jeff Bezos and his friends at all costs, and that's [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3358.96s)]
*  what they do. But I'll tell you a way that I think is a good start to figuring out what's true is [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3364.2400000000002s)]
*  watch what they become hysterical about. You'll see somebody occasionally say something and people [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3371.28s)]
*  just land on him. Shut up! Shut up! Let's put him in jail! Whatever that guy is saying is true, [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3376.56s)]
*  or it points in the direction of the truth. When someone says something that's like legit and say [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3384.48s)]
*  no one's mad at the schizophrenic on the bus, you know, who's talking about whatever, the earth is [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3388.88s)]

*  duck, goose on a- Yeah, totally. Nobody cares because he's not a threat to anyone because he's insane. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3399.36s)]
*  Insane people are not a threat to the existing order because they're crazy. They're self-discrediting. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3404.8s)]
*  But when they become hysterical about somebody and they're like, he's a conspiracy theorist without [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3409.6800000000003s)]
*  even refuting what he told you, then you know he's onto something. I mean, a hurt dog barks, right? [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3415.6000000000004s)]
*  When you have an infection, someone touches near the infection and it hurts. What does that tell [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3421.84s)]
*  you? You have an infection. Yeah. Oh, I see what you're saying. Well, do you think that's one of [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3424.88s)]
*  the reasons why Bobby Kenyon was looked at as so crazy? 100%. Yeah. And what's so funny, as I said, [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3429.1200000000003s)]
*  I saw him, you know, very recently the other night and I said to him and I saw him, I sort of [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3434.32s)]
*  follow it. I'm just interested in the reaction to Bobby Kennedy. And remember they attacked him as [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3441.1200000000003s)]
*  a crazed conspiracy nut because of the vaccines. And he said there may be a connection between the [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3445.92s)]
*  vaccines and autism. Like, shut up. And they literally, they canceled his contract with the [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3450.96s)]
*  New York Times. He had a contract to write for them. They canceled it. Wow. And they just basically [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3455.2000000000003s)]
*  drummed about a polite society. They don't talk too much about that anymore. Right. But the vaccine [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3459.28s)]
*  stuff, because I think there is this recognition, and by the way, I'm not an expert, but that [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3464.2400000000002s)]
*  actually a lot of people were hurt. A lot of people were hurt. Not just with the most recent [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3469.1200000000003s)]
*  round of mandatory Vax, but in earlier rounds. Now you could argue it was worth it. You know, [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3473.1200000000003s)]
*  we have a flu vaccine. It academically supposedly prevents the flu. So maybe we get it. And some [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3477.6000000000004s)]
*  people get hurt, but they were telling us for years, nobody gets hurt. Well, that's just a lie. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3482.32s)]
*  Yeah. People get hurt all the time. They get hurt all the time. Yeah. I mean, a lot of vaccines. It's [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3486.7999999999997s)]
*  like even the polio vaccine. I, I, I recite this a lot, but they, they tested the polio vaccine in [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3490.24s)]
*  our hometown where I'm from. They had a primate testing facility there. And, um, are you serious? [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3495.12s)]
*  Yeah. And that's where they tested the polio vaccine. You grew up in a town with a primate [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3500.8799999999997s)]
*  testing facility. Yeah. What town? Tulane National Primate Research Center. That's got to be the most [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3504.08s)]
*  depressing place in the world. Is it in New Orleans? It's as uptown. It's outside of New Orleans. No, [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3511.2s)]
*  this is outside of New Orleans. Yeah. They don't allow that in Autobahn Park. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3515.44s)]
*  But, uh, in our town, this is where they made it at, but that vaccine gave cervical cancer [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3520.88s)]
*  to tons of women and they knew it when they put it out, but they'd already ordered it. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3526.2400000000002s)]
*  They're like, well, fuck it. We already paid for it. So exactly. But so I think that it's bad to [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3530.96s)]
*  lie and it's especially bad to lie at scale. Like if I lie to you about something and, you know, [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3537.12s)]
*  but if I'm lying to 350 million people, that's a, that's a crime and they've done it. And the [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3542.72s)]
*  problem is at this point, it's like, I mean, I, I would go to a surgeon, you know, cause that's a [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3548.48s)]
*  pretty straightforward operation. I've got a knife. I'm going to take this thing out or sew this up [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3553.92s)]
*  or whatever, but I don't think I would go to a doctor for, well, we're going to try this drug. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3557.52s)]
*  It's like, maybe I would. I mean, I, I don't know. Yeah. I haven't had to make that choice, [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3562.64s)]
*  thankfully, but I would be hesitant because I don't trust them because they lied. They got [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3566.96s)]
*  caught lying and they never admitted it. That's it. That that's part of it. There's never any [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3571.04s)]
*  resolution. There's never any affirmation to your questioning. And even if you were right, [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3575.04s)]
*  there's never any about facing knowledge. It can't get better. If you get in a fight with your girl, [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3583.36s)]
*  okay. And one of you behaves horribly. One of you's on say cocaine and says something outrageous [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3588.56s)]
*  and you want to continue the relationship. There has to come a point where you're like, you know, [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3595.04s)]
*  I really was an asshole and I'm sorry and I love you and I'm sorry I did that. And only when you [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3598.0s)]
*  do that, can it get better. It cannot be healed before you do that. It doesn't work. And that's [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3602.4s)]
*  true with public trust as well. And that's where we've gotten. It's gotten to the point. But I don't [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3606.88s)]
*  understand why they can't admit it. Like I've been wrong about a ton of things and I feel so much [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3609.92s)]
*  better when I admit it and stop pretending that I'm omniscient. I don't know everything and that's [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3613.52s)]
*  okay. Why can't they do that? Why can't Fauci just be like, wow, you know, I told you this in good [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3618.24s)]
*  faith. I was wrong and I'm sorry. He would do more for people's trust in science if he did that. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3623.2s)]
*  He's totally incapable of that because he's a freaking sociopath, dangerous human being. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3628.3199999999997s)]
*  He's a shitty pitcher too. You see that? Quite a shitty pitcher. And I say that as a shitty [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3632.3999999999996s)]
*  pitcher, but even I, he's got little dwarf arms, but still. Sorry. No, it's okay, man. Look at this. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3636.16s)]
*  Let's show this shit, bro. God, get fucked. That dude is out of his mind. He's got a mask on outside. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3643.9199999999996s)]
*  Huh? Dude, that guy's got fucking. But it's so prima facie retarded. It's like there's a dwarf [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3651.76s)]
*  on the field with a mask on outside throwing it at the bat boy. Like this is not a real country. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3658.48s)]
*  If that guy's running it, this is, this is a joke. First of all, the bat boy is 11. So he's flirting [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3665.28s)]
*  with a child. So let's call that he's flirting with a child. Let's call it a freak. Now half of [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3670.1600000000003s)]
*  America needs a Tommy John surgery in their heart. Cause it is dude, myocarditis right there. And [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3675.6800000000003s)]
*  there I am with a fucking slider boy. You don't even dick around, do you? Is that you? I've done [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3680.4s)]
*  some things, but no, not on this. Where is that? That was St. Louis, but actually I got to throw [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3685.84s)]
*  one out for the diamond backs. That's why I'm wearing this Jersey. How nervous were you? [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3692.96s)]
*  I was pretty nervous. I guess it suddenly makes you feel like how old you are. You're like, [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3698.0s)]
*  fuck, I'm getting old. How old were you? I'm 40. Oh, I was 41 and I'm 43, but I was like, [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3702.2400000000002s)]
*  oh shit. 43 is pretty old. Yeah. It feels old sometimes. Actually does it feel old? [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3708.16s)]
*  No, it just feels old when you're running upstairs. Yeah. Yeah. I know. What I'm talking about. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3713.12s)]

*  Company. Great cigarette in a red pack. And we had many. So that's, I don't even know if there's a [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3772.72s)]

*  cigarette of my childhood. He picked him up in the Marine Corps when he was 17. I guess they came in [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3784.7999999999997s)]
*  as K-Rash in the end. That was the cigarette of my childhood. There was always one smoldering [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3789.04s)]
*  in an ashtray in our kitchen and everywhere else. Anyway, but I was, I was like, when I was little, [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3794.4s)]
*  I was against it. And my father really loved cigarettes and he wasn't embarrassed of it. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3799.52s)]
*  It wasn't like I smoke, but I feel bad about it. He was like, no, when I smoke on filters, [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3805.12s)]
*  because you feel strip them when you're done, there's no filter. You smoke them backwards. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3809.52s)]
*  So the enemy doesn't know it's an American cigarette. You burn the logo off the, off the paper. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3814.08s)]
*  He, yeah, he really liked cigarettes and he felt sorry for people who didn't smoke. So [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3821.36s)]
*  I was like maybe 13. I was in eighth grade when I started and it was, it was totally. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3826.0s)]

*  with a teacher. I know it sounds like it was in the 1800s. Romantic, I think it was romantic. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3841.44s)]
*  It was great. It's just sneak. It sounds like espionage. No, no, no. It was totally open. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3846.48s)]

*  I probably should. Yeah. It'll probably get me anyway, but I did enjoy it. I really did. I never [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3881.68s)]

*  consumer product, but a cigarette is remarkably consistent and it gives you what it promises you. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3897.2s)]
*  The payoff is always there. That's a good point. Yeah. The payoff is always there. You know, [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3905.12s)]
*  especially that first fucking drag off in the morning, in the morning. You know, what I loved [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3909.3599999999997s)]
*  was they had a man in our area and it was actually my grandmother was married to a man and he would [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3914.0s)]
*  light his cigarette and he would let us inhale the lit smoke up our nose. And we're really young. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3924.16s)]
*  Louisiana is the best, isn't it? God, it was fucking good. I think it's at the highest smoking rate [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3930.72s)]
*  of any state. You know what Louisiana does have? It has the most people that are born there that die [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3934.96s)]
*  there that never leave there. I believe that it's a cool place. It's not like every other place, [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3939.68s)]
*  actually. No dude. It is. Yeah. I always say like New Orleans, it's a good place to get oysters and [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3945.2s)]
*  murdered. Yeah, you get murdered and oysters. That's totally right. The thing about Louisiana, [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3950.8s)]
*  it never gets credit for. Everyone talks about diversity in the melting pot. Like Louisiana [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3955.44s)]
*  actually was that long before most places. Yeah. It was you had a bunch of different cultures there [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3959.04s)]
*  and they kind of got along, you know, sort of anyway. You still got a good mix down there. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3965.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. We had an area bus called Chafuncta. That was the river and it was named after the Chafuncta [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3970.1600000000003s)]
*  Indians. Chafuncta? Yep. Is that like the Fagawi tribe? I'm not sure. That's not a real, that cannot [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3974.88s)]
*  be a real name. That's a real name. T-C-H-E-F. Chafuncta? Yep. Yeah. Chafuncta. It does sound [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3980.24s)]
*  like a joke right there in Louisiana. Yeah. It sounds like a play on words. Yeah, it does. Well, [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3988.0s)]
*  here's how they got the name. A long time ago, a Native American threw a big rock into the river [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3993.7599999999998s)]
*  and that's the sound when it made when it went in. Oh, that's so cool. Is that true? Yeah. True [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=3999.9199999999996s)]
*  story. It's pretty fascinating. But that right there is a perfect example. Louisiana to me is that [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4006.48s)]
*  it's a place for great storytelling. It's a great place for kind of a family. Yep. You know, so [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4012.08s)]
*  that's one story I like to tell about that place. People have dinners with their families there. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4019.84s)]
*  People have 90 minute lunch breaks. People wake up, get to breakfast and then do two or three [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4023.2s)]
*  things before they go to lunch. I love that. Yeah, it was part of it was just that's how life was. It [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4028.56s)]
*  was. It wasn't all about efficiency. No, it wasn't. So if your life is all about efficiency [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4033.28s)]
*  and every moment is being monitored and counts towards something, then you're not really human. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4038.96s)]
*  You're a machine at that point, aren't you? I mean, you're a cog in a larger machine. And that's [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4043.6800000000003s)]
*  what I think a lot of people feel like these days. Well, and for good reason. There's some chick on [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4047.92s)]
*  the internet, 22 year old experiencing life in the corporate world for the first time. And she does [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4051.36s)]
*  this video like this is terrible. I don't make any money. And they treat me like shit and treat me [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4057.28s)]
*  like, you know, I'm not worth anything. I'm not human. And everyone's like, shut up and work, [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4060.4s)]
*  honey. And I watch this and I'm like, no, no, I hope you win. I hope you win. I hope you. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4064.64s)]
*  The seeds of revolution are sprouting in my heart. I just so hate that culture. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4075.84s)]
*  Oh, yeah. It treats people like they're not people. Like for what? Yeah. Well, I mean, [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4080.2400000000002s)]
*  I think for some people in my own sense, learning to be a boss and leader has been tough [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4086.8s)]
*  just because I never I know, you know, I just started out wanting to be a comedian. I wanted [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4091.6000000000004s)]
*  to sleep in, of course, and masturbate and go a lot, right? Be chatty. I didn't get crazy with it. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4095.6800000000003s)]
*  OK, I didn't like. Yeah, I was kind of compulsive for anything. No, no, I was an organized [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4101.92s)]
*  OK, yeah, just good. OK, that's fair. Yeah. One off kind of guy. Yeah. Kind of like when they play [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4107.52s)]
*  the trumpet in the morning. You never got greedy, though. You never went back. Never were greedy. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4112.56s)]
*  I was like, that's it. Yeah. But so I think learning to do that personally has been a little [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4116.48s)]
*  it's been a journey for me. But yeah, I think with with with companies, it's like, how do we get away [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4121.76s)]
*  from that? And is it just sometimes I think America was just this Christian experiment. Yes. That got [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4126.24s)]
*  compromised and has turned out poorly. You think it's like I think you're onto something. And I [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4132.32s)]
*  hate to say that because a part of me doesn't really want to admit it. What's obviously true. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4137.84s)]
*  It's obviously true. I mean, you can't have a democracy unless it's a voluntary system. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4142.4s)]
*  People have to show a lot of restraint. They have to be all in. There has to be some sense [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4147.04s)]
*  of the common good. You can't just be like, how much can I grab? It's like Halloween. It doesn't [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4151.36s)]
*  work if all the kids just empty the basket on the front steps, you know, in the first wave of trick [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4156.48s)]
*  or treaters. No, it's true, though. No, you're right. And a democracy is very much the same way [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4162.0s)]
*  because you can take power and then just like steal everybody's money legally. And so you really [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4165.599999999999s)]
*  have to have some boundaries that you impose on yourself. And if and that has to come from within, [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4171.6s)]
*  you have to have the sense that someone more powerful, like I hate to use the word, but God [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4177.68s)]
*  is watching. And if you don't have that, then it just descends into greed and selfishness, [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4182.320000000001s)]
*  which is where we are now. Have we let because it's the do you think America is still a Christian [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4187.52s)]
*  nation? No, no. What is it? It's an LLC, as you said. So brilliantly, actually, again, [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4191.92s)]
*  we've been privatized communism. It feels like to me, it's exactly right. I mean, I don't know [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4200.24s)]
*  one's for the free market. Everyone's for using power to hobble their competitors. You know, [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4204.96s)]
*  everyone's into the only reason we have regulations is to create monopolies. The system is completely [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4211.92s)]
*  rigged. And you know that you're asking how do you get reliable information about the news? [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4217.599999999999s)]
*  The news media want to talk about race. That's like their main thing that they want to talk about [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4222.639999999999s)]
*  black, white, Hispanic, Asian. But that's actually not an interesting conversation because you can't [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4227.28s)]
*  change your race and like people are different races and they're sort of different, but they're [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4232.56s)]
*  also very much the same. It's like not that interesting a topic to me personally. I'm not [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4235.6s)]
*  interested in talking about race. What's really interesting is that the United States of America [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4240.24s)]
*  is being looted by a small number of people who are getting away with it. And they don't want to [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4244.4800000000005s)]
*  talk about that. They never want to talk about economics. They never want to talk about the tax [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4248.16s)]
*  code. They never want to talk about any of that stuff ever. And that's how you know that CNBC and [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4251.52s)]
*  CNN and the New York Times, all these people are like looking out for you are actually just [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4258.080000000001s)]
*  a Praetorian guard standing in front of the people with the most power and money and keeping the [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4262.320000000001s)]
*  masses from asking uncomfortable questions. And so whenever anyone asks about like, well, wait a [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4267.120000000001s)]
*  second, you know, why do we tax people at half the rate for investing that we do for working? [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4272.64s)]
*  Literally, they pay half the tax rate. So you have a job and you work every day and like, and you pay [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4279.04s)]
*  one rate, but if you just stay home and invest money and live off the interest, you pay half as much. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4284.32s)]
*  So are we saying it's twice as virtuous to invest as it is to work? Is that what we're saying? [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4289.44s)]
*  So if you're a day trader or just trading stocks or something, you don't have to pay those taxes. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4295.5199999999995s)]
*  Or if you're a private equity guy and you can claim that your income is actually investment, [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4298.5599999999995s)]
*  interest is interest on your investments, you pay half the taxes. So we have a, we have a tax code [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4303.04s)]
*  that discourages work and encourages parasitic behavior. Now there are arguments on both sides, [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4308.16s)]
*  and I'm not an economist, but you don't even hear those arguments because it's like, shut up, racism, [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4315.84s)]
*  yeah, trannies or whatever. It's all a distraction from what the real story is, which is they're [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4321.04s)]
*  looting the country. And at this point, you know, we can't repay the debt that we owe. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4326.8s)]
*  So it's going to be like, well, unfortunately we had to sell Yellowstone. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4331.68s)]
*  And no, I mean, it's going to get to the point where we're all sold it to Asians. No, no, for [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4335.68s)]
*  real. Yeah. Where we're, I mean, what is, they're going to say the sale was racist too. That's going [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4340.0s)]
*  to be the craziest part. You're asking questions about it as racist. Okay. Yeah. You're always the [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4344.24s)]
*  race. Just to be clear, you're always the racist Louisiana man. It wasn't David Duke for Louisiana. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4348.8s)]
*  Shut up, Klansman. Yeah. I used to live way to David Duke in prison. No, I can see you guys [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4355.28s)]
*  in the yard area, all the area nation guys. He's like on your back as you're doing pushups. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4360.96s)]
*  Well, I was never in any area nation, dude, you know, not even in prison. No, I never even [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4367.04s)]
*  went to any other meetings or anything. I saw pamphlets or whatever, but I never pulled up over [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4372.4s)]
*  there. But yeah, we shared a back fence and he used to date this hot girl that worked at a seafood [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4378.08s)]
*  restaurant that I worked at. And so he'd pop in there and I'd watch him eat shrimp or whatever, [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4383.52s)]
*  but it was a seafood restaurant. It was called Morton's seafood in Madisonville, right on the [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4388.08s)]
*  chip, the river worked over there, baby. And I was a bus boy and they used to have raccoons coming [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4393.28s)]
*  out the wall when they'd cook duck. The boarding was bad on the wall. It had rotted out and they'd [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4398.4800000000005s)]
*  let one of us bus boys get there with a, uh, with a broomstick. We'd have to stand there and beat [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4403.04s)]
*  the raccoons back in their ferocious animals. Well, they love duck, of course they do. And pizza. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4407.4400000000005s)]
*  Oh really? Oh yeah. Wow. You call them trash pandas where I live and you see them outside [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4412.16s)]
*  in the trash cans. Oh yeah. And they love pizza. I like pizza. Oh yeah. Unfortunately. And oh yeah, [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4416.56s)]
*  you have pizza and you, you know, yeah, they go crazy. I'd love to see now that that would be a [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4421.76s)]
*  good day. Portnoy thing where he gives up. He does one bite to a hit a cone with a bite, you know, [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4426.56s)]
*  but have you ever seen a raccoon eat? You never gave him any duck digit. Oh, I pulled up on them [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4431.360000000001s)]
*  and they're always like this. We didn't do it. The gayest one is the one in the recycling bin. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4435.6s)]
*  He's always like, you know, at least the other ones are in the trash. There's always that [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4442.72s)]
*  one that kind of wanders up the recycle bin and he's wearing like a negligee. Hey, your mom's [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4447.360000000001s)]
*  or something like, what the fuck is that one been doing? You know? But yeah, they always are like [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4452.240000000001s)]
*  plead innocent or whatever. No, they do. They're so clever. I love them. Oh, they're crafty. Yeah. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4457.52s)]
*  I've never shot one. I've seen them so many times in the woods. There they are. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4463.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, they love dog food. Yeah, that's, that's kind of a mangy one. I've seen, we have big ones where [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4466.5599999999995s)]
*  I live. Yeah. I grew up around a lot of rabies. So when, when we come down the street, we'd all [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4473.839999999999s)]
*  have to go inside. Do a lot of people have rabies where you grew up? Yeah, I would say it was, [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4477.839999999999s)]
*  there was a big scare of it. When was rabies popular? Can you look that up? When was rabies [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4482.16s)]
*  popular? Oh, when I was a kid, it was a big thing. Get out the street, you know, there's a sick [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4487.759999999999s)]
*  raccoon or, and, um. But when they got cars and electricity and stuff, they fixed all that. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4491.84s)]
*  I mean, they just, it wasn't as big of a thing. But, um, but yeah, David Duke, man, we would go [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4498.64s)]
*  to the gym sometimes and I'll say this, nice guy. Yeah. I never met him. Nice guy. You know, he never, [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4502.56s)]
*  you know, we just did chest and tris or whatever. There was never any racial things or whatever, [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4509.84s)]
*  you know, but he was a very fit man. I've never met him, but I will say this, and I'm not saying [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4515.2s)]
*  he's a fed though. He's obviously a fed, but every time I would get a new show, [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4519.52s)]
*  I don't know anything about David Duke. I'm from La Jolla, California. He wasn't quite as popular [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4524.0s)]
*  there. Can we find another picture with that? But every time I get a new show, there would be some [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4528.160000000001s)]
*  news story. David Duke endorses Tucker Carlson. Why you, I don't know you. I don't know anything [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4534.240000000001s)]
*  about you. I'm from La Jolla. Okay. We don't share a common culture. Yeah. I'm from Mitt Romney [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4541.4400000000005s)]
*  country. 100%. Literally, Mitt Romney goes to La Jolla. Comedy store, Comedy store La Jolla [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4547.36s)]
*  is one of my favorite. No way. My favorite comedy club in the whole country. It's been there a long [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4552.16s)]
*  time. It's the best club. Since I was a child. Really? Up in the village. Yeah. Yeah. In fact, [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4555.679999999999s)]
*  there was a Jack in the box next door that I used to ride my bike to. I remember that Jack. It wasn't, [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4559.92s)]
*  it was maybe disappeared a few years ago if it did. They closed it down for a while because they [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4565.679999999999s)]
*  had caught selling kangaroo meat. Oh yeah. In the 70s. And I don't, I don't know if that story was [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4569.36s)]
*  actually true, but that's what everyone in the town thought. I mean, look, if you can get a [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4574.56s)]
*  fucking couple grams of roux in La Jolla. Roux burgers. That's what we call them. That's so funny. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4578.96s)]
*  If you took a close look at the meat, it was gray and kind of grisly and it was not beef. I mean, [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4583.6s)]
*  I, and I think the company was owned by Ralston Purina at one point. Oh yeah. And they're out of, [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4590.080000000001s)]
*  I believe they're out of, are they? I think. Yeah. I know they're out of the Midwest. But yeah, [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4595.200000000001s)]
*  I loved it over there. You would always hear, I love La Jolla. It's a beautiful area. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4600.96s)]
*  They weren't big on racism there when I was a kid. Yeah. I don't know. Yeah. I don't know [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4605.4400000000005s)]
*  if they hit. Well, it's mostly white there. Well, that's why they're not big on racism. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4609.4400000000005s)]
*  Right. Yeah. And like people are expecting that we can't do it. No, it was like rich white people. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4613.12s)]
*  Oh yeah. Rich white people. Oh yeah. No, it seemed like rich people. Yeah, for sure. Yeah. It's like, [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4617.68s)]
*  yeah, you feel rich even when you're driving by or you feel like people want you to leave. I feel [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4622.0s)]
*  like it was, it's beautiful there. Yeah. It's really pretty. It's very beautiful. Sad though, [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4627.44s)]
*  soulless. Is it? Yes. Yeah. No soul at all. No one had a last name. I mean, it was obviously it's [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4631.44s)]
*  one of the prettiest places in the world, but yeah, it was, you know, hi, I'm Bob. I'm a Sagittarius. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4637.759999999999s)]
*  Like nobody had a real connection to anyone else. Everyone's just kind of passing through. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4643.28s)]
*  And the first time I went to New Orleans, which is obviously a disgusting place, but I loved it [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4647.44s)]
*  because it was so, it was just so thick. It was just so much there and all these weird rituals [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4652.56s)]
*  and customs and just had a culture. And I just didn't grow up around that at all. And even though [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4659.04s)]
*  I didn't understand what they were doing in New Orleans and obviously I was very threatened by it [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4663.360000000001s)]
*  because like half the town is a violent criminal, right? But I still liked it because I thought [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4667.4400000000005s)]
*  this is interesting in a way that nothing I grew up with was interesting at all. I could totally [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4674.400000000001s)]
*  see that. Yeah. I think I grew up in a place that was just so, you know, it was just, there was so [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4679.28s)]
*  much lore and stuff in our area that, and I think that's just a lot of the way that Louisiana was. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4683.2s)]
*  Amos Moses. From Louisiana? I don't know, but I love that song. But you just picked, you know, [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4689.44s)]
*  wrestling alligators in the swamp and where I grew up, people literally talked about the weather [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4694.8s)]
*  every single day, every day. And the weather never changed. It wasn't like we lived in Minnesota or [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4698.96s)]
*  something. It's very Truman show there in the world. It's unbelievable. You'd be like, well, [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4703.92s)]
*  it's going to be 72 and partly cloudy moving to mostly sunny in the afternoon. It's going to be [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4708.48s)]
*  68 overnight tomorrow. And it would just be on an endless repeat. It was a skipping record. Did you [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4713.84s)]
*  hate that about yourself? That like, like, was there any self like load? Because like I hated [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4718.5599999999995s)]
*  myself because I was poor, right? But does that happen on the other end of the spectrum? Or and [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4725.2s)]
*  I hated my neighborhood. I just felt embarrassed, right? Like, does that happen on the other end [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4730.88s)]
*  of the spectrum where people? No, not enough. There should be a lot more self hatred in rich [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4736.64s)]
*  neighborhoods. I hate to say self hatred. Sorry. I was ashamed of myself. That's a better way. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4740.88s)]
*  There should be more shame. It should be more shame. Like if you've amassed a hundred million [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4744.96s)]
*  dollars from sucking the last remaining lifeblood out of some manufacturing company in the Midwest, [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4749.6s)]
*  calling it private equity, like you should hate yourself a little bit. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4756.400000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? And there's none of that. And I think that's part of the problem. There's [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4760.240000000001s)]
*  not enough guilt among the ruling class. There's no sense of obligation to people beneath them. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4764.48s)]
*  And that's one of the reasons they hate them so much. And that's one of the reasons [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4769.839999999999s)]
*  that the fentanyl crisis has not even been acknowledged by Washington is because they [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4773.2s)]
*  kind of know they're responsible for it. And you wind up hating the people you've wronged. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4777.44s)]
*  I have noticed. Like, what do you mean that you might wind up hating it? If you commit a sin [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4782.0s)]
*  against somebody, if you're cruel to somebody, unfair to somebody, you cheat somebody, you wind [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4786.4s)]
*  up hating that person as a way of justifying what you did. And the only way to stop that is by [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4790.64s)]
*  admitting what you did and saying it out loud to the person's face and asking for his forgiveness, [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4796.0s)]
*  which again is why the 12 step model works. Right? But if you don't do that, you wind up blaming the [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4801.12s)]
*  person for the crime that you committed against him. And that's one of the reasons that people [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4806.72s)]
*  who don't get sober are so angry at the world. They're pissed at their parents. You meet these [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4810.72s)]
*  people, their parents send them to rehab six times and they're pissed at their parents. Why are you [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4814.8s)]
*  mad at your parents? They did everything they could. And the reason that junkies mad at his [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4819.12s)]
*  parents is because he knows that he's actually the guilty party and he's committed massive crimes [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4824.0s)]
*  against them, but he can't admit it. So he blames them. And that is true at a macro level as well. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4829.76s)]
*  And if you're ruling class of all the richest people have gotten rich by dicking over the [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4835.36s)]
*  people beneath them, running these fascist companies that spy on their employees' phone [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4839.84s)]
*  calls and like track them as they come in and out of the building and require them to work on [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4845.28s)]
*  Sundays with no overtime and just really inhumane sweatshop type practices, creepy Stasi stuff. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4849.5199999999995s)]
*  Those people end up having great contempt for their own employees. Do you know what I mean? [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4855.36s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I think it's one of the spaces we're getting to right now in the country is people, [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4860.639999999999s)]
*  if you're an owner of something, if you are a, well, you know, what's interesting is when you [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4864.4s)]
*  say that I recently met a guy who was a Democrat, right? He's like a devout Democrat, [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4870.56s)]
*  right? And he said to me, this was interesting. I never heard this. He said, you know, I vote [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4875.92s)]
*  for Democrats because I want there to be programs in place to keep the people that [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4879.92s)]
*  are struggling. I want to keep them at, I want to satiate them just enough so they don't rebel. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4888.8s)]
*  They don't have power. Right. And I'd never heard that. I always [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4896.240000000001s)]
*  wowed. Yeah. He said that to me and I was like, that's so I never heard that. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4899.6s)]
*  Here's your weed. Here's your porn. Just don't make a mess. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4904.160000000001s)]
*  Just don't make a mess so that the rest of us who don't, who aren't as unfortunate as you [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4907.280000000001s)]
*  can still operate like we operate. Okay. So I just never heard that perspective. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4912.96s)]
*  Was this on camera? No, this was just in a human conversation. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4918.4800000000005s)]
*  There's two humans eating an inhuman conversation. Really? [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4921.4400000000005s)]
*  What? Yeah. I have salad. I don't know what he had. We're having lunch. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4925.76s)]
*  The blood of children probably sounds that way. He had an O negative. Yeah. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4930.240000000001s)]
*  I mean, that is so dark, but it's so true. And by the way, bless him for his honesty, [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4937.280000000001s)]
*  because that is exactly what's going on. And that's not how you treat your own kids or people you [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4941.200000000001s)]
*  love. Right. You'd never say I'm going to keep you on just enough assistance that you cannot starve to [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4944.88s)]
*  death, but that you'll be like so harried by the shittiness of your existence that you'll never [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4950.240000000001s)]
*  challenge my power. Like that is a crime. I've never heard that. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4956.08s)]
*  Well, that's the plan. Well, to me as an American value, [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4960.64s)]
*  that was like, oh, that's never a way that I ever would thought or think. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4963.92s)]
*  No, because you encourage self-sufficiency because that's where self-respect comes from. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4967.92s)]
*  I've got my shit in a pile and I'm proud of myself. That's the goal for an adult man. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4971.04s)]
*  And if you're preventing people from getting to that, then you are committing a crime and you [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4976.08s)]
*  should be held accountable for it in my opinion. But there's nobody to hold anybody accountable [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4981.04s)]
*  anymore. It feels like. I know. Well, I'm very aware of that. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4984.32s)]
*  Everyone's in on it. Well, it's just so interesting. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4987.679999999999s)]
*  How do we get out of it then? By saying the truth out loud. I think that's the only recourse. I [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4990.719999999999s)]
*  think that's more powerful than guns. I mean, I do saying truth. I mean, that's what they get [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=4995.599999999999s)]
*  hysterical about. There'll be a mass shooting and they'll be three days. We need to take all our [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5000.48s)]
*  guns away. They're not going to take your guns away. Okay. Because they can't, but that's not [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5005.36s)]
*  their priority. But when somebody says something that's true, I mean, they will disappear a person [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5008.72s)]
*  for that. Like you'll never hear from them again. And there's a reason. The reason is nothing is a [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5014.64s)]
*  greater threat to the people running things than true words. And that's why they're called Kanye. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5020.72s)]
*  I'm not talking about what Kanye was disappeared. I mean, and my view of Kanye would be, [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5028.320000000001s)]
*  you know, if you show up on Alex Jones in a hockey mask saying you love Hitler, [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5033.52s)]

*  if you actually wanted to promote Hitler and I hope no one would ever want to promote Hitler. But [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5054.4800000000005s)]
*  like, if you did, that would not be the way to do it. Yeah. Right. So actually, how is Kanye a [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5058.400000000001s)]
*  threat to anybody? I don't think he was. Yeah. And by the way, he's a recording artist. He's a [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5063.6s)]
*  musician. So like in a clothing designer, he's not in charge of federal policy. So I did think, [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5069.76s)]
*  yeah, I thought that was distressing. Just because I don't think anybody should be silenced. If [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5077.68s)]
*  you're not committing violence against somebody, you have the right as a human being, because you [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5083.04s)]

*  human being. You're a slave. Like that's the acid test. Am I a slave or not? I don't know. One simple [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5096.08s)]
*  question. Can you say what you really think? And if you can't, then you're a slave. Super simple. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5101.28s)]

*  anything anymore. It's like, Hey, just put in kind of how you feel. We'll write what you, what [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5120.32s)]

*  and screenplays and like giving me a fake father, you know, but upgrade or no, a little younger [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5142.4s)]

*  like them both, but like nobody cares. But there are big important countries around the world and [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5626.16s)]
*  they're very focused on the United States and they have all these views about what we're doing. And [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5631.44s)]
*  those views are never expressed here. So if you're a leader in the United States, you can be like, [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5634.88s)]
*  well, we're doing this for democracy. This is the arsenal of democracy. And then you go to the [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5640.64s)]
*  countries that are directly affected by those policies and they're like, you're freaking insane. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5646.0s)]
*  You have no idea what you're talking about. I mean, the mindblower for me this summer, [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5649.28s)]
*  we traveled all over the world, much different continents and we're still doing it because I [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5653.36s)]
*  got fired. So I, I've been stuck in a studio for all those years. Now you got to get out and about. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5657.36s)]
*  Well, kind of. I mean, I go on vacation for two weeks a year, but that was it. You know, when you [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5661.76s)]
*  do, well, you do a show regularly. It's, you're tied to where you are, period. You're in a studio. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5666.16s)]
*  Yeah. So all of a sudden I'm like, wow, I'm kind of free emancipated. Yeah. For a few months. And [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5672.16s)]
*  it was the summertime. And anyway, so we wouldn't, but the shock for me was, and this is not a [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5676.4800000000005s)]
*  partisan point at all, at all. And what does partisan mean? It means like carrying water for a party. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5682.0s)]
*  Like this is what Republicans think or Democrats think. So nonpartisan means not choosing. This is [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5686.96s)]
*  just what I think is true. And like, it doesn't matter what the either party says. Okay. What does [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5690.8s)]
*  nonpartisan mean? It just means not partisan. It's not, you're not connected to a party. You're not [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5694.4800000000005s)]
*  helping either party. Okay. But what I mean is both parties, Republican and Democrat, were saying for [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5699.76s)]
*  a year and a half, Ukraine is winning this war against Russia. Yeah. I remember hearing that. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5706.08s)]
*  Oh yeah. I mean, and I still think people believe that. So whatever you think of the war, Russia, [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5710.56s)]
*  Ukraine, I mean, you know, I'm not that interested honestly, cause I'm not Russian or Ukrainian is [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5714.72s)]
*  the truth. But lots of Americans seem to be interested in they have their little Ukrainian [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5718.72s)]
*  flags and they're learning to pronounce Kiev as Keev and they're doing all the steps that you need [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5722.56s)]
*  to do. Repeating all the dumb slogans. Slava Ukraine. Yeah. They don't, you know, whatever. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5727.52s)]
*  Americans have this thing where they have no idea where something is, but they're like, oh, [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5733.04s)]
*  I'm a, you see it now with the Middle East, but I'm an expert. You know, it's like the Nakba. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5735.84s)]
*  What? Yeah. Stop. But anyway, but the article of faith for most Americans was that Ukraine is [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5739.92s)]
*  winning this war. So I mean, I don't know. How do I know? You know what I mean? I'm stuck in a studio. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5746.0s)]
*  So I go over to the region, two different countries aboard a Ukraine. Oh, you popped over [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5750.88s)]
*  there to Ukraine. No, no, I didn't go to Ukraine. No, I don't think I'd do well in Ukraine. No, [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5755.36s)]
*  they really, well, the government Ukraine is like, attacked me by name a lot. So I felt like that [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5759.12s)]
*  was unwise. Who's their master over there, their leader. Well, the president is a guy called [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5763.28s)]
*  Vladimir Zelensky. Oh, right. That's right. He's a fucking comedian. Yeah. A very unfunny one. Yeah. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5769.52s)]
*  Do we have any videos of him doing standup comedy? He's got one where he's playing the [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5775.44s)]
*  piano with his dick. I don't know if you can find that. Oh, really? Yeah. But yeah. And actually [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5780.32s)]
*  fairly well. Was it at a SIG app house? Where was that? It was in Ukraine somewhere. Oh, no way. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5785.36s)]
*  I think that's, yeah, it's a pretty common thing. There. Oh, there he is playing piano with his [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5790.16s)]
*  penis. Yes. Is he really? Oh, yes. Oh, anybody can be president now. Well, I don't know. Can you play [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5796.08s)]
*  the piano with your penis? A little bit of ball toven. That's kind of hacky, but it's cute though. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5807.28s)]
*  That was good. I like that. I said that just because I knew you might like it. I love that. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5817.2s)]
*  I wish I'd said that. But anyway, so whatever, I don't care about these guys in any way. But [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5823.28s)]
*  I go over there and I start talking to very knowledgeable people, like the people who run [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5829.599999999999s)]
*  these countries. And they're like, what? No, Russia has a hundred million more people than Ukraine. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5832.4s)]
*  A hundred million. Wow. And much deeper industrial capacity. They have all these weapons factories. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5839.12s)]
*  You're not going to, it's the largest country in the world by landmass. There's no, literally no [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5843.28s)]
*  chance even theoretically Ukraine could beat them. But aren't they an industrial old, aren't they? [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5847.599999999999s)]
*  Aren't they like, you know, things made out of stone. Aren't they like living in the past with [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5852.88s)]
*  a lot of like techno, like, well, it turns out, I mean, there's the military advanced. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5857.599999999999s)]
*  Well, we always made fun of it, you know, during the Soviet period because it was super inefficient [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5862.0s)]
*  and they were all drunk and they would crash their commercial airliners all the time from [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5866.16s)]
*  drunkenness all the time. In fact, a famous, their plane, their carrier, the international carrier, [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5869.92s)]
*  their national carrier is called Aeroflot, Russian carrier was the Soviet carrier. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5875.2s)]
*  And in a very, very famous crash, the pilot had his son in the cockpit with passengers on the plane [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5879.44s)]
*  and the cockpit voice recorder proved this and the son just takes the yoke, [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5886.4s)]
*  just pushes it down and flies the plane right into the ground. So like people made fun [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5891.599999999999s)]
*  correctly of Soviet technology, but it turns out they were actually pretty good at this. You know, [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5896.639999999999s)]
*  they produced a lot of chess players. They're not stupid people at all. And now they're the [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5902.08s)]
*  Ukrainians for that matter. But anyway, the point is the Russians were never going to lose period. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5905.6s)]
*  And anyone who looked at it objectively would know that except no one in the United States knew that. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5911.84s)]
*  So that kind of freaked me out. I'm like, we have a big country, smart country, very, the most [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5916.56s)]
*  advanced country in the world, supposedly. And nobody even knows a basic fact. Like Russia has [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5920.160000000001s)]
*  a hundred million more people, of course, they're not going to lose to Ukraine. Like that's insane. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5926.320000000001s)]
*  And yet nobody knew that. So I thought, wow, what else don't we know? You know, and like the amount [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5930.16s)]
*  of lying that you can do in a world where everything is controlled, all information is [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5936.799999999999s)]
*  controlled, with the exception pretty much of Twitter, because the guy who owns it has said he's [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5941.919999999999s)]
*  not going to censor. Yeah, it's nice. I feel like that's one thing that I thought was that, [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5946.4s)]
*  yeah, maybe that's it. That's what's about censorship is at least you feel like you can [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5951.679999999999s)]
*  say things or that things can be shared on there because didn't you feel, I mean, as someone who [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5955.36s)]
*  writes comedy, who does this every day, do you feel freer on the platform now? [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5964.5599999999995s)]
*  On Twitter? Yeah. I feel like at least if YouTube takes me down. Oh, look at that. Comedy is legal [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5972.32s)]
*  on this platform. So Elon like specifically endorsed your right to say it. Yeah, it was nice [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5978.32s)]
*  and we had Roseanne Barr on and she's a I like her a lot. Oh, dude, she fucking did so much [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5982.96s)]
*  for a comedy. She did so much for women and gays. And oh, wait, I saw part of that. And they, [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5988.64s)]
*  Hollywood threw under the fucking bus as soon as they had a chance because they are [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=5996.32s)]
*  heartless. And, and so anyway, she was on my show and she saw that. And they took tell me if I'm [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6000.56s)]
*  misremembering this, they took a line that she had and they cut out all the context and put it [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6008.0s)]
*  like on TikTok and it made her sound like she was a crazy person or a vicious person, which she's [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6013.76s)]
*  not either. Yeah, she's a Jewish. I mean, she was born Jewish. I think she's still Jewish, right? [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6018.24s)]
*  She is. And so she said, yeah, oh, and the Holocaust never happened, right? She said sarcastically, [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6022.56s)]
*  right? Of course. I think she had relatives who died in it. Yes. Yeah, very obvious, right? Of [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6030.0s)]
*  course. And they, some guy on Twitter, asshole Sam, I don't know what the guy's name was, [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6035.12s)]
*  something's, Fuckelstein or somebody. He fucking made a big deal about it. Oh, for the Minneapolis [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6041.36s)]
*  Fuckelsteins. Yeah, probably. I know them. This dude, this was two weeks after, right? Makes a big [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6046.64s)]
*  deal about, or just put that clip in or whatever, no context. So then YouTube took us down, took [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6051.599999999999s)]
*  that episode down, but we got to put it on Twitter. So that was nice, at least because it was an [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6056.72s)]
*  honest place, you know? But what I worry about is like, didn't some of these companies, didn't [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6061.12s)]
*  Twitter or Facebook, didn't they get in trouble for not letting, like during election times, [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6067.12s)]
*  like not real information being allowed to be shared? Yeah. I mean, I don't know who would get [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6074.88s)]
*  them in trouble. They run everything. And, you know, my concern would be as we're getting to this [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6078.72s)]
*  election, it's very intense. No, I think they're, you know, very intense people on both sides. And [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6084.48s)]
*  if you actually had a platform that was open for everyone to say what he or she thinks, [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6090.4800000000005s)]
*  that's a massive threat to the asshole community. And I think that the, because the truth is always [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6096.4800000000005s)]
*  a threat to liars. That's just right. It never changes. People are killed never for lying, ever. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6102.0s)]
*  They're only killed for telling the truth. You're only punished for telling the truth. People get [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6107.360000000001s)]
*  mad. It's because you told the truth. Everyone should know that. So, I mean, I don't, I can't [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6111.28s)]
*  imagine the pressure that's going to come to bear on this company X now over the next year. I mean, [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6116.08s)]
*  you know, it's going to be without precedent, I think. Do you think Elon could be, I mean, [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6123.76s)]
*  there could be like even an assassination attempt on him or something? I would never speculate [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6128.48s)]
*  about something like that, but I just think there's, but you can't. You're a guy at a bar. What are [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6131.84s)]
*  you going to say? You know, I think there's going to be, I would have a food taster. I mean, I think [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6135.36s)]
*  it's, I think, look, the one, the one thing we, look, if you're doing a great job at something, [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6141.2s)]
*  if you're a great father, great husband, great employer, great comedian, you're not too worried [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6146.72s)]
*  because you know you're doing a good job. But if you're doing a bad job and the only beneficiary [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6152.24s)]
*  of your work is you and everyone else is getting screwed and they can't even afford to fill up their [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6156.639999999999s)]
*  truck or buy groceries and you're still getting rich, you're very worried. Dictators are always [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6161.36s)]
*  worried about their own security. Okay. So what's the biggest threat to you? The biggest threat is [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6167.76s)]
*  someone calling you out. And so you have to shut down any medium where that could possibly happen. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6172.96s)]
*  So obviously Facebook is completely controlled. Google is completely controlled. TikTok, [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6178.0s)]
*  foreign owned company, God knows what their agenda is. So really the only big platform [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6182.8s)]
*  that's pretty not controlled with some, apparently some limits, but in general, it's not controlled. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6187.68s)]
*  It's free speech is X. I agree. So like there's a lot at stake. Legitimate leaders don't worry [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6193.28s)]
*  about this. If I'm a legitimate leader, if I'm a good father and one of my kids is like, I want [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6200.0s)]
*  to smoke weed at the breakfast table. You're like, you can't, sorry. Cause I make the rules, no weed [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6204.16s)]
*  at the breakfast table. I'm not worried about saying that because I think I'm a pretty good father. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6208.5599999999995s)]
*  And I think my kids think I'm a pretty good father. But if I'm a terrible father who's abusing my kids, [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6212.32s)]
*  I can't let them say anything because the authorities might find out. I had to get punished [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6216.8s)]
*  for what they know. And that is the same attitude that every dictator has. That's why all dictators [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6222.4800000000005s)]
*  take the guns and impose censorship is the first thing they do. They don't want to throw you in [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6228.0s)]
*  prison. It's expensive. It's difficult. They don't want to execute you. They just want you to shut [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6231.68s)]
*  up and be obedient. And Elon Musk in buying this platform and opening it up to all positions, [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6235.28s)]
*  even unpopular ones is the single greatest threat to their hegemony, to their control. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6240.4s)]
*  And, you know, I'm not predicting their response, but I mean, it's going to be intense, [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6246.4s)]
*  super intense. I can say that. Do you have security and that sort of thing? If you were him, [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6250.56s)]
*  would you have like somebody, you know, would you make sure that the Tesla truck, which is [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6255.360000000001s)]
*  supposed to have been out for 17 years, but that it has extra bulletproofness in the glass? [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6260.160000000001s)]
*  I would definitely include as a standard feature, not an add on the oil tanks that drop the oil onto [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6265.84s)]
*  the road behind you. So the people pursuing you spin out and like go right into a bridge abutment [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6271.84s)]
*  or off the side of the mountain, off Mulholland. You know what I mean? I would definitely do that. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6276.32s)]
*  And I'd have like hidden machine guns under the side view mirrors. I'd have a death ray possibly. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6281.44s)]
*  That would probably be a custom feature, but I would, I would have stuff like that. Yeah, for sure. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6287.44s)]
*  Do you think we get fair news about like even the war, like in Israel, in Israel and Hamas, [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6291.92s)]
*  like, do you think we get fair information about that? Like Joe Rogan had a lady on recently and [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6296.639999999999s)]
*  she was saying that like the perception of what happens over there isn't the information that we [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6301.84s)]
*  get, you know? Do you see that? Think of it this way. What's at stake? People's lives, control of [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6305.52s)]
*  government's control of land, you know, ancient rivalries and hatreds. I mean, there's so much [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6311.92s)]
*  at stake here. Oh, this is the Celtics and the Lakers from the Bible. That of course, yeah, [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6318.88s)]
*  I mean, it's very intense. And so of course, there's going to be massive lying on all sides [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6322.96s)]
*  and there is and, and that's fine. And you go into it knowing that I've spent a lot of time over there [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6327.76s)]
*  and I will freely confess I don't understand a lot of the dynamics because I'm from La Jolla. I'm not [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6332.72s)]
*  from, you know, Jenin or Jerusalem or Qatar. It's like, I'm not from the region. Okay. I don't speak [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6338.96s)]
*  the languages, but I know enough to know that there's massive lying. And, and I think it's [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6345.68s)]
*  good to know that. The only thing that enrages me is when you hear people say, you know, you must [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6351.6s)]
*  believe me. I have no obligation to believe anybody. You have an obligation if you want me [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6356.88s)]
*  to believe you to prove what you're saying. Right. And I have a right to ask simple, fair questions. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6361.92s)]
*  How do you know that? How can I trust that? How? And if, and if you don't give me those answers, [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6366.16s)]
*  then I just don't believe you. And I don't have to believe you. And if your recourse is you're a bad [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6370.32s)]
*  person for not believing me, fuck you. That's my response. Fuck you. And especially in this case [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6375.12s)]
*  where my money and potentially my children's lives, well, that was a cocaine thing you just did. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6380.72s)]
*  Yeah. One of these things got blown out of my nose every now and then I got to make sure it works. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6385.92s)]
*  Got to open it up. Yeah. I agree with that. Just widen them out. There's no shame. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6389.28s)]
*  God, didn't it feel good? God, dude. If I can feel it dripping down the back of my throat right now. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6394.48s)]
*  Anyway, sorry to use profanity on your show, but somebody put on some Kesha, you know, let's fucking [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6400.0s)]
*  rock. Is that what you listened to? I don't know what happened to. No, be honest. What were you [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6406.5599999999995s)]
*  listening to when you were alone? I think it was probably, yeah, some Kesha, some traveling [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6410.96s)]
*  Willberries, traveling Willberries, maybe a little bit of that's the soundtrack of your private [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6414.88s)]
*  cocaine use. I got a unique list, you know, a little, maybe some Morgan Waller, different, [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6419.68s)]
*  you know, eclectic mix, I think James Blake. What about dust in the baggie, Billy strings? [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6427.28s)]
*  Never heard that. I love Billy strings, but I haven't heard dust in a bag. Oh, [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6432.8s)]
*  it's a great tune. And it's about dust in a baggie. I thought it was an Irish guy, dust in the baggie. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6436.08s)]
*  Okay, that's good. It's good. Hey, dust in mom's pissed. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6441.2s)]
*  Sorry, I'm just have you ever been to Boston? I've been to Pittsburgh, though. Dave Chappelle was [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6450.88s)]
*  just in Boston and you saw what they did to him over there. It's unbelievable. Yeah. Do you think [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6455.36s)]
*  that's fair that they should? Because what's not fair, but it's like, I don't know if you go to [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6459.36s)]
*  listen to Dave Chappelle these days, you know, he's going to talk more about a lot of stuff. [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6464.48s)]
*  You know, he criticizes Israel spars with crowd at Boston show. Oh, he criticized Israel. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6468.4s)]
*  So I didn't know that's exactly what I mean. Look, I wasn't there. I only know what I wasn't there [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6474.799999999999s)]
*  either. But I think he made one point, which I think is entirely, I don't know if I agree. I [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6479.44s)]
*  don't agree with Dave Chappelle on everything, of course. But the one point that I read that I did [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6484.879999999999s)]
*  agree with was the United States is implicated in this. And so we have a right to have an opinion [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6489.5199999999995s)]
*  on it. And that is obviously true. And anyone who tells you don't have a right to have an opinion, [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6493.839999999999s)]
*  or you must have one specific opinion is wrong. And I think it's fair to say that. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6497.6s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. I think that people should be able to have their, um, their opinions, you know? Yeah. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6502.64s)]
*  Because once you don't have your fucking opinion, then it's like, how do you, how do you get to a [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6507.92s)]
*  revolution? How do we get to a revolution? Cause at what point do people just say, well, if my life [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6512.08s)]
*  doesn't, if you don't want my life to mean anything to me, based on how you've set up the [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6518.72s)]
*  environment, at what point do you go from there to, then I am not going to play this game? Or how [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6524.48s)]
*  does a revolution start? They're very worried about it. That's why they're putting people in prison. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6532.879999999999s)]
*  And I think they should be worried about it. They are worried. I'd love to fucking be on a horseback, [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6537.839999999999s)]
*  dude. Well, but you know how you get to a revolution is by not listening to people and not [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6541.599999999999s)]
*  serving their interests and telling them to shut up again and again, calling them names, you know, [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6545.919999999999s)]
*  something you've got a legitimate question like, why should I support a war with Iran? Shut up, [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6550.16s)]
*  calling me Nick. What? No, I have four children of draft age. Like, why is that not a fair question [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6554.24s)]
*  for me? Shut up. And you do that enough. And I have recourse because I have a platform. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6559.52s)]
*  But most people don't. And if you tell them to shut up enough, like we don't care that you care [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6566.56s)]
*  about gas prices in your stupid pickup truck. Well, some people like their pickup trucks and [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6570.8s)]
*  they use them for work. And if it's not affordable to fill it up, that's a big deal for them. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6575.04s)]
*  If you're like, shut up, climate change pig, you know, your nephew ODs on fentanyl and nobody [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6581.2s)]
*  cares. Like, keep that up for long enough. You will make people radical. And why wouldn't they [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6586.48s)]
*  be radical actually? And I'm so insulated for most of it because I have enough money and I'm not in [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6591.68s)]
*  debt and my kids are grown and paid for and like I'm in a much easier position than most people. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6598.24s)]
*  Right. And I feel radical just watching. Right. And so why wouldn't they be on the brink of [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6602.5599999999995s)]
*  being unreasonable? And it doesn't need to be this way. You don't have to solve all [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6609.84s)]
*  people's problems. Like some problems are very hard to solve and people know that there's no [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6613.6s)]
*  magic button you press that ends inflation or stops fentanyl. And everyone knows that. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6617.92s)]
*  All you need to do is express the fact and do it sincerely that you care. You acknowledge these are [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6624.0s)]
*  big problems. But when the speaker of the house who I know is a nice guy from your state, [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6630.240000000001s)]
*  the new speaker of the house comes in and the first thing he does is issue a statement on behalf [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6634.88s)]
*  of foreign country. That's the most important thing. I'm not even against the statement, [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6640.88s)]
*  but I'm just saying like what bigger statement does that make? That's him, Mikey Johnson. Yeah. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6644.32s)]
*  He's the speaker? He is. Praise God. I mean damn, Mikey. He's a nice guy and I'm not against him, [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6650.72s)]
*  but I'm just saying like if you think the welfare of another country is the most important thing for [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6656.5599999999995s)]
*  you as the one of the leaders of our country, third in line to the presidency, you have lost [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6661.36s)]
*  the thread, son, because it's not. Nothing is more important for the leaders of our country [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6666.0s)]
*  than our country and how it's 350 million people are doing. So I was enraged by that. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6671.36s)]
*  And people are like, oh, are you for Hamas? Of course I'm not for Hamas at all. I'm for America, [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6677.679999999999s)]
*  actually. I shouldn't even have to answer that question. Are you for Israel or Hamas? [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6683.2s)]
*  I mean, obviously I'm for Israel over Hamas, but that's irrelevant. I'm for America and no [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6687.12s)]
*  one even asked that. And I feel deep resentment about that, that the concerns of this country [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6693.04s)]
*  are of no concern. Right. Right. It feels like our concerns don't even fucking matter. They don't [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6698.88s)]
*  matter. That's why it makes me wonder, are we just a shell company for Israel? Are we just a shell [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6702.64s)]
*  company for China? Like, where are we anymore? Like, are we just? Well, there are a lot of people [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6706.96s)]
*  who live here who really like it here, who were born here. I love it here. I know you do. And I'm [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6713.12s)]
*  just saying, like, it doesn't have to be this way. You know, there are people, there are hundreds of [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6717.36s)]
*  millions of people whose ancestors are buried here and they want to stay here. They don't have [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6722.24s)]
*  another passport. And it wouldn't be hard to rally them and just say, like, you're a Democrat, you're [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6725.12s)]
*  a Republican, you're this, you're that, but we're all American. And let's have a conversation about [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6730.88s)]
*  what's best for our country. You would get people from all sides being like, that's right. That's [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6735.12s)]
*  the right conversation. We may not even agree, but that's the conversation we should be having. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6739.68s)]
*  And if you don't do that, I'm just telling you, you play with fire. People go crazy. And I'm totally [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6744.400000000001s)]
*  convinced that the mass shootings we're seeing and the massive spike in mental illness that we're [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6750.08s)]
*  seeing, which is leading to the mass shootings, these are manifestations of the frustration, [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6754.08s)]
*  the hopelessness that people feel when they realize their leaders don't care about them. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6759.04s)]
*  I believe that. I can't prove it. But I believe it because I happen to live in a place with a lot of, [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6762.88s)]
*  you know, people who are not kind of succeeding in the modern world. And they're good people and [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6768.8s)]
*  they have skills and they've been here. Their families have been here for hundreds of years. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6772.72s)]
*  We should care about them. I agree. But yeah, I think our country has been compromised by people [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6776.8s)]
*  that don't care and they don't see value in that. And it feels like it's just about a bottom line [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6783.12s)]
*  or it's about, I don't know, some goal that to me seems so erroneous. I can't even fathom [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6793.28s)]
*  that you wouldn't have feelings like when you're like that Sackler family that's just [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6800.5599999999995s)]
*  let watching people's children die. She can make money off of a fucking pill. Who cares? [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6805.2s)]
*  What are you, what are you going to get another like half bathroom or something? Like, what are [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6811.36s)]
*  you going to get? Like, I just, I don't understand the goal sometimes of, of some of that or why [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6815.84s)]
*  people would think that selling someone out to such a point where they don't have any purpose, [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6823.52s)]
*  where you take away their hope, you know, we had a guy on here talking about meaning this guy, [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6828.16s)]
*  John Verbeke. And he was real interesting. This guy is from Canada and he just talks about meaning [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6832.64s)]
*  and when people don't have like, when they don't feel like they're supported by, [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6839.2s)]
*  I'm going to fuck it up, but if they don't feel like they're part of a group or they don't feel [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6846.8s)]
*  like, if they're totally cut off from other people and just floating around atomized and alone, [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6850.639999999999s)]
*  it drives them crazy. Right. You go crazy. Yeah. And then you get an [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6855.36s)]
*  confinement. Exactly. So you've basically taken so much of America by taking away like things that [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6858.88s)]
*  brought us together. And some of those things were smaller towns like businesses in small towns, [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6863.6s)]
*  things that made people feel of value. You know, my, my father went to a, you know, my father, [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6869.68s)]
*  his family was mahogany farmers. They did wood. And so I think if your father went into the woods [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6875.84s)]
*  in your town or whatever part of a company that built tables, literally mahogany farmers. Yeah. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6880.4800000000005s)]
*  And you had a table at home and then your view, it was your dad's company's table. You like, [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6884.4800000000005s)]
*  we eat at our families. We built it in our town, some physical connection between labor and [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6888.160000000001s)]
*  reward and theoretical and digital and bullshit. Yeah. Zoom calls and yeah. Yeah. Now it's just [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6893.28s)]
*  like, do you want to eat at this fucking Chipotle sit go, you know, where they're selling gas and [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6899.12s)]
*  burritos and, you know, and it just like, is that a thing? But that's a fucking town hall of a lot [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6905.2s)]
*  of it's just now everything has just been, it's a dollar general in most towns and that's what it is. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6910.32s)]
*  And you know, it's like this, we've killed off a lot of that, you know, what's interesting is you [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6915.04s)]
*  drive through, I like to hunt and fish. So I've been in a lot of small towns in America because [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6918.88s)]
*  that's where the hunting and the fishing. Oh yeah. And some of these towns and especially the county [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6923.12s)]
*  seats in rural towns have beautiful courthouses, beautiful, like somebody spent a lot of money and [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6927.92s)]
*  a lot of time to make a beautiful public building. One of those hasn't been built since the second [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6934.16s)]
*  world war. That is true. Probably since the thirties, since the depression, your state, [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6939.28s)]
*  especially you've got a lot of great public architecture in Louisiana. None of it has been [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6943.04s)]
*  built since Huey Long was murdered. Okay. So why is that? And it's been replaced by [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6946.96s)]
*  disposable garbage in the dollar store. I'm sorry to single them out, but they are a symbol of it. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6952.32s)]
*  It's so intentionally ugly. Box stores are so ugly. You're like, there's gotta be a purpose [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6957.36s)]
*  behind, you know, architecture exists for a reason. You're sending a message when you build a building, [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6964.4s)]
*  you build anything. And the message of box stores and dollar stores and of public, the DMV is, [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6968.48s)]
*  you mean nothing. We're not going to spend any time or any energy trying to elevate you [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6976.08s)]
*  or please your senses or build anything beautiful. It's ugly on purpose to let you know that you mean [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6981.52s)]
*  nothing. You do not count. Shut up and obey. You're an animal actually. And I just feel like there's [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6988.4800000000005s)]
*  something very profound about that. The message that a sense and everyone receives the message, [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6995.040000000001s)]
*  whether they know it or not, you go into a DMV, what's it telling you? Wait your turn, wait for [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=6999.52s)]
*  your number. And then some surly low IQ person like hassles you over. It's like I'm a citizen [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7006.64s)]
*  of this country. Why do I even have to have a driver's license? Give me my fucking papers [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7011.6s)]
*  and let me get out of here. How dare you speak to me that way? But you can't because she's in charge. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7015.6s)]
*  The whole experience is designed to degrade you and make you less powerful to take your self-respect [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7020.96s)]
*  away. I'm very upset by it. Oh, the DMV, it's almost like they have a line. If you come out [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7028.8s)]
*  of the closet, you get to go to the front of the line. I'd be willing to do that. Yeah, [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7033.68s)]
*  but that's the kind of shit I'm saying. It's like that's how much they want to compromise [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7038.4800000000005s)]
*  who you are or what you are. But look at that. The drop ceiling, there's no reason to have [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7041.92s)]
*  lighting like that. It doesn't cost more maybe to put some lamps or sconces or something. There's [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7046.8s)]
*  nothing more oppressive than a drop ceiling with fluorescent lighting. And there's no reason to have [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7052.240000000001s)]
*  that. And everything is made out of vinyl and metal. There's not one natural material in there. [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7057.76s)]
*  Why not have wooden benches? What would that cost extra? Train stations used to have them, [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7062.16s)]
*  but they don't because the message there is all this shit's disposable. It'll be in a landfill [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7066.16s)]
*  in five years and so will you. Everything about that is degrading to the citizen and it's not [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7070.88s)]
*  an accident. We've been doing that since the day we dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima. [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7076.639999999999s)]
*  That is true. Why? I mean, I have a lot of theories about it. I have no evidence to back up any of my [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7081.28s)]
*  theories. So I should just say that. I think that dropping the atomic bomb on Japan convinced [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7086.32s)]
*  the U.S. government and the Western leaders more broadly that they were God. They had the power to [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7092.4s)]
*  destroy whole cities. Nuclear power when weaponized is the most powerful tool man's ever made. And it [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7097.599999999999s)]
*  gave people the impression that they were God and they lost all humility and all love for their [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7104.799999999999s)]
*  fellow citizens. They lost love for their fellow citizens. That's what our architecture, post-war [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7110.799999999999s)]
*  architecture conveys. I don't love you. I don't care about you. The British colonized whole [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7116.16s)]
*  countries, India, for example, they didn't love the, I mean, they love the Indians, but they thought [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7120.48s)]
*  the Indians were lesser than them. They did. They were racist in our current understanding of that [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7124.5599999999995s)]
*  word, but they built train stations in say, Calcutta or Bombay that would blow your freaking mind. [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7128.96s)]
*  There's nothing as beautiful in the United States as the train stations they built in the subcontinent [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7134.32s)]
*  in India. Oh yeah. Stunning places. Right. Stunning. So like, what does that tell you? And these [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7139.2s)]
*  were colonial train stations built for Indian subjects. Right. Look at that. But they still [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7143.76s)]
*  had a lot of pride in what they built. They did, but they, they people here do the one in Mumbai. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7148.08s)]
*  The Mumbai train station is like the most unbelievable. I met a Pakistani the other day. [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7154.320000000001s)]
*  Well, that was part of India up until 1947. They have their own autonomy now. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7160.16s)]
*  They do. They have nuclear weapons actually. Look at that. Look at that right there. Wow. [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7166.24s)]
*  Look at that. Come on. That looks like, I mean, that's the train station in Bombay, Mumbai, [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7171.92s)]
*  India. Oh yeah. I've been there and it just, I sat there and it's very poorly maintained. The [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7179.2s)]
*  Indian government has done nothing to kind of preserve it, unfortunately. And they've built a [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7184.4s)]
*  lot of garbage architecture they stole from our anti-human architects. But like what kind of [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7188.08s)]
*  country would build something like that? A country that cared about pleasing people. Right. You look [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7194.0s)]
*  at that. That pleases you. You want to keep staring at it because it's beautiful. We've created [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7200.08s)]
*  nothing of beauty in the United States in 80 years. Like what the hell Roy Lichtenstein and [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7204.0s)]
*  Andy Warhol. That's beauty. No, it's not. It's garbage. Yeah. Yeah. It's bootleg. [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7209.28s)]
*  Am I? Yeah. Oh yeah. I like your attitude. Well, you know where there's great architecture that [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7216.5599999999995s)]
*  blew my mind? Milwaukee. The best down by the river. Dude, Milwaukee is a, such a [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7222.88s)]
*  beautiful city. I totally agree with you. I had no idea. Have you tried Cleveland? Uh, yeah. I mean, [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7229.76s)]
*  Cleveland obviously is famously screwed up. Mistake by the lake. But it's like, look at that right [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7235.76s)]
*  there. So the Germans built it. Milwaukee was a German city. Obviously. It was. Oh yeah. That's why [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7241.280000000001s)]
*  the beer was brewed there. Oh yeah. Yeah. Very German city. I love, but we just, I. And they recreated [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7245.4400000000005s)]
*  Europe. The best of Europe. Yeah. Cleveland definitely, it was a bit of a different experience. I [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7250.08s)]
*  think when I was there, um, look at that, look at that building. Imagine building something like that. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7255.04s)]
*  And instead we build glass boxes that are lead certified and it's like we've built nothing [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7262.32s)]
*  of value, nothing of permanence, nothing we have built in my lifetime will last. And rightly so [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7269.68s)]
*  there are Roman buildings and arches. Rome, that are going to last longer. Felt in the fifth century [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7276.08s)]
*  and they're still there. And that will, the outlast of construction of a fucking half these [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7283.28s)]
*  pet codes. It's true. It's totally true. Yeah. Sorry. I didn't know. It's crazy though, but we just, [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7287.28s)]
*  there's something, something happened. And I think, I think that's the infection that starts to get [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7292.719999999999s)]
*  into the spirit of us, you know? And I think that's the fight that's going on inside of a lot of [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7297.2s)]
*  people. Make something beautiful. That's what we should be telling kids. Like your job in life, [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7301.44s)]
*  it's not just working for the man and paying the bills. It's make one thing that's beautiful, [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7305.36s)]
*  that you were proud of. That's an expression of something good inside you. Make it with your hands [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7309.2s)]
*  or with your mouth, but make it make something beautiful. I don't know why that's. And by the [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7314.0s)]
*  way, the, when you say something that you think is that you think, not others, you think is [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7319.599999999999s)]
*  particularly funny or insightful. You're getting the truth about something. Aren't you filled with [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7324.08s)]
*  like this? Wow. Doesn't that feel like better than anything? Yeah. I think it feels like what [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7327.84s)]
*  you're supposed to be doing. Yes. That's it. Exactly. You're doing what you're supposed to [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7333.92s)]
*  be doing. What God made you to do. That's my feeling. And we, but that's not advice that we [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7338.16s)]
*  give it all. It's like how to be an obedient, get some stupid degree at some stupid college [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7343.2s)]
*  to be an obedient employee to some stupid asshole who runs it, who's going to mistreat you. Yeah. [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7347.84s)]
*  How do we, um, what's new in your world? What do you, what, well I've gone crazy. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7354.4s)]
*  Sorry. What are you doing now that's different with, uh, you know, you got on the Twitter, [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7360.24s)]
*  right? And so I know that and congratulations. I think it's interesting. It's brave for people [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7366.32s)]
*  to get out of the system. A lot of people, I was expelled from the system. Oh yeah. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7371.12s)]
*  Well, you got, you got laid off from everywhere. Was it cutbacks or why did you cutbacks? [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7375.44s)]
*  I love, I'm going to use that though. There's downsizing just downsizing. Yeah. I'm being [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7383.04s)]
*  retrained. I'm learning to code actually. They closed the plant. I totally get, I was on third [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7387.759999999999s)]
*  shift and they're just the demand was in decline. Um, I am going to use that though. Next time. [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7394.32s)]
*  Now are you fired? Um, but you got out and you moved to, uh, I was thrown out, uh, thrown out [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7399.679999999999s)]
*  and I, and Elon called me the day that I, my show was canceled and, um, and I was grateful that he [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7405.599999999999s)]
*  did and he called you on, had you spoken to him before? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. He, I had, [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7411.2s)]
*  and, uh, and I really liked him and, um, I'm not a technology person to put it mildly, like at all. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7415.759999999999s)]
*  Very anti-technology. Yep. Like almost on a crazy sort of Ted Kaczynski way, which is, I'm not [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7422.16s)]
*  defending it. So who handles tech for you then kind of? The tech people. I don't, they, they, [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7427.36s)]
*  they live in Bangalore. I don't know their names. Just kidding. No, we have super smart people. [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7431.68s)]
*  The Bangaloreans? The Bangaloreans. No, um, actually our, the Mandalorian, most of our staff from Fox [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7436.24s)]
*  came. Um, and Elon's, I mean, we don't work for Elon. I'm just, I'm a Twitter user like everybody [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7444.0s)]
*  else, but his, all he said was, um, I'm going to keep the platform open, you know, and people [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7449.68s)]
*  with differing views, whether it's a good thing or not, are welcome on the platform. And that's, [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7455.04s)]
*  that's the guarantee that I wanted and needed. And so I've been super grateful. I mean, that's all [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7458.8s)]
*  I've ever wanted by the way, um, is to, I've never been a, I have made some money, but not, [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7463.12s)]
*  I never got crazy rich, but I never wanted to. That wasn't my goal at all. I mean, I guess I would [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7470.240000000001s)]
*  like to be richer, I guess. I don't know what I would do with it exactly. Well, it's now, it [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7475.44s)]
*  almost looks like a sickness too. You know, I think there should be a cap on the, the, the money [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7479.599999999999s)]
*  acquisition thing. Yeah. There was a name for that actually. Historically it was called greed. Yeah. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7483.5199999999995s)]
*  And then somewhere along the line, we like decide you weren't allowed to complain about greed. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7488.5599999999995s)]
*  And I don't really, and because you're against capitalism, first of all, there is no capitalism [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7492.96s)]
*  in the United States. There's no free market. Okay. The government controls everything. You [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7497.12s)]
*  can't have a business without intersecting with government and the government is used by businesses [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7501.92s)]
*  to create monopoly. So there's no free market. So let's stop lying about that. Second, I am not [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7506.16s)]
*  against capitalism. I'm for competition. I wish capitalism would return to the United States. [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7509.92s)]
*  But that doesn't mean that you can't say if I've got a billion dollars and I need 10 more, that [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7515.04s)]
*  that's your sick actually. If that's your goal, what would you do with a billion dollars? I mean, [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7519.04s)]
*  I don't want a billion dollars, not that I'm in danger of getting it, but if I was, I'd be like, [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7524.8s)]
*  I don't want that because then you spend your whole life worrying about losing it. [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7528.16s)]
*  And your existence becomes about preserving money when your existence should be about loving the [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7531.76s)]
*  people around you and creating something beautiful. Those are your jobs as a person, in my opinion. [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7535.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Well, could we put a cap on how much money people are allowed to make? [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7540.88s)]
*  I guess people would find their way around it. I mean, the way to do it is to say it out loud. [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7545.76s)]
*  Again, everything changes with words. Articulate the truth. It's not an attack on capitalism, [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7550.08s)]
*  which again does not exist in the United States, and I wish it did, to say it is ugly. In fact, [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7556.24s)]
*  it's a sin to worship money. It is. You should not be worshiping money. Worship God, worship [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7562.24s)]
*  people around you, worship nature even. But worshiping money is disgusting and we should not [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7568.0s)]
*  compliment people who do it. We should instead criticize them and say, that's gross. Hey, hedge [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7574.88s)]
*  fund manager, that's gross. I'm sorry, I think that. No, I fucking think that too, man. I remember [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7579.76s)]
*  two years ago, it was the first time I'd really made some money in my life. And I thought, and I [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7587.12s)]
*  remember, I was in my garage and I just was fucking heartbroken, man. I remember calling my brother, [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7592.639999999999s)]
*  I was crying. But it didn't make you happy? I thought, yeah, because I didn't even know [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7599.92s)]
*  it was money. I didn't know if it was popularity. I don't know what had happened, but I got into a [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7604.8s)]
*  different space in my career. I finally knew I could pay my mortgage for the year. And I thought [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7608.24s)]
*  that that, somehow in the back of my head, without me even realizing it, I thought that that would [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7614.16s)]
*  be the answer to everything. And when it wasn't, it fucking killed me. But nobody wants to hear [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7618.8s)]
*  that also from somebody who- But it's the most familiar thing I've ever heard. It's like, [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7625.92s)]
*  I could tell you so many stories. It just made me so sad that I'd just been fooled, [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7630.32s)]
*  and even fooled by myself. Well, getting what you want is one of the saddest things that can [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7634.16s)]
*  happen to you. I mean, when you're happiest when, as a man, I'll speak for men because I am one, [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7638.4s)]
*  you have a clear mission. For now. For now. I mean, I could totally change. Oh, they'll change. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7643.76s)]
*  If I get a better spot at the DMV. Tucker? It does change. There's something going on [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7648.8s)]
*  in the water, baby. And that's why I, if I could take a break to just promote my non-sponsors in. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7655.6s)]
*  And these are threes, and I normally use sixes, but I appreciate the gesture. But [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7662.96s)]
*  I do think nicotine does keep your testosterone levels up. Really? I'd do one of those suppositories. [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7667.280000000001s)]
*  I'm not doing a big one or anything, you know? I mean, maybe during the holidays. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7673.36s)]
*  It's not like an expander. It's just a regular spud. Okay. I would do something small, you know? [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7676.719999999999s)]
*  Just pop a bead in or something, you know, if I'm going to be at the ball part. [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7681.2s)]
*  I do probably just something, half a gram or whatever, milligrams. I don't know what it comes [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7686.08s)]
*  in. Three milligrams. But getting what you want, succeeding, that's when men fall apart. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7690.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. But then also I think that there were more opportunities for success in the past, [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7698.8s)]
*  and there was more opportunities to feel value in the past. Like I remember when I was a kid, [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7703.52s)]
*  we used to get our name in the paper and it made you feel so good, like your local baseball score. [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7707.360000000001s)]
*  Right. And like, even if you lost, they fucking put your last name. Yeah, I get it. Oh, for four, [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7711.12s)]
*  right? Cried, even though put cried, like in parentheses, you're like, fuck yeah, dude. Like, [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7716.320000000001s)]
*  at least I'm on the stat sheet. They caught you crying? Yeah. I mean, I had an appendectomy, [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7721.2s)]
*  right? And the guy who I think was closeted or whatever was our co was like assistant coach or [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7726.72s)]
*  whatever. And he was screaming at me to get to third base. And literally my appendix had burst. [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7731.6s)]
*  So can you show me on the doll where this happened? [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7735.84s)]
*  Dude, I remember we had a dude bus. There's something here. I can feel it. Oh, bro. This [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7740.96s)]
*  guy's screaming at me to get to third base. My appendix burst. I'm laying in the fucking dirt. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7745.4400000000005s)]
*  Right. And that's a sign of our fucking country nowadays. They're like, get to fucking third base. [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7750.88s)]
*  You're like, I have sepsis and nobody fucking cares, man. But they still put you in the stat [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7756.0s)]
*  sheet, you know, oh, for four. Um, yeah, I think, oh, we had a dude who was touching players and [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7763.36s)]
*  they just called him and they're like, look, you can't keep coaching if you're going to touch [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7770.48s)]
*  players. That was touching him like in an affirming way. Uh, I think just extra affirming, like two, [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7775.36s)]
*  affirming, like overhand, you're affirming, but once you turn the hand this way, [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7782.16s)]
*  reach around, not affirm it. Yeah. Yeah. If you're doing that, yeah. From the, that's totally, [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7788.8s)]
*  totally, that's on affirming, dude. Um, what do you think about, where do we go? [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7793.04s)]
*  Does Bobby Kennedy jr. Have any chance? Does a third party have any chance? No, no, [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7798.96s)]
*  a third party can affect the outcome for sure. But the system is, I mean, this could change with [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7804.0s)]
*  time, but the system it's, it's so it's shown no sign of changing. I could bore you for hours, [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7808.64s)]
*  but you know, Ross Perot ran in 92 and then 96, you know, and he got Clinton elected. [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7813.52s)]
*  And you're the ears. That was the campaign. Yeah. I never heard that. I just made it up. [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7817.76s)]
*  That was good. Thanks. But he, and he actually was, it was kind of impressive. He was a real [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7822.56s)]
*  smart guy. He was, he was, and he said a lot of things to try not to be true, but of course he [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7828.88s)]
*  was attacked as some kind of crazy person, but, um, including by me, I should say, [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7832.160000000001s)]
*  damn really? Yeah. I was used as a tool. Do you even notice you're a tool when you're a [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7837.12s)]
*  tool like that for the, for the, no, I was 20, I was in my early twenties and I was writing, [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7842.48s)]
*  I was covering, first of all, people that are only 20 should not be covering anything other than like [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7848.4s)]
*  kids with appendectomies in baseball. Like that, that right. Shouldn't be covering national politics [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7852.799999999999s)]
*  in your 20. Like, what do you know? You don't know shit. So you shouldn't be rendering judgment. [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7858.0s)]
*  A hundred percent, a hundred percent, you know, FFA events or whatever, but not, not politics. [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7863.4400000000005s)]
*  But anyway, I was, and I attacked him as a crazy person. And I was used by the person I was working [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7870.240000000001s)]
*  for who's still a public person and truly a dishonest person. But anyway, whatever. [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7874.64s)]
*  If it's Chuck Schumer to say it. More dishonest than Chuck Schumer. [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7880.72s)]
*  Yeah. Anyway, I can't even get into it. But the point is he got 23% or whatever. I think [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7885.599999999999s)]
*  it was 23 that year in 90. Oh yeah. Wow. Dude. Cause he was running basically on pre sort of a [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7893.599999999999s)]
*  pre Trump, more restrained, more academic, you know, less, you know, less Trump, but, [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7901.5199999999995s)]
*  but the idea was the same. Like manufacturing is dying and it's going to wreck the country. [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7907.12s)]
*  We need to make things. Stuff like that. Bush, Perot and Dukakis. No, who was that? [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7911.36s)]
*  Dukakis was 88. It was Bush, Perot and Bill Clinton. Wow. Who was then the governor of [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7915.44s)]
*  Arkansas in 1992 was the first race I covered. And Perot did really well despite massive hostility [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7920.72s)]
*  from the media, because of course they were protecting. Yeah. You know, their bosses, [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7927.12s)]
*  establishment. Exactly. That's exactly it. But I didn't perceive any of this. 18.9% he got. [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7931.84s)]
*  What did he get? 18.9%. I'm sorry. 19%. I'm embarrassed. Did he affect the outcome of that [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7936.08s)]
*  race? Well, he, he won it for Clinton. I mean, Clinton won it as you see on the page at 43%, [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7941.6s)]
*  43%. Absolutely. If Perot didn't win, do you think that Bush wins that? Of course. Yeah. [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7946.08s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. He took from Bush. Yeah. Who is Kennedy taken from? [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7950.96s)]
*  What do you think? Trump. You think? Of course. There's no person who's thinking, [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7954.72s)]
*  Hmm, I'm going to vote either for Joe Biden or Bobby Kennedy. I have some friends that are. No [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7961.6s)]
*  way. I swear. Really? I have some friends that are, that have known Bobby. I mean, these are [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7967.76s)]
*  people that have known Bobby Kennedy for a long time. And, but who are Democrats who are like, [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7973.280000000001s)]
*  this is my guy. The only reason you would vote for Joe Biden is because you believe there's safety in [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7979.52s)]
*  numbers. You're voting for the party. You're not obviously, I'm not attacking Biden, but you're not [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7985.360000000001s)]
*  voting for Biden. You're voting for the democratic party because you think when they have more power, [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7988.08s)]
*  you're safer or richer or whatever. Right. That's the only reason. And Bobby Kennedy, man, I mean, [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7991.68s)]
*  I've never seen anybody get right to the core issues. The effect in the country, the way he [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=7996.96s)]
*  has, and I don't agree with them and everything, but I mean, he names names. I mean, in a big way. [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8003.36s)]
*  Yeah. That's why I love him. I think, well, I just think he can fuck. He doesn't know. I don't feel [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8008.24s)]
*  like he's in anybody's pocket. Do you feel like low key there's some party that's like planted [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8012.8s)]
*  him in there? People say that, but that's, that's crazy. I think I, I mean, I feel like I know Bobby [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8018.56s)]
*  very well and I, I am totally convinced just on a human level that he is an honest person. [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8024.24s)]
*  And I don't think that he would do that. And I just have to ask, are there people in his orbit [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8030.8s)]
*  who would do that? I believe yes is the answer, but I don't think he knows better. It has anything [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8035.28s)]
*  to do with it. I think he's totally sincere. He's certainly not in anyone's pocket. I mean, the guy [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8040.32s)]
*  could be his name is Bobby Kennedy. He's the son of, oh, we could do whatever he could do, whatever [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8043.84s)]
*  he could do, whatever. And he has done, he's done a ton of great stuff with his life. He has, but I'm [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8049.12s)]
*  just saying it's very easy to be loved by everybody and to just, it's very easy to make money when [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8053.52s)]
*  everyone loves you. Bobby Kennedy could have an infinitely easier life than the one he's chosen. [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8058.240000000001s)]
*  He's doing this because he sincerely believes it. Look at that. Right. And he's under threat. I mean, [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8063.52s)]
*  I was with him on the street the other day, this week in Washington and the security people around [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8068.240000000001s)]
*  him were very nervous. He was not nervous at all, but they were. Anyway, the point is I think Bobby's [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8073.76s)]
*  totally sincere, but he is giving a massive middle finger to the establishment, like almost [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8079.44s)]
*  as aggressively as I've ever seen anybody. Why can't we get him to a level? Cause what percent [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8085.28s)]
*  does he have to get? Oh, I guess I don't, we don't know because you don't know what has to win. [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8090.4s)]
*  We need to get the plurality. You know, we need to get more than the other two. And unfortunately, [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8094.32s)]
*  the system is set up where it's hard for a third party guy to get on all ballots. I mean, they've [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8098.639999999999s)]
*  rigged the system against a third party challenge because they don't want that. Who has rigged the [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8102.879999999999s)]
*  system? Both of the parties? Both of the parties. Yeah, of course. Of course they don't. I mean, [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8106.4s)]
*  once you have power, what's your number one goal? It's preserving it and preventing people from [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8110.32s)]
*  challenging you. You know, of course. When there's a revolution, what city should we meet up in? [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8115.44s)]
*  Well, if there is a revolution and I pray there isn't cause they never end well, but if there is, [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8122.24s)]
*  But it'd be fucking fun, huh? For like the first 20 minutes when you actually storm the Bastille [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8126.96s)]
*  and free the prisoners or whatever, hang your homemade flag from the roof of the Capitol or [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8131.28s)]
*  whatever. Like you burn the news networks is the first thing you'd have to do. So that'd be the fun [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8136.32s)]
*  part of the revolution. I think that'd be, that would be definitely be the fun part. But then it [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8140.96s)]
*  gets, then you have like show trials and famines and you have like all the downsides, but whatever, [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8145.04s)]
*  I'm not in charge. So if that happens, I will be so deep in the woods surrounded by my dogs [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8150.48s)]
*  and I'll say it firearms. Probably not going to hear it from you. [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8157.52s)]
*  Let's just pretend one of your dogs is named firearms. [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8161.360000000001s)]
*  I actually have a dog called firearm. I have AK and 47. [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8164.64s)]
*  I got a bow. I got arrow. I got whatever, you know, I got all my weapons in the woods with me. [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8170.0s)]
*  But yeah, and you can even just text me and just let me know where you're going to be. But [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8177.4400000000005s)]
*  I think about the, you know, it's wild. I think about that sometimes, [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8181.76s)]
*  But you're going to be in LA. [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8184.4800000000005s)]
*  No, I won't be. I live in Nashville. Oh, you don't live in LA. [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8186.080000000001s)]
*  No, I live in a place where if somebody is being weird, you can do that. [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8189.52s)]
*  Because if you're in LA, you just get eaten. Yeah. Oh, well, here's the move. You would do in LA. [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8196.24s)]
*  You would get in a boat and go off the shore. That would be the first move and let the other [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8200.48s)]
*  Having grown up on the Pacific. Let me just say it's a little bigger than the chunk of funky river, [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8205.12s)]
*  wherever you're from. Super big ocean. Yeah. And also fuck Ben and Jerry's while we're at us. [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8209.92s)]
*  Yeah. But go on. They're Marxist. Is it called chunky monkey? What's the name of your river? [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8216.24s)]
*  Chuff on the chip. But I love that. That's the greatest name ever. But the Pacific goes on [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8220.88s)]
*  forever. And then you make it to Hawaii like six days later in your Boston. Yeah. Right. Well, [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8228.24s)]
*  if you've been lost to see for six days, you deserve to show up in Hawaii. It's easy to [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8234.48s)]
*  miss Hawaii though in the middle of the Pacific. You could. Yeah. That's a long way to Thailand. [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8237.76s)]
*  Did you imagine they'd pick you up? Like you fuck you. It is close to Hawaii. Like what the fuck? [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8241.76s)]
*  I let my wife drive. No, the Pacific is not a good escape plan at all. No, because south you have, [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8247.12s)]
*  you know, Baja Sonata. Right. Right. That's gonna be a little chaotic. It always is. Yeah. From [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8254.880000000001s)]
*  Los Angeles to what? The Arctic Circle. I mean, that's just like nothing. It's like Alaska. Like [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8261.36s)]
*  you're kind of nowhere to go. Yeah. But you get in the woods. Deep in there. Yeah. You got a shot. [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8267.52s)]
*  You've got a shot in the Radley up in there with a couple of pups. 100%. You go full boot Radley. [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8274.720000000001s)]

*  but I think people start to think that way. How? And that's a sad, it's interesting because it [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8286.0s)]
*  thought it just comes in my head. Sometimes I've thought about asking people I know. I've thought [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8290.16s)]
*  about asking Joe Rogan, where do we meet up? If shit gets weird. And I'd never used to think that [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8294.16s)]
*  Joe's going to leave his house, right? He might not, but I think everybody's got a little bit [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8300.16s)]
*  of a place. You know, I think some people are thinking maybe could be, I think you want to do [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8304.4s)]
*  mountainous. So I think you go Salt Lake or Denver, you know, Broncos suck. But so I don't know if I'd [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8309.28s)]
*  go there. Utah at least doesn't have a team. Um, I don't know, but you start to think about that. You [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8315.36s)]
*  want to get up to sea level, you know, you don't want nature beating you. So you don't want to [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8321.44s)]
*  drown out. You don't want to be in fucking Johnstown or something or Jones or whatever that place is. [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8325.6s)]
*  Johnstown or Jones town or Jones town, both of them bad, bad, bad, purple Kool-Aid overflowing [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8329.92s)]
*  rivers. Um, you don't want to go anywhere. I think is the truth. You don't want to go anywhere. You [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8337.92s)]
*  don't want to, you don't want to travel. If things go, go sideways, I don't, you don't think you want [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8342.800000000001s)]
*  to be on the road. I mean, that's a good point. The two times I've been in places for brief periods [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8347.92s)]
*  where, you know, there really was no authority. Um, what did that feel like? And where was it? [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8353.2s)]
*  One was Katrina right after the storm in New Orleans. Wow. You were down there on bro. I was. [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8358.08s)]
*  And the other was in Baghdad in December of oh three when it kind of like started to get, [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8364.08s)]
*  I felt out of hand and which one was more hectic you think of Baghdad, but I, but for the United [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8368.960000000001s)]
*  States, I really, no one ever says this. I really feel like Katrina was like, was almost unbelievable [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8375.28s)]
*  how chaotic it was. Oh yeah. Oh, for real. I mean, I, yeah, I could bore you, but. Oh, I've been in a [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8379.76s)]
*  game when the saints are fucking losing to the Falcons and it gets fucking hectic enough. There is [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8385.44s)]
*  no one there to call like a period. And then people start behaving in ways that are ridiculous. And [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8389.52s)]
*  I saw, I saw that with my own eyes and dead people and people getting shot. Like I saw it, not guessing. [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8396.560000000001s)]
*  And I was just like, this cannot be America. Like I always thought if something bad happened, [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8403.44s)]
*  there would be like, you just like call some special number and like dad comes and restores [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8407.6s)]

*  to take down a society that's digital. Oh yeah. Once you unplug that and then when there's, [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8442.16s)]
*  but that's a crazy feeling when you're like, okay, cause your first thought is let me call somebody. [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8447.279999999999s)]

*  my brain, I think is recording this because it feels like it could be plausible. All you need is [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8533.44s)]
*  a couple of cops to be like, you know what? Fuck these people as well. I'm not going to fucking quit [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8538.96s)]
*  I'm not going to quit blockading or attacking these people who I know are really struggling [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8544.64s)]
*  when I'm going home tonight and being one of them. A hundred percent. And by the way, my kids, [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8549.359999999999s)]
*  my kids were at home and there's now this happened in New Orleans during Katrina is cops and I give [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8553.599999999999s)]
*  them all the benefit of the doubt. You know, some of them you do have some criminal cops down there, [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8558.0s)]
*  but you also have good guys too, you know, and the good guys are like, I'm sorry. I got a wife [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8561.679999999998s)]
*  and kids at home. Like I'm not, and people are going nuts. The thing that I noticed was it took [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8565.68s)]
*  like zero time from when authority disappeared for people to get super afraid for the predators [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8570.16s)]
*  to come out and start praying on people and for everything just to fall apart, everything. Yeah. [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8577.28s)]
*  And if you unplug this country, and by the way, once you decide you're going to go to war with Iran [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8582.720000000001s)]
*  as we've apparently the morons who run our country have decided that is, I mean, a very likely outcome [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8587.36s)]
*  that they're going to do something like that. Really? Absolutely. Absolutely. Everyone's like, [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8593.84s)]
*  oh, they, they could send an ICBM or whatever. Why would they bother to throw a missile at the [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8598.4s)]
*  United States across the ocean when they could unplug the country? And then you have real [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8604.64s)]
*  casualties, mass casualties and mass chaos, like true, true chaos. Oh yeah. People are not prepared [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8613.12s)]
*  for this. They haven't thought it through or leaders have not prepared them for it at all. [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8618.64s)]
*  It's like, oh, it's on your iPhone. You don't have an iPhone and there's no electricity and [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8622.24s)]
*  there's no water and there's no way to get anywhere. Yeah. Come on, dude. And that could happen. [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8626.32s)]
*  That's not science fiction. That could happen soon. And we're not ready for it. And as you said, [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8633.2s)]
*  it's not a cohesive country. People are not like, oh, I'm going to help my neighbors. You don't know [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8638.4s)]
*  who your neighbors are. They may not speak the same language. Well, you're certainly not going to [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8641.84s)]
*  also help your government. So that's going to be the weird thing. When the government's like, [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8646.16s)]
*  people do this, it's you're it. You might if you're a lot of people like, fuck you. I don't trust [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8650.64s)]
*  you. Totally. And people have not seen chaos. They don't know what chaos looks like. We don't. [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8657.359999999999s)]
*  Like when people imagine war, they imagine two lines against each other, lobbying artillery shells [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8661.199999999999s)]
*  or rifle fire at each other. There's a certain order to that. And people can can handle it. [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8667.039999999999s)]
*  It's dangerous, but I can handle it. It makes sense to me. It's orderly. It's geometric. Chaos [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8672.4s)]
*  is completely different from that. Chaos is like you have no freaking idea what's happening, [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8677.28s)]
*  who's on your side, who's not, who's a threat, who isn't, where things are going. [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8683.04s)]
*  People are not designed for that. People can't handle chaos and they go crazy. And I've only, [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8687.2s)]
*  as I said, had a taste of this a couple of times, but enough to learn chaos is the one thing you [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8693.04s)]
*  have to avoid, because that's when people become animals and really start behaving in ways that are [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8697.68s)]
*  inconceivable to civilized people. Oh, we're going to turn into middle monkeys real fast. [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8701.92s)]
*  Like in minutes. Yeah. Oh, yeah, bro. Dude, I was at a Dave and Buster's one time. [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8706.56s)]
*  I'm not even joking. Fucking power goes out, dude. Did you eat anyone? Bro, it was whacka everyone [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8712.72s)]
*  in that bitch, dude. People were beating the shit. It was complete darkness. Right. And people, [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8718.96s)]
*  yeah, you're fucking feeling around for whatever, you know, birthday cake or whatever. You're, [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8724.32s)]
*  you know, like you don't even know what's going on. Yeah. But that was created at the Dave and [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8728.0s)]
*  Buster's. I know. You know? Um, so what is your plans now? Like you've already, you're on Twitter, [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8732.08s)]
*  you're in a free space as much as we have in today's society. You're in a free space for free [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8739.039999999999s)]
*  speech. What else do you, is there like, we have some plans. I mean, some of them, I mean, if I'm [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8743.84s)]
*  being honest, include territorial expansion. We're going to invade Canada. Oh dude, they'll just knock. [[02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8750.32s)]
*  No pillow fight. You take them in a second. Um, no, I mean, I just want to continue doing [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8757.279999999999s)]
*  what we're doing, which is just, you know, say, say things that can't be said in other places, [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8765.039999999999s)]
*  bring facts that maybe people haven't heard with the spirit of humility. You know, if you, I'm [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8771.6s)]
*  having spent my whole life in Washington, most of it, 35 years, I'm very, I know it's, I can't believe [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8777.76s)]
*  it. But you know what? I think a lot of people were glad that somebody was there. You know, [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8783.6s)]
*  it's nice to see people that get out of a space because then they're, when you're not as compromised, [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8786.880000000001s)]
*  when people don't see them as compromised. It's totally right. No, it's totally true, [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8791.76s)]
*  but I didn't realize just how controlled my brain was by it when I was in it, because you don't, [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8794.4s)]
*  right? But, um, but anyway, but I've been around a lot of people who set out like with these [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8798.880000000001s)]
*  grandiose plans. I'm going to change the world. Those people invariably, 100% of the time make [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8804.08s)]
*  the world worse. So like, you know, approach every task with the knowledge. I have no real [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8809.52s)]
*  idea what I'm doing. I don't know the long-term consequences of this. I probably can't fix every [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8816.0s)]
*  problem. I'm just going to try my best with humility, you know, to make things slightly [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8821.52s)]
*  better. That's my goal. Make things slightly better. But anyone who tells you, wait, if we [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8827.52s)]
*  pass this legislation, we're going to fix everything. We're going to fix healthcare [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8832.560000000001s)]
*  forever, said Barack Obama in 2010. As soon as he said that, I was like, I don't even know much [[02:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8836.32s)]
*  about healthcare. I'm hardly an expert, but I was like, the second you tell me you're going to fix [[02:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8841.279999999999s)]
*  something as complicated as, you know, one fifth of the entire US economy in one piece of legislation, [[02:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8844.96s)]
*  fuck you. Because you're lying actually, because that's impossible. And it turned out they made [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8849.84s)]
*  it worse. Of course. So I don't want to do that. Not that I even have the power to, but I just want [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8855.039999999999s)]
*  to, you know, I just want to tell the truth and do it without being told not to. And I think that we [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8861.519999999999s)]
*  can. And Tucker on X is your show. Yep. Right. And do you guys have, do you think, would you ever do [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8869.439999999999s)]
*  a show with a partner, you think, or anything like that? I'm not going to pitch you an idea. I'm just, [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8875.759999999998s)]
*  because that's usually the predecessor question, like somebody trying to pitch you an idea. But [[02:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8882.0s)]
*  do you think about that sort of thing? Like, do you have- Well, I mean, I have a million people I [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8885.839999999998s)]
*  would like to work with. I mean, you know, I like to interview people actually and a lot. And I [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8889.68s)]
*  really try to be quiet while I interview them because I'm a compulsive talker, obviously. [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8897.28s)]
*  But I'd like a respite from that where I can just like listen. So I like to, [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8901.92s)]
*  we will have a lot of people on and we have, and we'll have a lot of recurring guests. But yeah, [[02:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8905.76s)]
*  we have all, we're making a bunch of documentaries and doing stuff like that. So like a production [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8910.64s)]
*  company kind of more, like are you expanding in that sense? Yep. Like what is that one? Ben Shapiro [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8915.52s)]
*  has one. Outkick is a company. Is that a company? Daily Wire. I don't know what Outkick is. I have [[02:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8921.84s)]
*  a friend who works there. Outkick, I think it was football and then they- Okay. Does Jason still work [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8928.0s)]
*  there? Do you know Jason Whitlock? Yeah, I do know Jason Whitlock. I met him one time. So I love Jason [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8937.44s)]
*  Whitlock. Is he a really neat guy? He seemed very friendly. I didn't get to talk to him much. He's a [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8944.32s)]
*  great guy and very deep. He's not a shallow person at all. Really? He's the kind of person when you're [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8948.16s)]
*  talking to him, Whitlock's, oh there he is right there, Whitlock will say things and you're like, [[02:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8952.64s)]
*  wait, what? I'm sorry, I just want to have like a super shallow conversation. Like how are you? I'm [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8957.76s)]
*  great. How are you? And he'll, because I'm shallow in some ways and he'll like, he doesn't, he doesn't [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8961.52s)]
*  think like that or talk like that. He'll sort of like super heavy stuff out there. And it's cool. [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8967.44s)]
*  That'd be interesting. Sometimes I want to have deeper conversations with people, but I think I [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8971.12s)]
*  might get afraid to get into them or I don't know how to get into them without seeming like I'm being [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8974.560000000001s)]
*  obtrusive or I don't know. With him, you don't have to worry because he does it. He's okay with it. [[02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8980.800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Well, he just goes there, immediately goes there. I like that about him. Do you ever get [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8985.84s)]
*  asked, and then we'll wrap up because I know you've been here for a while and thanks for your time. [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8993.52s)]
*  I love it. Do you ever get asked to bring people over to Twitter? Like, is there like [[02:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=8996.96s)]
*  no movement? Cause I know John Stewart just had a show with Apple, right? Was that recently? [[02:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9002.56s)]
*  Where he canceled. Yeah. He had a show with Apple. John Stewart, John Stewart, the guy from the daily [[02:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9010.08s)]
*  show from the daily show. John Stewart show on Apple is ending Mr. Stewart end. And sorry, [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9015.839999999998s)]
*  Apple are parting ways because of creative differences over. I didn't even know he had a [[02:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9022.48s)]
*  show on Apple. So it shows you what I know people with the knowledge. But they had a disagreement [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9026.0s)]
*  about the episodes, the type of episodes he wanted to do. He wanted to do episodes on, [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9030.88s)]
*  can we move it down? Okay. According to the reporter head of its decision to end [[02:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9036.08s)]
*  Apple approached Stewart directly and express its need for the host and his team to be aligned with [[02:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9040.4s)]
*  the company's views on topics discussed rather than falling in line. When Apple threatened to [[02:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9044.16s)]
*  cancel the show, Stewart reportedly decided to walk Stewart. That would be discussions of [[02:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9049.84s)]
*  artificial intelligence and China were a major concern for Apple. Why would they be concerned [[02:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9055.6s)]
*  with him having episodes like that? I mean, we're assuming that's true. I hope it's true. That's a [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9060.880000000001s)]
*  noble reason to leave. You know, if you think there's something really important you want to [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9064.800000000001s)]
*  cover and your boss says, no, it's a good reason to quit. So I hope that that's right. Was there [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9068.720000000001s)]
*  another time you almost quit before? My sense is that show, I mean, I didn't know even though that [[02:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9073.2s)]
*  show existed, so I don't think it was doing well. I don't think so. Yeah. And Stewart, obviously a [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9078.4s)]
*  talented guy. I knew him, you know, yeah, he's kind of beloved 25 years ago. Yeah. He, I always [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9083.52s)]
*  thought he was talented. He definitely did what I think everyone does at some point. And it's [[02:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9090.08s)]
*  important to come out of it and start to mistake yourself for like a messianic figure and just be [[02:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9094.720000000001s)]
*  like, no, I'm just a guy. Like it's so important. And I've done that. So I've been there. Oh yeah. [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9099.6s)]
*  Your ego is the first thing to grow. 100%. And it's very scary. You're like, dang, does God have [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9104.880000000001s)]

*  destroy yourself. You will lose the respect of your wife and your friends. If you don't pull back [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9114.560000000001s)]
*  from that. Yeah. And just remember I am an asshole. And if you don't believe that next time you get [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9119.44s)]
*  out of the shower, walk in front of the mirror and look at, look at yourself and be like, am I [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9126.08s)]

*  Yeah. Right. Yeah. So yeah. Right. Exactly. So like it's important to do that. You know what I mean? [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9137.92s)]
*  That will keep you from thinking you're the Messiah. I don't think he has any mirrors in his house. [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9145.04s)]
*  Any other question that or anything you wanted to talk about Tucker? No. [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9150.560000000001s)]
*  Okay. I know you share everything on your own show. I just share everything in general. [[02:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9154.16s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. I've enjoyed the hell out of it. Yeah, man. It's been a lot of fun. I've had a great time. [[02:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9157.84s)]
*  Yeah. Me too. I appreciate it. You're the only person I've talked to in the last, well, probably ever. [[02:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9162.0s)]
*  Who one of my kids will be impressed by. They're not impressed at all. Yeah. They're impressed by [[02:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9167.36s)]
*  you. I don't know why you've obviously got some sort of sort of weird magic power over younger [[02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9172.640000000001s)]
*  people. I don't, and I don't know anything about that. You don't abuse it. No, that's the thing. [[02:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9178.480000000001s)]
*  Good. I just, they're not going to start a children's crusade or anything. It came after [[02:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9182.560000000001s)]
*  our industry a couple of years ago. Oh, I didn't mean anything creepy. Okay. Good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[02:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9186.0s)]
*  And I only know adult women and, um, Oh, the, the old women like you. No, I just only know [[02:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9191.44s)]
*  people that are legally adults. Well, of course. Okay. That's all I'm saying, dude, because yeah, [[02:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9197.04s)]
*  immediately like, you know, I remember the New York Times like hunted down half of our industry, [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9203.36s)]
*  you know, like finding like, yeah, just that vague stuff where it comes up. And I think there are a [[02:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9208.080000000002s)]
*  lot of creepy comedians, but not as many as there are in journalism. Yeah. There's some creatures in [[02:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9212.400000000001s)]
*  journalism. Dude, what happened? Remember the guy who jerked off in the zoom meeting and then they [[02:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9216.800000000001s)]
*  brought him back on for the interview. And he sat there and he's like, Oh, you got caught, whack it [[02:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9220.640000000001s)]
*  off and a zoom and everything. I mean, it just shows you his name is Jeff Tubman and you know, [[02:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9225.92s)]
*  not a stupid guy. Actually. I know him and I have worked with him, but he's, Oh yeah. But his desire [[02:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9230.960000000001s)]
*  to be on television trumps everything else. Like if I said to you, you know, if that happened to [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9237.04s)]
*  you, you'd be like, you know what? I'm just kind of out. I'm going to do something. You know what [[02:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9242.16s)]
*  I mean? I'll find something else. People know I'm had issues with it. Right. Yeah. Well, you, but you [[02:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9245.28s)]
*  said you have them under control. You're not compulsive. No, I'm doing great. Just habitual, [[02:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9249.68s)]
*  but not a problem. Yeah. Full moon. But imagine if you're Jeff Tubman to sit there with this female [[02:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9253.04s)]
*  anchor on Fox and talk about that. It's like, there's no shame that you won't bear. There's no [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9261.28s)]
*  shit you won't eat just to be on television. And I, I obviously had no respect for Jeff Tubman [[02:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9268.240000000002s)]
*  anyway, cause I know him. But I had even less after that. I mean, that was weird how God will [[02:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9273.76s)]
*  give you your gifts. You don't fucking know what they're going to be wrapped in. It's like, [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9281.28s)]
*  all he wanted to be was on camera. I know. And just like, you got to want the right things. [[02:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9285.76s)]
*  You know what I mean? I think you got to get real specific with God bro. Cause he's busy. [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9291.76s)]
*  I totally agree. And last thing I'll say is I think it's so important if you are publicly [[02:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9295.6s)]
*  humiliated and I have certainly been, um, and he was of course too, it can be a great thing. [[02:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9301.36s)]
*  That's a great thing. And you should treat it that way and be grateful for it. You know, [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9308.08s)]
*  that this is keeping me from becoming an even worse person than I might otherwise have been. [[02:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9313.92s)]
*  There's nothing worse than a man who spent his entire adult life succeeding and never being [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9318.72s)]
*  humiliated. They become unbearable. They talk only about themselves. They can't bear to listen to [[02:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9322.56s)]
*  you. Every time you talk and you're holding their breath until you stop so they can start up again, [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9328.56s)]
*  they become true narcissists. And I just hope for Jeff Tubin who's really an asshole. Actually, [[02:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9333.44s)]
*  I'm just saying, I don't know. I do. I just like to say he's like, he's an asshole. Yeah, [[02:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9339.44s)]
*  he is, but he may be less of one now. Yeah, actually. And I've certainly been an asshole a [[02:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9344.32s)]
*  lot. So I, oh yeah. I'm not judging, you know, but I do it. So I have high hopes for him. Yeah. [[02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9349.84s)]
*  Caught whacking off. There's a massive upside potentially. Oh yeah, dude. I mean, definitely [[02:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9356.24s)]
*  there's no, yeah, that guy definitely likes jerking, but yeah, anyway, [[02:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9361.6s)]
*  Tucker Carlson, thanks so much, dude. It was interesting and I really appreciate your time. [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9368.4s)]
*  I really do. I did. And thank you for the Zen. All right. Yeah. You bet brother. I might do one later. [[02:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9372.32s)]
*  We'll see. [[02:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2gg2guge4&t=9375.84s)]
