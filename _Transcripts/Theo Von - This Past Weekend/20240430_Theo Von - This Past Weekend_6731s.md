*  shows on the glass. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=115.53999999999999s)]
*  So the area for the public to come in and hang out while we're doing the shows. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=117.38s)]

*  Devotional on Wednesday up there. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=139.98s)]
*  But we'll do weekend long events. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=142.86s)]
*  We've got a money and marriage event with Rachel Cruz, my daughter and Dr. John Delaney, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=144.58s)]
*  two of our Ramsey personalities in the fall. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=148.42000000000002s)]

*  So it's public coming in for public events to learn something that we're doing usually [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=155.5s)]
*  around the money subject or the leadership subject. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=160.14s)]
*  We use it for our entree leadership stuff. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=162.18s)]
*  So it stays pretty busy. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=164.16s)]
*  Wow, yeah it's remarkable. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=165.54s)]
*  Dave Ramsey man, yeah thanks so much man. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=168.73999999999998s)]
*  So just for a lot of our viewers will know you, but some who wouldn't. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=171.42s)]
*  So you started out in finance, like how did you get in? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=175.1s)]
*  What made you care about money out of the gate? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=177.73999999999998s)]
*  Did you guys have allowance issues in the home? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=179.7s)]
*  Yeah, we did. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=183.22s)]
*  You did? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=184.89999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, we were not on allowance. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=185.89999999999998s)]
*  We were on commission. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=186.89999999999998s)]
*  Work, get paid. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=187.89999999999998s)]
*  Don't work, don't get paid. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=188.89999999999998s)]
*  So yeah, I grew up in a blue collar neighborhood. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=189.89999999999998s)]
*  So daddy believed in work. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=192.84s)]
*  Like real work. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=196.29999999999998s)]
*  I was 12 years old and I came in and said I need some money to go to the quick sack [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=197.34s)]
*  and get an IC and he said, no, you need a job. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=200.5s)]
*  I said, what could you do? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=203.5s)]
*  And I said, well, I guess I could cut grass. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=205.06s)]
*  And he took me down here on Nolensville Road and printed up 500 business cards that said [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=206.74s)]
*  Dave's Lawns. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=211.22s)]
*  Go knock on the closest 50 doors and ask the opportunity to provide their lawn care needs. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=213.18s)]
*  So at 12, I ended up with 27 yards to cut. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=218.74s)]
*  So I think they call that child abuse now. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=221.94s)]
*  Yeah, look, yeah. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=223.66000000000003s)]
*  Well, yeah, I think if you force a kid to get a job nowadays, I think protective services [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=225.02s)]
*  will come and get you. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=229.10000000000002s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=230.10000000000002s)]
*  You know, it's pretty, sometimes it can be like that. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=231.10000000000002s)]
*  It can be kind of alarming. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=232.58s)]
*  There wasn't a protective service that would have protected them from my parents. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=233.58s)]
*  But yeah, so anyway, we grew up doing that. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=236.9s)]
*  And then I started buying and selling real estate in my 20s and got rich starting from [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=240.46s)]
*  nothing and I had, at least where I came from, I mean, I had a million dollar net worth and [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=245.58s)]
*  I was making $20,000 a month in 1983. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=250.5s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=253.14000000000001s)]
*  That's rich. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=254.85999999999999s)]
*  Where were you driving? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=255.85999999999999s)]
*  A Jag. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=256.86s)]
*  That's what I always, because none of my friends could spell Jaguar, so I needed a Jaguar. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=257.86s)]
*  But I'd done stupid stuff and too much debt and the bank got sold, called our notes and [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=263.14s)]
*  spent the next three years of our life losing everything. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=267.65999999999997s)]
*  And that's what made me care about money to answer your question. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=270.94s)]
*  Wow, because yeah, because if you go to a high pretty early, that's wild. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=274.34s)]
*  So did you think at that point you thought, oh, this is it, life's just going to be a... [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=278.7s)]
*  Yeah, I thought I had it all dialed in and I had nothing dialed in. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=282.98s)]
*  Dang. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=287.14s)]
*  I was stupid on steroids, yeah. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=288.14s)]
*  And so we, yeah, with a brand new baby and a toddler and a marriage hanging on by the [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=289.94s)]
*  thread, we got the opportunity to start again in 1988, September 23rd. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=295.3s)]
*  Well, you remember it like that. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=301.02000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=302.82s)]
*  Well, I mean, that's the day we filed bankruptcy. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=303.82s)]
*  That's like, that's hell day, you know. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=304.82s)]
*  Do you have to go to the bank to file it or how do you do it? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=307.62s)]
*  No, it's a federal court. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=310.42s)]
*  It's a nice little procedure that you go through that's pretty intimidating. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=312.14s)]
*  And were you still like, was your dad still like a mentor at that point for business or [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=317.97999999999996s)]
*  anything? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=322.18s)]
*  No, no, they had moved away by then. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=323.18s)]
*  And I had guys around here that were, that were family friends and stuff that we'd grown [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=325.38s)]
*  up with. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=329.7s)]
*  But I had started a faith journey. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=330.7s)]
*  I'd met God and so as an adult, because I was pretty much a wild character in my youth. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=335.62s)]
*  So I started finding out that the Bible said something about money. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=342.14s)]
*  And then I started talking to old rich people. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=346.78s)]
*  And both of these things said, you know, just common sense. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=349.56s)]
*  Just live on less than you make. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=352.58s)]
*  Have a plan. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=354.86s)]
*  Get out of debt. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=355.94s)]
*  And, you know, I've got all these degrees and letters and licenses and crap after my [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=356.94s)]
*  name that says I'm supposed to know something about money, but I was broke. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=360.86s)]
*  And so I need a new set of information. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=363.78s)]
*  So I found common sense and started using it. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=366.0s)]
*  And then people started asking us, OK, how did you turn your life around after all that [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=368.72s)]
*  garbage? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=372.96s)]
*  And this is what we did. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=373.96s)]
*  And they went, can we do it? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=374.96s)]
*  I'm like, yeah. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=376.32s)]
*  And we start showing people. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=377.32s)]
*  And then, you know, 35 years later, here we are showing people, millions of them. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=378.32s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's unbelievable. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=382.72s)]
*  I mean, everybody knows Dave Ramsey and everybody's had, you know, has used you for financial [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=384.0s)]
*  guidance and stuff over the years or are going to you with certain questions. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=389.28000000000003s)]
*  I know you guys take so many questions on your show. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=393.96000000000004s)]
*  With that turnaround moment, was there like, did it lead you to be like, I need more than [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=396.35999999999996s)]
*  just believing that finances are going to take care of me or like? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=401.2s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's probably part of the part of the journey there. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=405.23999999999995s)]
*  I mean, somebody said, how did you bounce back? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=408.08s)]
*  And I'm like, dude, when you fall that far, you don't really bounce. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=409.96s)]
*  It's splat. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=412.28s)]
*  So we hit the water and ladders. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=414.35999999999996s)]
*  We sat around, whined and moaned and blamed everybody else for about a year and, you know, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=416.47999999999996s)]
*  figured out finally it wasn't everybody else's fault. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=421.44s)]
*  It's my fault. I caused it. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=423.84s)]
*  I'm the idiot signed up for the trip and got to take it. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=425.20000000000005s)]
*  So I had to, you know, I had to course correct and adjust. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=427.40000000000003s)]
*  And so, yeah, I think our faith, our new faith at that point, it was very young and tender [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=431.20000000000005s)]
*  and not a lot of knowledge or anything. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=437.72s)]
*  But anyway, we're we're just trying to figure out how do you navigate with two little babies [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=439.20000000000005s)]
*  and sitting here broke and, you know, my wife's from the hills of East Tennessee, frying pan [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=443.20000000000005s)]
*  throwing. There's an Olympic event. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=447.68s)]
*  You know, I mean, it's like a hillbilly woman. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=448.96000000000004s)]
*  So, oh, yeah, it was it was rough. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=450.96000000000004s)]
*  And so we both killed each other. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=453.08000000000004s)]
*  And I think she would have left, but she didn't have a car. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=454.68s)]
*  But yeah, the so I mean, that's the stuff that we did. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=458.76000000000005s)]
*  And but again, gradually, we just sat down with the yellow pad and said, OK, here's what [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=462.04s)]
*  we have coming in. We can't spend more than that. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=466.04s)]
*  And we're always going to give some. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=468.68s)]
*  We're always going to save some and we're going to feed ourselves. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=470.44s)]
*  And then what we do next and then the next week and then the next week. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=473.6s)]
*  And OK, now we got to get a little bit better and started gradually getting our income back [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=476.40000000000003s)]
*  up. And it was it was not a bounce back. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=481.96s)]
*  It was years, it feels like. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=485.12s)]
*  But then, you know, the thing about this stuff, this common sense thing, it's not a microwave. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=486.72s)]
*  It's a crock pot. Yeah, it cooks up good, but it takes a while. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=492.68s)]
*  It takes a long while. Yeah. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=496.36s)]
*  And then sometimes you realize you look in the thing, you're like, I don't even have this [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=498.24s)]
*  thing plugged in either. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=500.84000000000003s)]
*  There's that too. Yeah, there's that problem. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=502.84000000000003s)]
*  You're just sitting there watching a bowl of cold meat water for eight hours. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=505.04s)]
*  So it sounds like it's from experience. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=509.12s)]
*  But that's might have just happened. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=511.2s)]
*  Yeah, I've been through some things. Yeah. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=513.24s)]
*  Well, if you don't have a wife, you have a crock pot. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=515.0s)]
*  This is true. I mean, it's definitely. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=518.24s)]
*  And it's a sad day for a man when you realize you're like, oh, damn, this is, you know, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=520.4s)]
*  when you go in to get your crock pot, you know, that's signing up for it right there. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=525.72s)]
*  It is really. And you name or some people name it after a woman. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=530.92s)]
*  And I'm like, well, this is getting a little crazy, I feel like. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=535.32s)]
*  But when you look at like, you know, like when I think back on jobs that I had, like [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=537.56s)]
*  I was, you know, I sold what I used to sell hamsters outside of raves when I was young. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=542.8s)]
*  I've sold I worked in dairy. I sold Mexican food door to door. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=549.4399999999999s)]
*  I used to clean out wishing wells in our town. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=554.68s)]
*  We had a plethora of wells in our parish. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=557.04s)]
*  What else? Collecting cans and taking them over to the scales. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=561.76s)]
*  I sold Italian or semi Italian food, just all types of things. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=565.1999999999999s)]
*  And I try to offer suggestions to like people that were like me growing up. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=572.76s)]
*  Like, how do you find a job that could start to change? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=577.4s)]
*  Like if you don't have much and often go to like pressure washing, that's what I'll tell people. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=582.04s)]
*  You buy a pressure washing, get a pretty good one for about 600 bucks. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=588.4399999999999s)]
*  And then you can start a business. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=591.64s)]
*  You can make your day's lawn care cards and next, you know, two weeks later, you're a dang business owner. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=593.16s)]
*  You know, are there suggestions like you have like that for people that are like, you know, like, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=599.48s)]
*  and it can be a first job even like, what do I start? [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=604.88s)]
*  I mean, lawn care is a great one. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=606.76s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's amazing to me what people will pay you to do if you're just willing to go do it and you show up on time. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=608.76s)]
*  And then I think the piece that goes with that is, OK, you don't want to start pressure washing and go, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=616.04s)]
*  hey, I want to be 63 years old, which is what I am and still be pressure washing. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=621.8s)]
*  That's not a plan. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=625.8s)]
*  To get you through this week, you know, you know, a lot of pressure washing. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=627.36s)]
*  You're right. That you turn into a car detail company and then turn it into something else and then sell that and do something else. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=630.4s)]
*  And what I figured out was these wealthy people, they they don't think thank God it's Friday. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=636.12s)]
*  Oh, God, it's Monday. They're not living for the weekend. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=643.64s)]
*  Yeah, they're you know, every move they make is a step towards where I want to be in 10 years, where I want to who I want to become. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=647.56s)]
*  And so, OK, I might be pressure washing so I can get the money to go to code school and pay ten thousand bucks and go to code school. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=656.36s)]
*  Oh, then you can make one hundred fifty a year. Right. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=663.1999999999999s)]
*  And so what's the step? What's what's the method to get there? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=666.16s)]
*  What's the path to get there? And so the problem, I think sometimes if you take a feel like you're taking a job like that. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=669.8399999999999s)]
*  I've done all that. Not the exact same thing, but I've done a bunch of crappy jobs to an entrepreneurial things. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=675.52s)]
*  And, you know, I buy an old car repo lot and come home, fix it up, put it back on the market. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=681.16s)]
*  And back in those days, there were classified ads in the newspaper. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=685.96s)]
*  Oh, yeah. And so we'd sell turn around, sell the car and buy a bunch of junk at some auction. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=688.84s)]
*  I was there by the house, but I buy half the estate and then put it in turn into a garage sale. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=694.36s)]
*  Oh, yeah. You got a kind of honey act full of candelabras or something. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=698.32s)]
*  You get some you get some deals on stuff. And so it was a lot of fun. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=702.9200000000001s)]
*  I was horse trading. We called it growing up, but no horses involved. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=705.64s)]
*  But there was, you know, somebody knew how to buy something and flip it over or go to the police auction. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=708.88s)]
*  That was always a good. That's a lot of fun. There's some weird stuff there, man. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=712.52s)]
*  Is there? But yeah. And the all that stuff. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=716.2800000000001s)]
*  And so but it needs to be that that's not where you're staying. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=719.48s)]
*  It's a path of where you're going. And, you know, that changes everything. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=724.72s)]
*  It's like, you know, even your, you know, this meteoric, fabulous, famous career that you've done. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=729.0s)]
*  I mean, you're just, man, amazing. Congratulations. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=734.72s)]
*  And thanks. But I mean, there's a lot of bad comedy clubs in the line. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=737.8000000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah. With wrong people in the audience before you get to be the Theo van of today. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=745.24s)]
*  You know, there's a price to be paid to win. You know, you don't win. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=752.9200000000001s)]
*  You know, you're an overnight success. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=756.8s)]
*  Yeah, I worked my butt off for 30 years being overnight success. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=759.12s)]
*  You've worked your butt off for a decade plus to be an overnight success. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=762.0s)]
*  Yeah. And just because somebody found you on Netflix last week, that I mean, you just started on that. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=765.12s)]
*  Right. I don't know how it happened. Right. Yeah. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=769.3599999999999s)]
*  I mean, even when I think back, like I used to get all these comments, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=771.4s)]
*  I would get all the email cards and go before the shows and put them on all the tables [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=774.4399999999999s)]
*  so I could get back in touch with people. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=778.3599999999999s)]
*  I would buy like the CD or DVD burner and burn a DVD and then sell it after the show. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=780.68s)]
*  I'd burn it like I remember when I got a three disc burner so I can burn three at a time. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=786.9599999999999s)]
*  Wow. And what those sell for, man? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=792.0s)]
*  I had to, they were probably 300 bucks, 400 bucks. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=794.3199999999999s)]
*  Wow. Well, you could get that little stack. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=798.0s)]
*  I'm not talking about the burner. What were you selling the CDs for? [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=799.92s)]
*  Oh, the CDs for probably 10, but I'd take eight. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=802.0799999999999s)]
*  And volume discount too. If you want 10 of them to give for Christmas presents, I'll set you up. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=807.4399999999999s)]
*  Oh, I sold one to a lady one time. This was in Mishawaka, Indiana. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=812.16s)]
*  She bought one. She drove three hours home. She said it didn't work. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=815.44s)]
*  And she drove back the next day to come and change it. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=818.4000000000001s)]
*  I was like, it's just a dang $8. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=821.36s)]
*  She spent more on gas, but I guess it was just the point of making sure she got what she paid for, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=823.6800000000001s)]
*  which I understand. But yeah, when I think about all the different things [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=829.2800000000001s)]
*  or missing certain like events in people's lives or something to work, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=833.0400000000001s)]
*  sometimes I wish I'd had a little bit better balance, but also liked working. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=837.7600000000001s)]
*  You know, I think I really liked it. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=844.8000000000001s)]
*  But yeah, I don't think it's as easy as having like things evolve though, too. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=846.5600000000001s)]
*  Like one thing I'm thinking, say if you start a pressure washing, right, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=852.32s)]
*  you're going to start to learn how to do business. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=855.9200000000001s)]
*  That's something you don't realize you're going to learn by starting a business. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=858.32s)]
*  Sometimes is that you're going to learn how to do business. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=861.2s)]
*  And next thing you know, you might have an employee. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=863.84s)]
*  And then you're like, oh, wow, now I'm an employer. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=866.72s)]
*  I've never been an employer. What's that like? [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=869.44s)]
*  And you just learn like you'll do taxes and business that you'll file for LLC. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=871.36s)]
*  You'll do all these things. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=875.52s)]
*  And then you're just building up knowledge. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=876.48s)]
*  And then part of you or for me, I noticed will start to bloom a little bit and be like, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=878.72s)]
*  well, now what else do I want to do? [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=884.88s)]
*  Because you've seen one thing that you tried and started with, you've seen it work [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=887.12s)]
*  or not work even. You've learned that, hey, it didn't work out. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=891.44s)]
*  But yeah, the more like kind of steps you take into doing business, [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=895.52s)]
*  the more that you become somebody who walks like a business guy in some ways. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=899.52s)]
*  Well, you change your identity. You change who you are. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=905.36s)]
*  I mean, I'm not the little redneck hillbilly kid hell raisin that I was when I was in high school. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=907.92s)]
*  I got a lot less hair for one thing, but I'm also not that guy anymore. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=912.88s)]
*  From that matter, I've been married 43 years. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=916.4s)]
*  My wife's not married the same guy she married 43 years ago. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=918.0799999999999s)]
*  Thank God, because he wasn't much. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=920.56s)]
*  What kind of hair do you have? Something good? [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=923.92s)]
*  Not as good as yours. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=926.8s)]
*  I never got that, but I had that 70s thing going with the little feathers on the side. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=927.92s)]
*  You remember those? You don't remember them, but you've seen pictures. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=932.24s)]
*  Oh, yes. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=934.64s)]
*  Problem with the part down the middle is the part gets wide if you're not careful. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=935.1999999999999s)]
*  Dude, what would you say to like somebody who's going into business with a friend? [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=940.64s)]
*  That's one thing I think about a lot of times. What are things like a partnership with a friend? [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=944.88s)]
*  Right. Or starting a partnership with a new business person. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=948.4799999999999s)]
*  You can even be a spouse. What do you say, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=951.68s)]
*  like what are pitfalls that people can look out for in advance of that kind of stuff? [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=954.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, the biggest thing we run into, we coach about 10,000 businesses with the [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=958.4799999999999s)]
*  Entree Leadership brand, small businesses, and they're anywhere from five to 200 team members size. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=963.4399999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=968.64s)]
*  And so what I tell those guys, and I'll be speaking to them, we do an event with about 3,000 of them [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=969.1999999999999s)]
*  once a year. I'll be speaking to them in the next couple of weeks here. And so [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=975.1999999999999s)]
*  one of the things we tell them is really, you're beer drinking buddy and you're sitting around [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=980.0799999999999s)]
*  talking about opening a business is bad idea. You know, one of y'all needs to open it and the [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=984.24s)]
*  other one needs to work there and you can pay him out of the profits if you want, you can be generous, [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=988.72s)]
*  but somebody, anything with two heads is a monster and the only ship on sale is a partnership. So [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=993.04s)]
*  generally speaking, don't do a partnership generally. Now, if you're going to have friends [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=997.92s)]
*  work on your team, which I mean, I got a bunch of them on a bunch of my team is friends and they [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1001.52s)]
*  became friends while they're here or they were friends and then they came here. I've got family [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1005.84s)]
*  in the building. My kids work here in their thirties and so how do you navigate that? Well, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1010.32s)]
*  we had to learn from a family business perspective and it works for friends as well to separate the [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1017.0400000000001s)]
*  hat that we wear. And so my hat that I wear with my buddy, you know, it's friend and, you know, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1023.6800000000001s)]
*  we're having a scar together or playing golf or we're doing whatever, it says friend on it, right? [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1030.88s)]
*  Fantasy football. Yeah. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1035.6000000000001s)]
*  Whatever. And so, but when we're at work, my hat says CEO, right? And his says, you know, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1036.88s)]
*  technology or whatever. And so you do your job. I'll do my job and I'm going to treat you like [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1044.5600000000002s)]
*  I would treat the other team members because I treat them all nice and good and with dignity. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1051.92s)]
*  I don't yell and scream because of people. So I mean, we treat them right. And you're going to [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1057.0400000000002s)]
*  treat me with the same respect that you would if you worked in a place where the CEO walked in the [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1061.2s)]
*  room. Not that you bow or something like that, but you don't roll your eyes and go, you know, [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1067.1200000000001s)]
*  use friend talk at your CEO. Yeah. And so you change hats. You can't run up and tickle them [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1072.0800000000002s)]
*  or whatever. Well, that's strange, but yeah. But the idea of being like my kids, you know, [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1076.8s)]
*  my daughter, Rachel Cruz is a huge personality, three, four number one bestsellers and, you know, [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1086.32s)]
*  speaks all over America, is constantly on the network TV and stuff. And we've got eight of those [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1092.48s)]
*  people that are personalities that do different things. And so she gets paid, not as my daughter, [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1098.1599999999999s)]
*  but based on the work that she does there. And then when I'm, you know, she's got three of my [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1104.32s)]
*  grandkids. So when I got Papa Dave hat on, when I'm with the grandbabies at Thanksgiving dinner, [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1110.8s)]
*  but when we're here, I'm dealing with her. Everybody in the room knows she's my daughter, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1115.9199999999998s)]
*  but I treat her the same way I would treat Dr. John Delaney or Ken Coleman, the other personalities [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1120.72s)]
*  as well. So you just got to separate that and wear different hats. So when you're wearing your friend [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1125.6s)]
*  hat and act that way, and you know, when you're at work, you're wearing this hat and you know, [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1130.1599999999999s)]
*  you've got to perform, I got to perform. And so family doesn't get a pass and friend doesn't [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1134.72s)]
*  get a pass for incompetence or, you know, just, I'm not going to come to work today. No, that's [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1140.56s)]
*  not how we were all coming to work today. Yeah. Yeah. If you are going into business with a friend, [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1145.12s)]
*  what are something that people can like, what discussions need to be had up front? So you're [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1150.48s)]
*  going into a partnership with a buddy, you know, so you don't run into lawsuits down the line. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1154.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Well, you may, nothing you do keeps you from, I mean, people can file a lawsuit for anything, [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1159.44s)]
*  even if it's not true, they can just make up something. So it's, and they do, [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1166.0s)]
*  we've run into that. But what we tell folks, if you're going to do a partnership, make sure [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1170.5600000000002s)]
*  you got really good documentation. And the best thing you can do is talk through and have in the [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1174.0800000000002s)]
*  document, all the bad things that can happen. And a lot of them are D's, divorce, drug use, [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1179.68s)]
*  disinterest, I don't want to work anymore, disability, death, you know, what happens [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1188.16s)]
*  when these things happen? So, cause you may be just great working with your buddy and he owns [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1195.1200000000001s)]
*  half the company, but his wife's cuckoo and he dies. Now you're, now you're partnered with cuckoo. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1200.56s)]
*  Yeah. You know, that's a bad plan. So you need to have this laid out. What's going to happen in [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1207.28s)]
*  these situations? I mean, you know, I've had, I had a guy working here that was one of our top [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1211.92s)]
*  leaders many years ago, got MS. He's driving home, six miles home, got lost on the way home, [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1218.3200000000002s)]
*  brain lesions. And so he obviously became disabled. So what happens to that guy? He was one of my top [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1225.44s)]
*  guys. He was, you know, he's paid off the bottom line, like he was a partner and just a wonderful [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1233.3600000000001s)]
*  man. He's passed away now. And, but you know, how do you treat him? How do you treat his family [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1238.32s)]
*  in the worst case scenario and how are you going to take care of them? And cause you'd want to take [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1243.9199999999998s)]
*  care of your buddy. You want your buddy's kids to be homeless cause something happened to him. If [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1248.0s)]
*  he's your partner, in this case, this guy was my, one of my right arms, you know, so you just gotta [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1252.6399999999999s)]
*  think that stuff through because it's going to come, something's going to come at you. And if [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1257.36s)]
*  you haven't anticipated it, cause everybody goes into this stuff like, Oh, it's all going to work. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1262.32s)]
*  Nothing works like it's supposed to work ever. It never works. It's never as easy as it sounds [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1266.88s)]
*  when you're sitting and talking about it the first time. Yeah. Yeah. Where did you find yourself [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1271.92s)]
*  having unrealistic expectations about going into business spaces? That's, that's some things that [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1276.4s)]
*  I've struggled with in my life, especially recently. It's like just unrealistic expectations that [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1280.96s)]
*  things are going to work or that they should be a certain way, like not leaving space for [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1285.44s)]
*  anything really trying to just really have a lot of my own will, I guess, in some ways it is, [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1291.92s)]
*  but also it's just, you know, observing you from the outside, I think you probably suffer from [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1295.68s)]
*  this intense desire to be excellent. Yeah. And all that means is you're excellent. And so if you [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1302.3200000000002s)]
*  demand that of yourself, it's okay to demand that of the situation of the project and even the people. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1310.96s)]
*  I work my tail off. And so I don't hesitate if somebody's not to go, Hey, come on, pick it up. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1316.3200000000002s)]
*  Right. You know, it's not like I'm kicking back and asking you to go to now I'm going. Right. So [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1324.0s)]
*  keep up. Right. And same thing with a project we get on these projects now. So I do, I have, [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1329.6s)]
*  I still have unrealistic expectations. I do have a reality perception after 30 freaking years of [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1334.8s)]
*  doing stupid stuff. Yeah. I mean, I'm convinced we've survived about 90% of our ideas that [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1341.36s)]
*  everything that good that's happened to happen on about 10% of them. But when you're starting it, [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1347.12s)]
*  I mean, you're going for a walk in the morning and, you know, or you're sitting on the dock, [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1350.88s)]
*  having a cup of coffee at the lake and you have this idea, they're all good then, you know, but [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1356.72s)]
*  when you're, you know, half a million dollars in and you go, Oh, this sucks. This is awful. And so [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1361.44s)]
*  you've come to the realization that even though we demanded excellence, even though we drove the lane, [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1367.6000000000001s)]
*  put the ball in the hoop, even though we didn't have product market fit, something's off, pricing's [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1371.2800000000002s)]
*  off, something's off. And I mean, but if you're, if you're not trying stuff, you're not growing, [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1375.76s)]
*  right? You got to try stuff, but you're gonna, you're gonna screw up a lot of it, even though [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1382.16s)]
*  you demand excellence. But I don't have a hesitation at all expecting excellence and, and expecting it, [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1386.08s)]
*  you know, why would you enter something you didn't think was gonna work? Of course we think it's [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1392.8s)]
*  gonna work. Yeah. You know, like a stupid reporter those days, like, did you ever have any idea it [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1396.16s)]
*  would be this big? And I'm like, well, of course I did. I'm getting people out of death. There's [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1400.72s)]
*  everybody is my market, you know, of course I've thought it, but what I didn't know is how much [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1405.6799999999998s)]
*  work it was gonna be. I didn't have any idea I was going to have a hundred million dollars in payroll. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1409.76s)]
*  You know, I didn't have any idea that it was going to take that to do it, but I knew there was a lot [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1414.08s)]
*  of need. I knew that it could be big, but I didn't, I didn't know what, how bad it was going to be, [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1417.6799999999998s)]
*  how hard it was going to be. Yeah. I think that's the thing that, you know what? That's funny when [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1422.32s)]
*  I hear you say that, cause yeah, as I, as like, I started to get busier with stuff that was business, [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1426.08s)]
*  I just wanted to be a comedian, you know, and then got into podcasting and then you have an [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1431.04s)]
*  employee, then you have employees and then they have feelings and, and you have, and you have [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1435.28s)]
*  relationships with them, you know? And so, and so it's like all these things next thing, you know, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1442.3999999999999s)]
*  it's like, I spend a lot of my day, most of your time gets gone kind of because you have, there's [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1447.04s)]
*  another responsibility. And so then I'm just like, man, I'm just, I never, I didn't expect this much [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1452.72s)]
*  more work to come out of, I think just having some goals, you know? Yeah. Yeah. I thought I was [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1458.88s)]
*  going to be on the radio and sell some books on getting out of debt. And I mean, who knew I needed [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1465.3600000000001s)]
*  400 people in tech, in a tech department, you know? And so it's the same thing. You're exactly [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1470.0s)]
*  right. And, and, but the good news is, is that it, like you said earlier, it's an opportunity to [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1475.0400000000002s)]
*  learn opportunity to grow. That way you don't just stay in the pressure washing business. And [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1479.2s)]
*  so I, I still enjoy the stage. I still enjoy the being on the radio and the podcast, the YouTube [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1485.2800000000002s)]
*  every day, we still do that show every day, three hours a day. I still enjoy all that stuff, but [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1492.4s)]

*  entrepreneurial side is fun. Yeah. Elevate every morning with Tommy John second skin underwear. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1510.24s)]

*  a t-shirt online, my friend Kevin made it in his basement and he would ship it out. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1592.08s)]
*  And then, um, and then it grew and people wanted a different shirt and we put up something else and [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1598.08s)]
*  then a hoodie. And then we had sometimes to have more. And sometimes we had too much and [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1603.6s)]

*  approach an employer about that kind of stuff? Like, you know, a lot of stuff in business like [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1669.3600000000001s)]
*  that or relationship things, if you'll just switch the moccasins a minute, where are their moccasins? [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1673.84s)]
*  So if you weren't, if you were the supervisor, are you the owner of the business? [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1678.24s)]
*  How would you want someone to talk to you about it? And so, I mean, I really appreciate when our [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1683.2s)]
*  folks come in and go, Hey, you know, I'm making this and you know, here's two or three positions [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1688.8s)]
*  in the marketplace that are more for the same position. And so, you know, what I'm curious [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1694.0s)]
*  about is what I can do to be worth what those people are doing, because I want to be worth more [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1700.16s)]
*  to the business. And if they say it that way, oh man, yeah, I'm like, yeah, okay, here. Yeah. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1704.8s)]
*  Well, matter of fact, you know, we probably have overlooked that we probably just need to give you [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1709.36s)]
*  a raise. But, but maybe, yeah, maybe there's three things you need to do to level up to be ready to [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1712.4s)]
*  do that. And so it's an opportunity for growth and those kinds of things. Because really this, [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1716.8s)]
*  you know, if you're an employer, your team has to make you more or save you more than they cost. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1720.88s)]
*  Or by definition, you go out of business mathematically. Yeah. And so if you'll look [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1729.5200000000002s)]
*  at that as a team members, like how can I add more value than I cost or save more money and [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1733.6000000000001s)]
*  depend on what they're working on, but then then I cost then, you know, it's kind of a no brainer, [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1741.0400000000002s)]
*  unless the employers are jerking greedy or whatever. But most employers are just trying [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1746.64s)]
*  to figure it out too. We're just trying to go, especially small business people. I mean, we love [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1750.64s)]
*  our people, their family to us. And, you know, we want to, we want to help them win. We want their [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1754.88s)]
*  family, with their kids to go to college. We want to be with them 20 years and watch them grow up. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1759.44s)]
*  You know, we want all that good stuff for you. But we also don't want to close because we overpaid [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1763.5200000000002s)]
*  everybody and didn't make any stinking money. Yeah. So then everybody loses. So you've got this [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1768.96s)]
*  balance. The employer's got that stress they're carrying. So if you'll keep that in mind, when [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1773.2s)]
*  you're asking, how can I add value that's more than I cost or save you more than I cost, then [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1777.04s)]
*  like I've got a lady in logistics. I mean, she saved us several hundred thousand dollars with [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1785.8400000000001s)]
*  contract negotiations with our logistics people on the shipping more than she cost. Wow. Well, [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1791.3600000000001s)]
*  it's easy to say, yeah, you're worth that. That's a no brainer. I like sharing with her. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1796.96s)]
*  I mean, we always tell people around here, if you kill it and drag it home, you know, go out there, [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1802.96s)]
*  kill it, drag it to the cave. I'll share it with you. Let's figure it out. You know, you bring in [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1806.56s)]
*  a million dollars in revenue. We can probably devy that up. We can probably figure out something to [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1810.48s)]
*  do with that. Yeah. I don't need to take it all home, but also don't need to give it all to one [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1814.16s)]
*  person either. So we figured this out. And you can do that when you're adding value. And so just look [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1819.04s)]
*  at it that way. Not like on the other hand, I had a guy come in years ago, long time ago, [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1824.96s)]
*  and he'd been to school half his life. He had more degrees than a thermometer. And he just, [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1830.64s)]
*  you know, he said, Hey, man, you know, at these big companies, people, they got this many degrees, [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1835.68s)]
*  they make certain amount of money. And he said, I'm not making that here. We need to adjust my [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1842.3200000000002s)]
*  income. And I said, Well, dude, I'm sorry, this is a small business, your raises effective when you [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1849.44s)]
*  are. We don't pay you for degrees, we pay you for bringing in more than you cost. And right now [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1853.92s)]
*  you're not. So, you know, he left and went and worked for corporate America where they'll pay [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1862.64s)]
*  him for those degrees and they can get away with that. But small business can't do that. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1867.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. What do you say? Like, what is some of the added or even just like the to get a little [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1870.64s)]
*  bit more minute with it? Like, what are just say somebody's out there listening to like, man, I [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1875.44s)]
*  feel like I want to talk to my boss about a razor. I want to how do they? What are some? Should they [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1879.92s)]
*  tell themselves certain things to prep themselves to go in there? If they should it just be [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1885.3600000000001s)]
*  comfortable? Because it's just a space where a lot of people get really uncomfortable, I think, [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1890.24s)]
*  you know? Yeah, you know, anytime I'm in a situation like that, where I'm uncomfortable, [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1893.68s)]
*  where there's conflict or a negotiation, if you want to call it that. I found that the more options [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1898.5600000000002s)]
*  I have, the calmer I am. And so if there's only one thing, I mean, if I don't get this, I'm dead. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1904.56s)]
*  But if you got like six people wanting to hire you, and, you know, you want to go in and go, [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1911.44s)]
*  hey, I, you know, I'd like to stay. And I like it here. And I like you want to work. But I got all [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1917.12s)]
*  this other stuff. Your body language changes, you know, you're, you're not, you don't have to be [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1923.2s)]
*  cocky about it. You know, if swagger in or something. But, but you can come in with a lot [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1927.6s)]
*  of confidence if you've got options. But if you've got it all dialed in, it's just one thing. And [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1931.12s)]
*  if I don't get this one thing, the whole thing's over and you add this drama, then you tighten up. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1935.28s)]
*  Yeah, you can feel that energy in there. And it changes the, changes the conversation. Your vocal [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1939.6s)]
*  chords change even. Yeah. Yeah. And there can be things, even if it's not financial, you could get, [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1944.08s)]
*  well, can you, is there a possibility that my car could be paid or insurance? I think there's always [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1949.36s)]
*  different possibilities of things you can ask for even that, you know? Yeah. I mean, depending on [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1953.6799999999998s)]
*  how the business is structured and what's going on, there's a lot of different things you can do [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1958.24s)]
*  and to help people and do different things. And sometimes we've had situations where someone was [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1961.92s)]
*  just in a financial situation, you know, they got in trouble and they come in, we sit down, [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1966.64s)]
*  we go over their budget and we go, okay, number one, we're going to get you in a situation. So [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1972.0s)]
*  you're never here again with your budget, how you're handling your money. But then number two, [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1975.28s)]
*  you know, your house is four payments behind, so we're going to catch the house up. And so that's [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1981.2s)]
*  just like a one-time thing. It's not a permanent raise because the raise wasn't the problem. Their [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1985.52s)]
*  mismanagement at home was the problem. So, you know, we help them fix the mismanagement and then [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1989.76s)]
*  we catch them up. Now they're at even, now they can run. Yeah. Would you buy it? Do you still think [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=1994.56s)]
*  it's good to buy a house? I'm a homeowner, right? Like for the first time, like last year or two [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2001.12s)]
*  years ago. And sometimes I'm like, is this the best thing to do? Like, it's tougher to have like [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2005.84s)]
*  freedom to just go where you want, you know, you can't just go. And then sometimes it feels [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2013.68s)]
*  like there's so many expenses with a home. Sometimes it feels like, I'm not saying it's true, [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2017.6000000000001s)]
*  but it feels like I'm not really building up any equity or saving money. What do you think about [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2022.72s)]
*  it, Dave? Well, again, the scope, over the scope of time, you're making money without a doubt. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2028.96s)]
*  By owning a home? Absolutely. I mean, again, I'm old, so I've gotten to see this thing happen. You [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2033.76s)]
*  know, I mean, I got my real estate license three weeks after I turned 18 years old in 1978. And the [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2040.8s)]
*  first house I sold was to a buddy of mine from high school, which means he wasn't smart because [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2046.08s)]
*  he let me sell him my house and I'm stupid. And you're like, I'm going to live in one of the rooms, [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2049.84s)]
*  buddy. I just want you to know straight up. How's this going? But yeah, anyway, I sold him that [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2055.6s)]
*  house for 42,500 bucks and it's on Eastridge over in Antioch. And that house today would be probably [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2060.4s)]
*  800. Wow. So, you know, and if you bought a house four years ago, you've gotten in Nashville, [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2069.04s)]
*  I mean, you made serious money on it in four years in terms of value increase. But yeah, [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2075.68s)]
*  the nickel dime expenses, the messing with the repairs, I mean, crap, the more stuff you own, [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2080.8s)]
*  the more repairmen you have to know. I mean, it doesn't matter what it is, whether it's got a motor [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2086.0s)]
*  in it or it's cars or houses or boats or all this stuff. Something's always freaking breaking. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2090.7200000000003s)]
*  There's always something screwed up that and it does get the feeling of just the hassle and [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2095.6s)]
*  the aggravation. There's no simplicity to it at all. Your life gets more complicated. So be [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2100.7999999999997s)]
*  careful what you wish for. Yeah. But homeownership in general, absolutely. We did the largest study [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2105.8399999999997s)]
*  of millionaires ever done in North America. I saw that. And the typical millionaire that we found, [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2111.52s)]
*  89% of them were first generation, meaning they did not inherit their money. It's not how they [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2118.96s)]
*  became millionaires. So nine out of 10, that's good news for everybody. We all got a shot. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2124.56s)]
*  Right. But the two things that got them there was simply putting money in their 401k and buying a [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2128.64s)]
*  house and paying it off. And so I'd meet a guy, he's 42 and he owes, he had a house of six or [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2135.04s)]
*  700,000 bucks and he had like six or 800,000 bucks in his 401k and he's 42 years old. So he's [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2143.12s)]
*  worth over a million dollars and he paid off his house. So homeownership is a key part of the first [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2148.7999999999997s)]
*  one to $10 million of net worth that somebody builds. And so yeah, I'm a huge believer in [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2154.88s)]
*  homeownership. Don't do it stupid because buying a house you can't afford makes you broker. That's [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2161.52s)]
*  why they call them brokers. But it's a problem. Yeah. Yeah. This is your study right here. How [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2166.4s)]
*  do you come upon these millionaires? You know, we did a detailed study and sent out not just from us, [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2171.84s)]
*  but we just went to the population and found them. We had a research firm in New York City [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2179.52s)]
*  looking over our shoulder to make sure our research methodology was tight because we knew [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2185.04s)]
*  we'd get a ton of pushback from people who think that America is dead and there's no chance for [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2189.2s)]
*  anybody to win. You can't get up off the bottom. Little man can't get ahead, that whole thing. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2197.2s)]
*  And so- You're saying that's not true. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2201.52s)]
*  The problem is little man gets ahead every day in America. We see it right here. And I've met them [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2202.88s)]
*  for 30, 40 years doing this. I run into them and some of them did it because they did our stuff, [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2207.68s)]
*  but some of them just said, I'm going to live on less than I make. And it was an interesting [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2212.24s)]
*  result. So these are the top five careers of the millionaires that you guys looked at? [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2219.6s)]
*  Yep. Engineer, accountant. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2223.52s)]
*  What we found was what occurred most often. Engineer was number one. The most often occurring [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2224.72s)]
*  among the people we surveyed that were millionaires was engineer. Number two is accountant. Number [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2231.2s)]
*  three was teacher, which is surprising. Number three is management business. Number five is attorney. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2235.2s)]
*  Medical doctor didn't even make the top five. And we always think of doctors and lawyers, [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2240.7999999999997s)]
*  but they're actually number six, but they're notoriously bad with money. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2244.64s)]
*  They make a lot of money, but they're like music stars or something. They're notoriously bad with [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2248.56s)]
*  money. And so that was interesting. We couldn't figure out at first what these things had in [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2253.6s)]
*  common because they don't seem to have anything in common. What we finally figured out is all [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2259.3599999999997s)]
*  five of these are process people. You follow a process, a set of rules, and you learn the rules [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2264.32s)]
*  and you follow the rules. You're an engineer. There's only one way to build that building and [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2272.32s)]
*  it doesn't fall. If you're an accountant, it's not art. You don't get to make up how you do [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2277.2000000000003s)]
*  accounting. There's one way to do it. Teachers have a lesson plan they have to follow. Business [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2282.48s)]
*  has always a set of best practices. Attorneys, there's the law, and you can only conduct [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2287.36s)]
*  yourself in court a certain way or the judge will smack you backwards. All of these are process [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2294.16s)]
*  people. So they discovered because of the way their brain work that led them into these careers, [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2300.08s)]
*  they discovered the process of living on less than they make, living on a budget, starting to invest, [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2306.3199999999997s)]
*  being generous, paying off their house, that kind of stuff. And they follow that process and that's [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2310.24s)]
*  what got them there. The interesting thing is one third of them, 33%, made less than 100,000 a year. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2315.2799999999997s)]
*  They were not making bank. They were not earning their way into it really. Yeah, because you would [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2322.56s)]
*  think teachers, you always hear we got to pay these teachers more, you know. And we do. I mean, [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2326.8s)]
*  that wouldn't be bad at all. But there's the way the teachers' brains work, they do process, [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2330.7200000000003s)]
*  and that's the secret sauce. And all of those, I guess you have to have an education for. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2336.32s)]
*  Well, that's true. We have to go to college. Do you have to go to college to be a teacher? I [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2343.28s)]
*  don't know if you have to. You do? Yeah, definitely. Sorry teachers, I didn't. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2346.48s)]
*  Some of mine didn't go. Some of mine. Some of yours didn't go to class. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2350.96s)]
*  Some of mine didn't either. Some of mine would be in classes with me. I was like, what? [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2355.44s)]
*  It's like Rick Flair came on here one time and he said he was in a rehab facility for drugs and [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2360.64s)]
*  alcohol. And he looks over one day at lunch and one of the doctors is also in the facility. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2365.2s)]
*  That's not a good sign. Yeah, I was like, well, that's definitely, you're at a Hooters, bro. I'm [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2372.0s)]
*  like, you're just at a Hooters. Yeah, that's what the people say a lot of times is it does [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2376.4s)]
*  feel like that now. There's a lot of energy in there. It feels like the American dream isn't [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2382.56s)]
*  possible, that it doesn't exist. Where do you think a lot of that energy comes from? [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2388.8s)]
*  It feels like that's the consensus these days. Would you agree with that? It feels like that? [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2397.6800000000003s)]
*  There's a lot of loud people that have that. I don't know that it's necessarily a consensus [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2402.24s)]
*  among Americans. Because consensus means that most people agree with it? Right. Okay. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2410.3999999999996s)]
*  I'm not sure of that, but there's enough people that are making noise in that regard. But there [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2414.8799999999997s)]
*  kind of always has been. I mean, if you go back to the 70s with the hippie movement, it was the same [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2418.7999999999997s)]
*  kind of thing. Right. And so there's always been a, you know, my group, the Baby Boomers. And so [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2424.7999999999997s)]
*  there's always been somebody in the group that felt like the system was rigged. Man, we got to [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2429.68s)]
*  get the system, you know? Yeah. We can't beat the system. The little man can't get ahead. And so [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2434.8799999999997s)]
*  the neighborhood I grew up in, people say that, you know, and they never said it with like [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2439.6s)]
*  enthusiasm. It's like the little man can't get ahead. Like Eeyore is their spirit animal. Oh, [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2442.56s)]
*  yeah. Where's my tail? Yeah, it's just that. I'm stuck and life's bad. And, you know, no, you're [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2447.3599999999997s)]
*  not. Get up off your butt and go get a pressure washer. I mean, there's stuff to do, you know? So [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2454.48s)]
*  and most of these people, again, these millionaires, and a million dollars is not, [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2459.28s)]
*  that's not a billion dollars. That's a million. There's a lot of difference. Millionaires don't [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2465.6000000000004s)]
*  have jets. Millionaires don't have seven cars and four houses. No. You know, they just got, [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2470.4s)]
*  they've just got a paid four house and some money in their retirement. That's what it amounts to. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2476.2400000000002s)]
*  And so there's a, people kind of have a different mindset there and they think, okay, [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2480.48s)]
*  I can't be like this rock star. Well, you might not be. There's not as many billionaires as there [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2484.64s)]
*  are millionaires. Yeah. So, but anyway, can it be done? Yes, it can be done. And there is, [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2489.52s)]
*  there's a lot of loud noises out there. I don't know where that comes from. It's a, [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2493.2799999999997s)]
*  I think it starts with, and one of the reasons I pushed back and did this study, and then we [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2497.6s)]
*  ended up doing a number one, but song book on it, Baby Steps of Millionaires, pushing back in the [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2502.24s)]
*  marketplaces against those voices is because they're not, it's not true that you can't get ahead. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2506.48s)]
*  And when you convince someone that it's true, you're stealing their hope. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2513.44s)]
*  And you shouldn't steal people's hope, man. That's evil. Yeah. And so you ought to encourage [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2517.44s)]
*  people to go do stuff. Now you should not encourage them to go on American Idol if they can't sing. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2522.64s)]
*  Yeah. Okay. But you should, you know, so stop their nightmares, but also encourage their dreams. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2527.7599999999998s)]
*  So this hopelessness that goes with that, I feel stuck. I, I'll never get a house. I'm a, [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2532.96s)]
*  a Gen Z. I'm a millennial. I can't get ahead in today's world. You boomers bought your house for [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2539.44s)]
*  two baskets of strawberries. And so now I'm stuck and you don't understand. And, and housing is so [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2544.96s)]
*  expensive. Honey, it's always been expensive. I was doing an interview on NPR the other day, [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2550.2400000000002s)]
*  and the lady said, you know, I was riding with the Uber driver and the Uber driver said his daughter [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2555.84s)]
*  is a dancer and a barista, and she couldn't get a house. And I went, that's been true in every [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2559.84s)]
*  generation. Yeah. If you serve coffee and you're in Nashville and you're a dancer. Yeah. I think [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2567.44s)]
*  that's just going to be, that's not, those are not, you know, career fields that you're going to make [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2574.32s)]
*  enough to be able to afford a house. That's not, that's not a new thing. That doesn't mean the [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2579.28s)]
*  system has failed. Yeah. And who's buying Java off a stripper either, you know, to be honest, [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2582.32s)]
*  I'm not saying I didn't say what kind of dancer I didn't, I didn't have any idea there, but yeah. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2588.16s)]
*  Oh, okay. Yeah. I thought, yeah, I didn't know. But yeah, like who also, I guess it would be nice [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2591.6s)]
*  if a stripper just shows up at a nice cup of coffee. Actually, that's probably not a bad deal. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2596.08s)]
*  Don't they have that nude barista drive through or something? Where's that at? You know, that is a [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2601.7599999999998s)]
*  thing. That's right. Yeah. That's a while back. That's old news. Yeah. It's old news, but it [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2606.96s)]
*  definitely still, I think some people pretend like it's new news every day when they roll up there. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2610.96s)]
*  Let me see the headlines. Huh? I'm not sure exactly how we got there, but okay. Well, yeah, [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2617.2s)]
*  but I'm just saying that's a unique business right there. That's kind of wild, you know, [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2622.48s)]
*  that would be definitely. But the back to your thing, the thing is hope is a decision [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2626.0s)]
*  and it's got to be based on, you know, you've had the actual reality in your life of going from [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2634.56s)]
*  collecting cans to sitting here. I've had the reality in my life of going from mowing grass [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2642.96s)]
*  to millionaire in my twenties to losing it all. I'm so dumb. I had to do it twice. Damn. So, [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2650.24s)]
*  you know, I've got that reality. And so when someone says it can't be done, I went, uh, [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2655.8399999999997s)]
*  wait a minute. Hello. Um, and I don't really, I'm fairly smart, but I'm not a rocket surgeon. I mean, [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2661.8399999999997s)]
*  I don't, I don't really know how to do stuff. I just, I'm figuring it out as I go. Right. And, [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2669.04s)]
*  and so I think anybody can do it. No, it's good to hear. Yeah. I think people having a hope like [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2674.4s)]
*  that is important, you know, and I think that's, yeah, it's just really important to hear that, [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2680.2400000000002s)]
*  yeah. If you take away somebody's hope, cause I guess that's what a lot of this, [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2685.6000000000004s)]
*  this, uh, these loud voices are doing. Right. I never thought about that that much. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2688.96s)]
*  They're just trying to take away hope. Cause once they have your hope, they can kind of keep you [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2693.28s)]
*  there. I feel like if they're running us, if they're running a game, you know, and they're, [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2697.84s)]
*  they're manipulating this one thing and that's particularly evil. But the other one is just, [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2702.32s)]
*  they really have lost hope. And so they're angry and they don't want, and they want to loudly [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2708.0s)]
*  proclaim that it's not possible, which makes them feel okay that they're not winning, [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2714.0800000000004s)]
*  that they haven't gone and done something yet. And cause winning is hard, man. It's hard. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2718.32s)]
*  Yeah. It takes a lot of work, man. Yeah. I was talking, they had a kid rock was on a couple [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2722.8s)]
*  weeks ago and he was talking about how, um, yeah, if you want to re if you want to have success, [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2727.28s)]
*  you're going to have to probably work 60 hours a week, six, you know, 60 to 80 hours a week, [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2734.32s)]
*  he was saying. And for a period of time, not your whole life. Right. I mean, we started this thing, [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2738.2400000000002s)]
*  man, I was 16 hours. My wife had, you know, and she's like, I was a single mom for two years, [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2742.7200000000003s)]
*  you know, you were gone. I was on the road doing book tours. I was out speaking everywhere. I was [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2748.2400000000002s)]
*  going crazy going to cities, trying to get radio stations to carry the show back when talk radio [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2753.04s)]
*  was the thing. And that's how we all got started was in talk radio. Oh yeah. Do you ever meet Paul [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2757.44s)]
*  Harvey? Uh, no, I didn't. No, I didn't. I wish I had. I know y'all's timeline is iconic. Yeah. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2761.84s)]
*  I knew all the guys that are current rush and Sean Hannity and all those guys are all contemporaries [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2768.32s)]
*  and they're all friends and, um, you know, people that have been around the business like that, but, [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2774.0s)]
*  and a lot of the new guys that are doing really good work too. But anyway, that, you know, [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2780.0s)]
*  we're just out there hustling, man. And you got to leave the cave, kill it, drag it home. And [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2784.1600000000003s)]
*  my wife grew up on a farm. So she's like, um, yeah, hard works, how you do this. So get after it. Now, [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2788.4s)]
*  you can't maintain that. I was two years. It wasn't 20, 20. I would have lost my family. Yeah. You [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2794.8s)]
*  know, you can't, you can't maintain relationships. My kids would have been messed up. And so by the [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2800.6400000000003s)]
*  time my kids got on up, I, you know, I didn't miss a prom. I didn't miss a hockey game. You know, [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2804.96s)]
*  I didn't miss a whatever the big games. I mean, little stuff I'd be gone during the week, but, [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2811.36s)]
*  you know, but we started putting these dates on the calendar and we would book our events around [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2815.76s)]
*  them. You couldn't, you couldn't book on top of that. And I still do that. Yeah. Um, when people [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2819.6s)]
*  talk about, uh, when people talk, like you hear a lot of discussion these days about, um, how [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2825.36s)]
*  inflation is going, is getting so, is growing so fast, I guess that it's not that the wage, [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2832.08s)]
*  minimum wage isn't keeping up with it. Um, it feels like detrimental. Like if you, like, [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2840.56s)]
*  it feels sometimes impossible. If you look at the minimum wage, you're like, how is this going to, [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2845.7599999999998s)]
*  it would feel impossible almost. I feel like if you were trying to take care of a family or [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2850.56s)]
*  something on that, you know? Well, truthfully, uh, minimum wage has, uh, never, I don't think [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2854.8s)]
*  since even it was formed in the seventies, I don't think any time in history, minimum wage has been [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2862.96s)]
*  enough to take care of a family. Uh, so you've always had to think beyond minimum wage. If you [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2868.1600000000003s)]
*  wanted to excel, if you wanted to have, you know, a build some wealth or B just take care of a [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2872.96s)]
*  family, those kinds of things. So minimum wage is not designed for the entry level jobs are, [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2878.48s)]
*  that's not designed. What's more disturbing than minimum wage is the, that wages in general, [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2883.92s)]
*  average household incomes have not kept up with inflation. And so that's, that's more alarming [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2890.56s)]
*  because that's the whole population. It's not just this segment that enters, you know, entry level [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2897.44s)]
*  stuff at minimum wage, because, you know, if we go all the way back to minimum wage, I'm cutting [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2902.48s)]
*  grass for $3 a yard in 1972. Okay. A thousand there are dinosaurs in the yard. We had to get [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2906.16s)]
*  them out of the yard. But, you know, I mean, 1972, $3 a yard, but minimum wage was a buck 65. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2913.44s)]
*  My buddy's working at, at, you know, Burger King, flopping whoppers, and he's making a buck six, [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2918.7999999999997s)]
*  five. If I can cut that $3 a yard in an hour, I'm making double minimum wage at 12 years old. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2924.0s)]
*  And that's how my little math brain was working. So I'm running that mower, you know, I'm going. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2930.4s)]
*  And so, uh, so you can even cut somebody's yard and just go to the dorm like, Hey, just cut your [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2935.36s)]
*  yard. No, I mean, that was my job. I, there were one of my clients. I had to go cut their grass. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2939.76s)]
*  But some people, I bet if you rolled up to my door and knocked on my door and said, Hey man, [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2945.44s)]
*  I just cut your yard. Will you give me 10 bucks for it or whatever? Except for that other guy. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2948.56s)]
*  You hired to do it. That's coming next week. Yeah. There's a problem with him, but yeah, but yeah, [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2953.1200000000003s)]
*  the, uh, but yeah, I mean that, that you've never, you've always had the opportunity to beat minimum [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2957.76s)]
*  wage. So you don't want to sit and say, okay, minimum wage is my gauge of whether I can go win [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2963.12s)]
*  because I can go do something that beats minimum wage. Right. So that's kind of a, [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2969.2799999999997s)]
*  sometimes that's kind of a political football that gets kicked around a lot, I guess then, [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2972.96s)]
*  you know, it is, and it enters into this discussion falsely. It's a false narrative [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2976.64s)]
*  where I think the real narrative that is a little bit scary is that wages have not kept up with [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2981.6s)]
*  inflation. And because we've had this unusual surge in inflation and it's blamed on Biden [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2985.84s)]
*  politically, but it, some of it's his fault, uh, his, uh, policy issues, but most of it is just the, [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=2993.36s)]
*  the lingering results of the pandemic. And so the shortage shortages of things always drive prices [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3001.04s)]
*  up on anything, anything there's a shortage of prices go up. Okay. And there was a shortage of [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3008.1600000000003s)]
*  freaking everything. Yeah. Remember supply chain and all that stuff people talk about. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3012.48s)]
*  And so everything shot up real estate shot up because people sat around in their houses [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3016.72s)]
*  during the pandemic. And then, you know, when the sun came out and the curve was flattened and all, [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3022.08s)]
*  whatever, you know, and we're all back out. Well, these people all wanted new houses. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3028.08s)]
*  I mean, they came out of their house like a Baptist after a casserole. They were going for it. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3032.56s)]
*  They were getting it, you know? So, uh, and house prices, you know, 20, 21. Wow. That was an [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3036.88s)]
*  artificial thing though, that was created by the market being dormant and people being trapped. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3042.96s)]
*  And then this idea of looking around their house, going, my house sucks. I need a new house. Boom, [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3048.72s)]
*  they hit the market hard and it's still not recovered from that. It's still got the ripple [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3052.72s)]
*  of that. And some of the other things are hit that way too. Um, and, and, but there's some things, [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3056.96s)]
*  again, the policy issues, but most of it is just the smoothing out of that. And Trump nor Biden [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3061.84s)]
*  should get the credit nor the blame. It was more of how the marketplace was functioning. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3068.4s)]
*  So you think that inflation will come down? Is that the right term to talk about inflation? [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3071.84s)]
*  Yeah, I do. I don't think it's permanent. Um, again, it, to the extent that the politicians [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3076.6400000000003s)]
*  leave their hands off of stuff, but the, um, both parties, but the, um, as the marketplace [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3082.32s)]
*  will smooth out again, demand prices go up. Number of people want to pay that. No. So now [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3089.2s)]
*  demand goes down, which brings prices down, you know? So the thing smooths out eventually, [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3096.3199999999997s)]
*  you find this equilibrium, this balance. And the problem is the price that the shortage drove the [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3101.04s)]
*  prices up and the shortage remained. And then people's appetite, they just kept coming, man, [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3105.6s)]
*  like freaking piranha. And that the marketplace surges is what drove the pricing as much as anything. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3110.3199999999997s)]
*  Now, that's not true in oil and gas at the pump. That's a whole different subject. That's not true [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3116.48s)]
*  on a few other things, but housing for sure. You know, bread, uh, grocery store cart. Yeah, [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3121.12s)]
*  all that for sure. You always hear about like the national debt, right? People talk about that all [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3127.92s)]
*  the time. And it just keeps going up. Apparently. Like, is that a real thing that affects it almost [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3135.28s)]
*  seems so fictional now that it's like, is it a real thing that could cause something to happen [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3142.24s)]
*  in like in our lives or like, is it like, what is it? You know what I'm saying? Cause everybody's [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3149.2s)]
*  like, you know, it's just zillions. They're making up amounts of money now. Yeah. It's a whole [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3154.7999999999997s)]
*  kid told me yesterday it was 65 zillion. And I'm like, that's how much it is. I mean, right now [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3159.2799999999997s)]
*  it's 34. It's a number that I don't even know. How can you teach kids numbers in school, but you [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3169.04s)]
*  can't even teach them a number that would let them explain the national debt? Yeah. Uh, you know, [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3174.88s)]
*  I went through a period of time in my twenties when I was first starting to do this stuff, [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3182.0s)]
*  late twenties, that, uh, that I was worried that the hockey stick of this thing, the, the, the, [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3186.4s)]
*  the growth of the debt is, was going to cripple the economy and even cause a complete collapse. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3193.68s)]
*  Um, and you know, I, so I've observed people in my world write books on the end of the world. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3199.9199999999996s)]
*  You know, here's the economic end of the world coming, the economic end of the world. Here's the [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3207.3599999999997s)]
*  and, and they keep being wrong. So I don't want to write that book. So, uh, is it concerning? [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3212.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's concerning because anytime a group of people, us keep spending more than we make, [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3220.48s)]
*  and we keep electing people that don't have any ability to curb their appetite for our money, [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3226.96s)]
*  uh, it's, uh, man that, that philosophically, spiritually is scary. Mathematically is scary. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3233.84s)]
*  Is it going to cause a crash? Apparently not. Yeah. Cause it, I mean, I've been doing this a long, [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3242.56s)]
*  I've been watching this thinking when, you know, when, you know, but it's not. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3249.36s)]
*  And obviously what the national debt is, what it does do factually is it robs money from the economy [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3253.52s)]
*  that could be producing something. And so, because what happens is, is the government issues a bond. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3262.32s)]
*  That's how they finance the debts, treasury bonds, T bills and T bonds. And so they issue that bond [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3268.8s)]
*  and then an investor goes and buys that government bond because they're going to pay him interest on [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3275.28s)]
*  it. If that investor had done something else in the marketplace with that money to produce [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3280.5600000000004s)]
*  something rather than sit on this bunch of fat in DC, it would have churned, it would have ginned [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3286.5600000000004s)]
*  up the economy. I see. So, uh, it's stealing money from the economy in that sense. Um, and it's [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3292.7200000000003s)]
*  becoming a large, the interest only on it is becoming a larger and larger portion of the [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3300.08s)]
*  quote budget unquote, as if they've got a budget. Um, yeah, I have, I put money into kind of T bills. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3304.72s)]
*  I'm kind of a say, uh, it was you. Um, cause I, there's a lot of me, I don't trust the stock [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3312.88s)]
*  market that much. I feel like it's so manipulated these days. I feel like there's like darker [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3322.08s)]
*  forces that are like, you can use the media to control it and like, can like create articles [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3326.88s)]
*  to affect how the market goes. So that's kind of like, so I prefer something like a T bill or [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3332.4s)]
*  something like that. That's just like a safe, I know what it's going to be pretty much. Um, [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3338.2400000000002s)]
*  well, there's always been falsehood and manipulation in the market. There's always been to a degree. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3342.4s)]
*  Do you think it's still a safe place for people to invest? I do. I've got, I've got millions and [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3351.12s)]
*  millions of dollars in mutual funds. So the way to offset that is number one, if you don't, I [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3354.88s)]
*  believe it's there. I believe it's a very small percentage and I don't know where it is exactly. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3362.7200000000003s)]
*  I can't point and say that guy, that one, you know, that girl, that thing right there. I don't [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3368.32s)]
*  know exactly where it is, but I mean, is there people that fluff the thing? Absolutely. They [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3371.84s)]
*  fluff it. Absolutely. Is there people that, you know, that, uh, right before the news article [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3376.88s)]
*  goes out, they sell their stuff inside of trading. It happens all the time. Sometimes they get caught, [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3381.68s)]
*  go to jail. It's illegal, but does it happen? Oh, it's common practice. Is it so widespread [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3386.08s)]
*  that it makes the investment, uh, improper or imprudent? No, I don't believe that. Otherwise, [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3392.48s)]
*  I wouldn't be investing. Um, uh, so, uh, so I invest. So if I'm in a mutual fund, I'm in 90 to 200 [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3398.7999999999997s)]
*  different stocks and it's stuff that you drive by every day. It's McDonald's or Home Depot or [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3406.88s)]
*  Dell computer or Apple or Exxon or whatever, right? That's in the night. All that. And so, uh, in [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3413.6800000000003s)]
*  those 90 to 200, is there some percentage of that problem going on? Yeah, there is some percentage, [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3424.4s)]
*  but not enough that it, in general, those 90 to 200 companies, I'm, I'm spread out wide enough, [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3430.32s)]
*  diversified, I'm spread out enough that I'm catching all the good and it's more than offsetting [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3436.48s)]
*  the falsehood that's out there. And it's more than offsetting that. So as Home Depot makes more money [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3443.44s)]
*  than I'm participating as whoever Apple makes more money than I'm participating because I'm [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3450.48s)]
*  one of the owners of the company, tiny, tiny little bit when I own, you know, in that 90 to 200 [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3456.48s)]
*  stocks. So that's how I don't buy single stocks mainly because they're higher risk and much more [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3461.52s)]
*  volatile. And you're much more prey to what if that was the company that was screwing around? [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3466.8s)]
*  Yeah. Then boom, you know, you bet the whole dad gum farm on that one horse race and that guy [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3472.0s)]
*  fell out. No, we're not doing that. So I don't like that much risk. So I like the diversification [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3477.84s)]
*  of mutual funds. That's where my, all my retirement is. Uh, it's what we recommend, what we teach. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3482.4s)]
*  So I only do two kinds of investing. I buy real estate that I pay cash for and I buy mutual funds. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3487.6800000000003s)]

*  on it than you will in mutual funds. Mutual funds average 10, 12%. Real estate you ought to make [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3680.64s)]
*  17 to 20, including the tax benefits, the appreciation that's going up in value and the [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3686.48s)]
*  cash flow. Those three things do it. The problem with real estate is it's a pain in the butt [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3690.64s)]
*  because you've got to deal with it. You know, the roof leaks, whether it's commercial office building, [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3697.2s)]
*  whether it's a house, doesn't matter. And so, and I've got a lot of both and, but there's, [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3703.12s)]
*  you know, there's a tenant that doesn't pay or does pay or it's empty and I can't get a tenant. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3709.12s)]
*  You know, there's a hassle factor to dealing with. Even if you hired management, I mean, [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3713.7599999999998s)]
*  my son-in-law runs all the Ramsey real estate stuff and he and I grew up in real estate, [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3720.24s)]
*  so I love working with him on it, but he handles the day to day to day. I don't screw with all that [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3724.0s)]
*  today, but it's a pain. So this idea that I hear this stuff on social media stuff, what's real [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3729.12s)]
*  estate's passive income. Bull crap. Nothing passive about it. Your butt's active. I mean, [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3734.7999999999997s)]
*  you're right in the middle of it or you're getting it screwed one of the two. Yeah, you get it. Oh, [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3740.64s)]
*  yeah. I got into some real estate and it was, it was a night. It was so much extra work that [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3744.8s)]
*  I didn't realize, you know, complaints, somebody's Airbnb in the building, somebody's, you know, [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3750.0800000000004s)]
*  started a fire or something, you know, because they didn't want to use the heat in their unit [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3757.6000000000004s)]
*  or whatever. It's like, you can't just do a fire. Like you got to need a fireplace. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3762.0s)]

*  Well, I mean, the T bill, you know, what you're talking about, that's you don't buy it and you [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3781.76s)]
*  forget it and they send you a check. It's not as big a check, but there's no hassle. Yeah. You know, [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3785.76s)]
*  mutual funds, a little more risk because you're in there with all these companies, there could be [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3790.8s)]
*  something going on. Even if you're in 90 to 200 and limited the risk by spreading it out, [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3794.4s)]
*  you still got more risks than you would in the T bill, but you're going to make a little more. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3799.36s)]
*  You want a little more hassle, go to the real estate. You're going to make a little more. So [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3803.04s)]
*  you don't want to be, you know, I try to just say it's a risk return ratio. If I'm going to take [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3806.32s)]
*  some risk and have some hassle, I want some extra money for that. Yeah. Yeah. Cause it's the stress [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3812.96s)]
*  it causes. Like, do I want to be, cause I'll notice, yeah, like some stocks is too much stress for me [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3818.7200000000003s)]
*  because I'll check them too much and I don't like it. And then it's like, I spent, you know, [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3823.36s)]
*  30 minutes of my day dang checking stocks and that's the time I could have just had him doing [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3827.36s)]
*  my work. Yeah. I buy a mutual fund, set it and forget it. I don't even know what the market has [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3831.6s)]
*  done this year. Wow. And I do this for a living. Wow. I don't keep up with it. I don't, because [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3836.1600000000003s)]
*  I'm not betting on this week. I'm saying, okay, you know, look at what the stock market has done [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3840.8s)]
*  since 1980, since 1990, since 2012. Look at what I would have made if I'd have put $10,000, [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3848.0s)]
*  what it would have made. And that's how I'm playing it is the long haul, the long play. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3854.88s)]
*  Wow. God. Well, there it is. 1992 thousand dollars would have turned into [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3859.52s)]
*  $5,000. Was there ever a stock that you bought Dave where you were like, man, I wish I would have [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3866.56s)]
*  held onto that. That you just remember like even when you were younger, was it one? I never bought [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3871.2000000000003s)]
*  single stocks ever. The only dumb thing I did is I bought gold one time. This buddy of mine, again, [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3875.04s)]
*  you know, these buddies in my twenties, he was making money and he had this guy, gold guy that [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3881.7599999999998s)]
*  we could buy options on gold, which we don't even buy in the gold, just buying the right to buy the [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3886.48s)]
*  gold. And he said he put in 5,000 bucks and if it goes up, the option goes from 5k to 50k, [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3891.92s)]
*  10x my money. And 14 times in a row, this guy had hit. Why don't you put it in? And I'm like, [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3899.12s)]
*  he had predicted and he said, okay, we need to go in right now and put 5,000 up, drop 5,000 bucks in [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3907.3599999999997s)]
*  there. 15th time he didn't hit. You'd see that it's all or nothing. So I lost the whole 5,000 and no [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3911.6s)]
*  sign of 50. Right? So I'm done. You think it was a pyramid scheme or not? No, no, it's an option. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3918.3999999999996s)]
*  It's how options work. It's just, you're, it's an Uber high risk situation. It's super crazy. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3923.92s)]
*  It was just gambling. I mean, it's just gambling. You ever been in a pyramid scheme? No, I've been [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3928.64s)]
*  in a couple. Are you talking about multi-level or pyramid? I mean, I don't know what it was. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3934.8s)]
*  Whatever level it was, I lost on it. I know that you didn't get off the ride fast enough. Oh yeah. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3942.48s)]
*  No, we had, yeah. Oh yeah. One, I was a child. I got involved. I'd saved up a, I mean, probably [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3947.92s)]
*  most of the money I had and I got into this thing and it was a scam and that was horrible. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3953.44s)]
*  God, that killed me. And then another time they had a dude, somebody was selling like glitter mining [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3960.0s)]
*  or something in our area and they sold a bunch of shares of that shit and screwed everybody. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3965.92s)]
*  I remember in the eighties, everybody decided that emus were going to be the new meat. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3971.68s)]
*  And so all these, all these rednecks are, this is unbelievable. All these, all these rednecks are [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3977.92s)]

*  So they were, it's, it was a big deal and a lot of people decided they were going to sell everything [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3990.48s)]
*  and open an emu farm. Really? And cause for the meat, it's like ostrich meat. It's like, [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=3995.28s)]
*  I don't know, it's a big bird meat, big white meat. So bring up a picture of an emu brother. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4001.2000000000003s)]
*  You can't find a dang emu. You can't find one now, I guess. Here you go. You got the commercial. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4006.0s)]
*  Scroll down a little bit. Let me see what we got. He's got a little meat on him. Oh gosh. Yeah. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4011.2s)]
*  Yeah. I, yeah. So it's hilarious though. These rednecks and around Tennessee, [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4016.32s)]
*  they were having emu farms. Have you ever had any of it? No, I managed to stay out of that scam. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4020.7999999999997s)]
*  That was a, one of those fad things that didn't work. So yeah, that's a damn, it's like buying [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4025.84s)]
*  beanie babies. Everybody's collecting beanie babies. I remember being, they were going to get rich on [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4031.52s)]
*  beanie babies. Oh yeah. And now they have two garbage bags. Women, women fighting like, like [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4035.44s)]

*  collection, not because it was an investment, but because my wife was freaking obsessed and I was [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4056.56s)]
*  traveling and she's at every airport. She's in there. So yeah, see $49,000 on eBay for the [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4060.64s)]

*  every year. He won us like $600, dude. He was so excited. He could have changed his life. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4079.68s)]
*  And instead his mom convinced him to buy a Christmas village of like rare Christmas [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4085.7599999999998s)]
*  village houses. Oh yeah. They're back. They're back. They're coming. They're happening right now. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4092.4s)]
*  My buddy to this day is, uh, he's big in the Christmas houses, no rent, rent in much. The tenants [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4098.88s)]
*  don't make much noise. And the, uh, and the street lights are always on. Electric bill's low. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4104.8s)]
*  Oh, yeah. So yeah, running into a lot of issues, but God, that just broke him, man. He never [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4111.84s)]
*  recovered from that. Dude, I met a dude yesterday in Tennessee. He said he took out a $800 life [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4118.4800000000005s)]
*  insurance policy on his wife. I'm like, $800. That's pretty insulting. Well, yeah, that's what I felt like. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4125.2s)]
*  I'm like, dude, do not tell her that. He's going to be pissed off. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4134.56s)]
*  This is like, he's like, well, my truck payment's 799 a month. So, [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4138.32s)]
*  yeah, speaking of like, yeah, like kind of traps, I guess, like what are like, so a lot of things [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4146.0s)]
*  you've spoken out against crypto. I know I'm not a crypto fan. I lost $2,000 in crypto. Just like [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4151.52s)]
*  every one of my friends did when it first came out, right? Um, like NFTs, things like that, [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4156.16s)]
*  that kind of pop up that really they're almost, to me, some of them seem like the modern day [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4161.92s)]
*  pyramid scheme in a way. The emu farm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's a lot of emu farms, baby. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4167.12s)]
*  What do you, how do you, why are more people falling susceptible to these types of things? [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4173.04s)]
*  Do you think? We always have, uh, that's human nature. Uh, we want, we're, we're wired by God to [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4178.08s)]
*  look for the, uh, shortest path to, to look for optimum, to look for the best, the quickest, [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4186.08s)]
*  the easiest. And there's nothing wrong with that. That makes our lives better because we create [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4192.48s)]
*  inventions and things that make our lives better. That's that, that very wiring created the [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4196.5599999999995s)]
*  automobile or created the, the iPhone or created, you know, things that make our lives better. And [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4200.5599999999995s)]
*  so that's a good wiring, but where it gets off track is, um, where we think we can short circuit [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4204.879999999999s)]
*  a proven process and it causes you to jump from investor to speculator and investors always the [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4211.919999999999s)]
*  crockpot. They're always the long play. They're always saying, okay, I'm going to invest in mutual [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4219.28s)]
*  funds. I don't care what stock market did this year. I'm thinking, what's it going to be in 20 [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4223.92s)]
*  years? What's it going to be in 15 years? And how am I going to be doing, you know? And so I'm [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4228.32s)]
*  thinking long-term, the speculator needs a quick flip. And so Bitcoin was, is never really been [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4232.72s)]
*  about investing. It's a speculation. It's a short-term play. No one bought that and said, [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4241.04s)]
*  you know, in 20 years, this is going to look brilliant. No one did. They all thought the quick [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4246.56s)]
*  money, easy money, no one flips houses with nothing down that they saw on tick tock, you know, [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4250.88s)]
*  quick flip, quick flip. When you, when a builder even builds a home that does that, they're not [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4258.08s)]
*  custom building. They call it a spec house. It means speculation. They're speculating that [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4263.4400000000005s)]
*  they're going to sell that house. It's a short-term play. They're not building that house in that [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4269.52s)]
*  subdivision, hoping to sit on it 10 years. They're building, hoping to sit on 10 days. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4274.08s)]
*  And so it's speculation. So where you get confused, where you mess up is where you can fall [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4279.84s)]
*  into scams and get rich quick and violate basic investing principles is when you move from [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4284.96s)]
*  investing, which is long-term mentality, to speculation, which is quick hit. I want quick [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4291.599999999999s)]
*  money, easy money, quick money, easy money. And that's that wiring that's positive wiring gone [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4296.0s)]
*  astray, you know, become toxic. And so, and in a sense, that's what happened to me when I went [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4300.96s)]
*  broke in real estate because I was buying houses. I was doing flip this house before Chip and Joanna [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4307.2s)]
*  were born, you know? And so that's what we were, we were getting it. And I've owned like 2000 houses [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4311.2s)]
*  in my life. So I was, I was churning them, man, but I was doing it on 90 day notes, short-term notes [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4316.48s)]
*  because I was not buying them as a long-term play. I was buying them, fix them and flip them. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4321.84s)]
*  And the bank got sold to another bank. They look up and they can call my notes in 90 days. So they [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4325.92s)]
*  called a million two in 90 days and it crashed me. And so, cause I was a speculator. I wasn't an [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4330.5599999999995s)]
*  investor. Now I would have told you I was a real estate investor, but the actual definition of the [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4335.36s)]
*  term investor means longer term horizon, long window. And so if it's thank God it's Friday, [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4340.639999999999s)]
*  Oh God, it's Monday. If I got to move it this calendar year or in the next two calendar years [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4347.599999999999s)]
*  to make money on it, then you know, you're playing the roulette wheel. You're playing Texas Hold'em. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4351.599999999999s)]
*  You're that's speculation. You're gambling then. And that's a different thing. It's okay if you [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4355.44s)]
*  want to do some of that, but quit calling it investing because then it causes you to put two [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4360.08s)]
*  dad got much money in it. Cause you lose your butt then. And that's where you get scammed [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4364.72s)]
*  is you're looking for something for nothing quick, a quick turn, double my money fast. Cause I don't [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4368.72s)]
*  think I can get there longterm. So I'm so desperate and so scared, so fearful, so greedy that I got to [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4374.400000000001s)]
*  get it right now. And that's what I was doing and it worked. I got a million dollars worth of stuff, [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4380.96s)]
*  but I didn't keep it cause I built a house of cards. Obviously when you work, sometimes it's [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4385.04s)]
*  weird. Like people ask me like, what hobbies do I have and stuff? But the weird thing is like, [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4389.68s)]
*  a lot of my hobbies became my jobs. You know, did that, is that kind of what happened for you? [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4394.88s)]
*  Or do you still like have things that you'd like to do outside of, [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4402.08s)]
*  you know, as I got further down in the business in the last several decades, I actually do have [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4406.08s)]
*  things I do outside of here. But in the first few decades, it was just, you're right. I get great [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4411.280000000001s)]
*  joy out of the stuff we do. Yeah. We help people. You know, a lot of people are scared. They're [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4417.6s)]

*  our gig's a different gig, but it's still, you know, it's fun to be with people. Yeah. And it's [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4435.92s)]
*  fun to be with people that want to be there, you know, and it's addicting in that regard. So I [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4440.08s)]
*  enjoy that whole thing. I enjoy that scene. I enjoy running the business, but also have picked [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4445.2s)]
*  up a few things away from here so that I distractions and I don't know if they're hobbies, [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4449.68s)]
*  I guess, but I end up collecting stuff or whatever, doing that kind of stuff. And yeah, [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4454.56s)]
*  but there's nothing wrong with, especially in the first couple of decades with almost all your [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4459.84s)]
*  energy doing that other than family stuff. Yeah. What are some, like, obviously you've learned a [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4464.4800000000005s)]
*  lot of financial lessons over the years. Like what were some personal lessons that you had to learn [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4470.320000000001s)]
*  along the way too, that like kind of helped you? Like, was there some things that have kind of [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4474.0s)]
*  stood out to you, you feel like? You know, I, yeah, I didn't know how to lead. I mean, like you said [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4477.76s)]
*  earlier, we're talking about hiring an employee. Yeah. I just, I was so dumb that I thought if you [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4488.72s)]
*  hired people that they would like work. Yeah. They knew what to do. Well, no, that they would [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4494.72s)]
*  just actually work. I thought, I thought they would just show up. I thought they'd be on time. I [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4499.68s)]
*  didn't think they'd steal. I was so dumb that I thought all that. And so I just like, if you could [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4503.2s)]
*  fog up a mirror, yeah, let's go do this together, man. Come on, get in here. I'll put you on payroll. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4508.16s)]
*  Let's go. And then I got all this crazy and all this drama and all this other stuff. I was horrible. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4512.08s)]
*  And I was, I was pretty much a boss, bosses, uh, push leaders pull. And man, when I was 32 years old, [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4517.28s)]
*  I didn't get that. And we hired our first person when I was 32. And so, you know, over the years, [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4525.679999999999s)]
*  I've had to learn to not be behind. Cause I mean, if you're a boss, you're just at the back of the [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4532.0s)]
*  cattle and cracking the whip. And it's like, you're moving at the speed of the slowest cow, [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4536.56s)]
*  you know, like the slowest common denominator in the room. You know, it's like you get on. If you're [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4542.88s)]
*  the leader, you're standing at the train going, uh, we're leaving. Anybody want to get on? [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4548.72s)]
*  Cause this thing's going. Right. You better keep up cause we're going hard and you better get it. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4554.16s)]
*  And so I had to get around front of that and say, all right, I'm going to lead. And then I [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4560.16s)]
*  went to this Christian conference with a guy named John Maxwell, who's become a great friend. He's [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4565.44s)]
*  one of the top leadership speakers in the world. And he, um, he said, you know, you, [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4569.04s)]
*  you should be a servant leader. And I went, say what? I'm one right in the check. I ain't the [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4574.64s)]
*  servant. I'm confused here. And I, I thought he meant subservient. And what he meant was you got [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4580.5599999999995s)]
*  to love your people and you got to care what's best for them. And sometimes that means telling [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4588.96s)]
*  them hard truth that they don't want to hear. Sometimes it means they can't work anymore [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4593.6s)]
*  because they can't behave, you know, uh, that kind of stuff. And so I realized I had been serving my [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4598.32s)]
*  kids by making them brush their teeth against their will, you know, so they have some teeth later. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4604.72s)]
*  That's serving them. So it's a servant leader, right? And so, yeah, I'm good with servant [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4609.36s)]
*  leadership. And so I had to learn that. I, I can, I sucked. I was a horrible boss because I just, [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4614.08s)]
*  I was going so hard. I thought everybody else was going hard and I was pissed off because they [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4619.5199999999995s)]
*  weren't keeping up. And I'm like, well, you hired a bunch of donkeys and expect to win the dead gum, [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4622.5599999999995s)]
*  Kentucky Derby and no donkey ever won man. So we had to look for thoroughbreds and have a [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4627.12s)]
*  donkeyectomy and it was a problem there. And so, yeah, I was, I sucked and, and I'm, I, I mean, [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4632.16s)]
*  I'm a world-class leader today. It's one of the things I'm best at. I love our people. I love [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4639.68s)]
*  our team. The way this place functions and operates, it's one of the best places in Nashville [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4643.12s)]
*  to work, probably the best places in the world to work. And it's not perfect. We screw up, but, [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4647.5199999999995s)]
*  but we treat people right. We care about them and we expect high things out of them. We expect them [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4652.32s)]
*  to get it. And, and they do. We've got a great team. Wow. Yeah. I think that's something that [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4656.5599999999995s)]
*  I did have slowly like had to, yeah, that's been an, that's been a tough journey for me. Like even [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4662.32s)]
*  just having a few employees and it's like, you're suddenly a, yeah, you're suddenly a boss. You [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4667.92s)]
*  didn't want to be a ball. Like some of that too, I think just a realization like, oh, I'm the boss, [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4674.4s)]
*  I guess, you know? And I'm like, well, yeah, you are. And I'm like, well, I was just trying, [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4679.4400000000005s)]
*  I was just trying to get crap done, you know? Who knew? You know? And I needed somebody to do that [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4684.08s)]
*  thing and you brought you and do that thing. And then you brought all your crap with you when you [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4688.4800000000005s)]
*  did that. Now I got to deal with your crap. So, you know, and that, that's been, that's been a [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4692.24s)]
*  30 year journey. And so- That's huge. Boss versus leader. That's so, it's really, it's such a good [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4696.88s)]
*  way to look at it. And would you go to conferences and stuff to learn about that stuff too? Cause I'm [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4702.639999999999s)]
*  sure you had to evolve in that space. I did. I read like a maniac and so I'm going to read, [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4708.0s)]
*  you know, leadership books, business books. I still read like crazy. I love to get new information [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4712.32s)]
*  in this digital age and old guy like me, I got, I get, I get, I'm sitting in these meetings with [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4717.76s)]
*  these studs and I don't even know what they're saying. And they work for me. What did you just [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4722.320000000001s)]
*  say? So I have to keep up. I mean, I gotta, I gotta work hard. I gotta pedal hard just to stay on the [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4727.76s)]
*  bike. And so, um, yeah, I still do that stuff and I still, you know, hang out. And the good news is [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4732.08s)]
*  some of the guys that are the best writers and thinkers in the world have become friends over [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4737.92s)]
*  the years. And so they're my running buddies. So we hang out and I get to talk offline with them and [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4741.68s)]
*  they still teaching me stuff. It's cool. What about like fiction? You read anything like that [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4746.32s)]
*  ever? Oh yeah, always. Yeah. All the Jack Carr stuff. You were a Jack. Yeah. Yeah. I read all [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4750.32s)]
*  that stuff and Brad Thor's a friend. I read all of his stuff, all those spy novels and stuff. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4755.04s)]
*  Fiction makes airplanes fly, fly fast. Yeah. It does. Huh? Yeah. Jack Carr. That's wild, dude. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4760.799999999999s)]
*  Um, yeah, I was like a big John Grisham fan when I was growing up. Yeah. I read all of his, [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4767.84s)]
*  every one of his. And Daniel Silva is the guy, the guy he writes like, uh, the, uh, the character [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4771.52s)]
*  that prognost is, um, an Israeli Mossad, uh, spy, you know, versus Jack Carr's is a former SEAL team [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4778.96s)]
*  and, you know, and Brad Thor's is all the same stuff. You know, they're, they're all former Delta, [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4789.200000000001s)]
*  former SEAL or whatever, that kind of stuff. So it's in the same genre and I've read all of his [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4793.68s)]
*  stuff too. But again, I just, that, so yeah, I do read fiction. Yes. Something you like. Yeah. Um, [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4797.76s)]
*  when people look at like, um, there's an election this year, it's an election year. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4803.76s)]
*  When people look at the election, do you feel like who they vote for could have an effect on [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4809.04s)]
*  their future finances? Sure. Sure. Um, not as much as the candidates would like you to believe. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4815.4400000000005s)]
*  Right. Um, it turns out that I've done stupid stuff under every single White House and I have [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4823.68s)]
*  done smart stuff under every single White House and I've increased our size of our business under [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4830.400000000001s)]
*  every single White House. None of them have been dumb enough to destroy my life and, um, none of [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4834.56s)]
*  them have ever sent me any money. Yeah. So most of them don't even send me my money back. So, um, [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4839.84s)]
*  so, you know, what happens at your house is way more important than what happens at the White House. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4845.6s)]
*  But yeah, policy does matter. It changes whether we've got $3 gas or $5 gas, you know, um, you know, [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4850.08s)]
*  uh, and, and that matters because if you run a heating air company and you got 30 trucks out [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4857.04s)]
*  there and you're trying to feed your family and trying to feed that guy who's on that truck's [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4861.2s)]
*  family and the gas price doubles on that, run that truck down the road to fix somebody's heating air, [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4864.08s)]
*  it changes the whole P and L on that company. And then that guy wants a raise and it ain't there [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4868.88s)]
*  because some doober at the White House turned the faucet on or off on the oil and that stuff matters. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4873.04s)]
*  That shows up. And so, um, you know, policy does matter in that regard because it affects things [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4877.84s)]
*  and policy during, uh, stressful times matters because it caught where the people feel. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4884.16s)]
*  Ronald Reagan didn't do anything special, but he made people feel like it was going to be prosperous. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4890.72s)]
*  Well, you agree with him or not. He was a, he was a motivator. He was aspirational. And so, [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4894.72s)]
*  it's a good point. He didn't really have any magic wands that he waved at the Reaganomics [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4900.88s)]
*  and make sure, you know, raise, uh, an Art Laffer that wrote the Reaganomic stuff lives here in town. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4906.72s)]
*  He's a friend of mine. He was on Reagan's cabinet at the time. He's in his eighties. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4911.12s)]
*  Wonderful man. Brilliant man. But Art Laffer did not turn America around Ronald Reagan, [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4915.12s)]
*  but Ronald Reagan made people believe again. And when you can believe instead of believe [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4919.280000000001s)]
*  everything's bad, it's horrible, it's divisive, we're not going to do anything about it, [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4924.0s)]
*  people sit at home and they don't do things. And then the economy starts to, that, [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4927.360000000001s)]
*  that stuff does have an effect, but you can win in any situation. So, uh, vote for, [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4930.8s)]
*  vote for who you want to vote for. Um, but don't vote for them because they're going to fix your [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4935.84s)]
*  life because they're not. That's a great statement. Yeah. Um, in the end, it really comes down to you. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4939.6s)]
*  Doesn't it? You still believe that it really seems like that. Yeah, I really do. Um, you know, [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4946.24s)]
*  John Stossel wanted to interview me many years ago and back when he did 2020 and all that stuff, and [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4951.12s)]
*  he was a scary dude. Cause you know, if he's going to come, come into your throat or whether he's [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4956.08s)]
*  going to be a friend in an interview and we went down there and we were sitting off stage, our own [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4959.28s)]
*  stage, I guess, doing the interview and he said, you know, I've read all your stuff and I'm, and [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4964.64s)]
*  he goes, I think, uh, I don't think you're as much of a conservative as you think you are. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4968.08s)]
*  He said, I think you're a, uh, a social conservative and an economic libertarian. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4974.240000000001s)]
*  Okay. I'll go with that. And so, yeah, the economic libertarian would say, you know, uh, if it's to be, [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4980.88s)]
*  it's up to me, get up, go mow some grass, get you a pressure washer, get your button gear. And, [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4988.160000000001s)]
*  you know, the government's just something you got to overcome. They're in the way. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4994.08s)]
*  They're not going to lift me. If I'm waiting on the government to lift me, all I can think about [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=4997.92s)]
*  is the DMV line. I mean, come on, you know, so I'm not, so I'm that guy. Um, but it comes out of my [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5002.32s)]

*  When they're winning, especially. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5046.96s)]
*  Yeah, it helps. The past two years has been definitely a good time to get on board. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5050.32s)]
*  Not good being with 110,000 people when you're losing because they are angry rednecks, but yeah. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5053.36s)]

*  Do you go to some games ever? [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5060.32s)]
*  We had, uh, suites for a sweet seats for years when our kids were down there. And so we'd go down [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5061.76s)]
*  almost every game and, but the kids are grown and got grandkids and we're traveling, [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5068.48s)]
*  doing other stuff. So we gave those up, but so I'm not, I'm not mad about it. It just kind of that [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5072.8s)]
*  phase went away. Yeah. I'm watching on the TV now, but better, better experience anyway. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5076.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5081.76s)]

*  Yeah. Yeah. In marketing class. Oh, in class. You saw her. Huh? [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5087.28s)]
*  Yeah. She was cheating off my paper. Was she really, [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5090.4s)]
*  but she was cute. So I thought it was a good idea. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5094.08s)]
*  Let her look over. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5096.0s)]
*  It's your paper. It's your paper, honey. Um, have you ever been approached by, uh, like, [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5098.88s)]
*  I know you've had different, um, obviously books and, and, um, like programs for people to achieve [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5106.08s)]
*  wealth and to save their money. Do have you ever like had a package or something that you've taken [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5114.16s)]
*  to like a shark tank or to like a, um, a something like that where they've tried to [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5119.44s)]
*  know, uh, because we kind of bootstrapped every bit of this. It was just like, [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5125.5199999999995s)]
*  we make a little money. We try something new with that money. We make a little more money. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5128.96s)]
*  We try something new with that money. And again, we've lost a lot of money, done a lot of stupid [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5131.84s)]
*  stuff doing that, but we've also done some things right that have worked. And so, um, I mean, [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5135.6s)]
*  we're the second largest talk radio show in America, 680 stations, about 10 million listeners [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5141.04s)]
*  on talk radio alone. Uh, Hannity's number one rush was number one. Hannity was two. We were three. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5146.56s)]
*  Rush passed away. Not a good way to get to be number two, but it happened. I mean, he's Elvis. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5152.400000000001s)]
*  He invented rock and roll invented, invented talk radio. So it was, it was, uh, [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5157.120000000001s)]
*  and both of them did pills too. I think, but that's, I have no idea about it, but I'm just saying, [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5161.92s)]
*  yeah, no idea. But yeah, anyway, so anyway, we started in that world when it grew and grew [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5167.4400000000005s)]
*  and grew and grew. And I remember the day a guy walked in my office and said, Hey, we need a [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5172.08s)]
*  podcast. And I'm like, what the flip is a podcast? And he goes, so why do I need one? He goes, it's [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5176.16s)]
*  the thing. And man, it was a long time ago. So we were one of the first podcasts on Apple way back. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5181.68s)]
*  And, uh, cause a lot of people on talk radio didn't want to put it on podcast because it [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5189.04s)]
*  competed with the radio stations. Right. So you're competing with your own numbers. Yeah. And you're [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5193.28s)]
*  messing it, messing up everything. And you know, now I mean, Spotify, Apple, we're number one, two, [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5197.2s)]
*  three on Apple right in there, hovering me and Rogan and some NPR, uh, murder mystery stuff or [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5202.4s)]
*  something, you know, always hanging out in the top 10 there. So we're bouncing around in there [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5208.88s)]
*  and we've had a billion and a half downloads now. And so, and I'm like, what's a podcast? So yeah, [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5213.4400000000005s)]
*  you start, you know, you start new stuff and then YouTube, good God, the numbers on YouTube are just [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5219.28s)]
*  great. And so gone up into the right hockey stick. And so now those two have now eclipsed, [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5224.16s)]
*  um, the talk radio business. And so now I'm a podcaster apparently. Um, [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5230.64s)]
*  at least you evolved with it though, you know? Well, yeah, I mean, cause we're platform agnostic. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5235.28s)]
*  I mean, wherever, wherever the action is, that's where we're going to be. And we didn't [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5239.76s)]
*  abandon when we didn't, we're still dancing with the girl that brought us, you know, so we're still [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5243.04s)]
*  with talk radio, still got 680 stations, still love talk radio. Uh, but, and you know, we're on [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5247.280000000001s)]
*  serious XM, serious XM came on, it was two companies, serious and XM. We went on both of them and [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5252.24s)]
*  everybody's mad. You can't be on both and be on talk radio. I'm like, yeah, I'm on everything. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5256.400000000001s)]
*  I'm on podcasts and then we put on YouTube and then, then, you know, Facebook live. I mean, crap, [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5260.8s)]
*  we'll try anything. Tick tock or good God help us. We're on tick tock. We're all on. So, you know, [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5265.84s)]
*  it's like the Chinese, they say I'm, that's it, man. Tick tack. Here we go. So, but the, um, [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5270.72s)]
*  but hey, you know, and cause you never know which one of these things is going to become the next [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5276.24s)]
*  my space and just disappear. And you don't know which one of these other things. So I don't want [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5279.52s)]
*  to bet this whole thing and all these 1100 people are counting on me on one single platform. So [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5285.04s)]
*  we're always innovating, always changing and moving. Um, yeah, it's because yeah, you kind of don't [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5291.360000000001s)]
*  know what the, yeah, you don't know what the next thing can be. That's really going to go well. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5297.6s)]
*  There was something you said a second ago where like you made some money and then you put it back [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5301.280000000001s)]
*  into the company, right? Or you tried something new with it. That I think is a big, like one of [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5306.72s)]
*  the craziest things that ever happened to me was I was podcasting in my apartment and a guy came [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5312.4800000000005s)]
*  along and he said, Hey man, I'm going to give you some money. You can get you a studio, you know? [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5319.44s)]
*  And he, oh, he bought some ads from me. He said, I'm gonna pay some ads for a pizza place. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5326.32s)]
*  It was in my neighborhood. And, uh, and he said, I'm gonna give you some money. You should use it [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5330.32s)]
*  to get a studio. And my first thought was, I want to keep that money. You know, I never had any money. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5335.839999999999s)]
*  I'm keeping this money. I'm not getting a studio. I'll just, I'll just do it in my, in my apartment [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5341.5199999999995s)]
*  till it fades out and then I'll have the money I made from the ads. But he was right. He just saw [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5345.6s)]
*  that thing that I couldn't see of putting the money back into getting myself a studio, which then now [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5351.360000000001s)]
*  I have a studio. It's a little bit of a different place. When people come, it's more of a business. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5356.56s)]
*  And now, you know, it was so hard for me to see that though, you know? And we get to see, I mean, [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5360.56s)]
*  those of us that are fanboys of your work, we'd see a whole nother side of you, you know, their [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5366.4800000000005s)]
*  standup and then these long form interviews that you're doing. And here I said, who knew that was [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5371.76s)]
*  gonna happen? But I mean, I've seen a bunch of these long forms that you've done. And so it's a [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5375.92s)]
*  whole different thing. And it's where people start to recognize what those of us in the business of [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5379.76s)]
*  being on stage or in front of a microphone have known. We know, for those of you out there, you [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5386.56s)]
*  don't know this necessarily, but most of the top flight comedians are very bright. You know, [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5390.8s)]
*  comedy's hard. It's more than one of the more hard art forms to do. Acting, you can be dumb as a rock [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5398.88s)]
*  and be an actor. You just try to be somebody else. That's all you're doing. It's a process. Sorry, [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5405.84s)]
*  you actors that are friends. But I mean, comedy is, you're messing with people's lives. You're [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5410.48s)]
*  messing with every part of things that mean something to them. And you're twisting it just [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5417.44s)]
*  the right way with the right hesitation, the right move of the sentence structure and everything. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5422.08s)]
*  It's very difficult. We, you know, we doing motivational speaking or teaching, I teach our [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5428.08s)]
*  guys, if our audiences, if we got 2000, 3000 people in the audience, if they don't laugh [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5432.96s)]
*  every seven minutes, we're gonna lose them. And we're not comedians, but we have to study [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5438.24s)]
*  what you guys do. So getting to see you do this has, it's brilliant. It's a smart thing to do. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5443.84s)]
*  It's the same thing. Broken did the same thing. I mean, he moved from, you know, comedy into those [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5449.52s)]
*  long forms. And what everybody loves about Joe is the fabulous interviews. And I'm a fanboy of [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5454.24s)]
*  his. I watch a lot of his stuff. Oh yeah. He's so good at learning information. He's so good at [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5460.32s)]
*  retaining information. He knows a lot about a lot of stuff. Oh, if you stop, I had dinner with him [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5463.92s)]
*  the other night after the UFC fights and yeah, you're just ready to learn, brother. You better, [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5468.719999999999s)]
*  if you're gonna sit down with Joe Rogan, you better be ready to learn something. It doesn't matter [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5472.639999999999s)]
*  if it's over a bowl of soup, a microphone. Yeah. He just loves learning, sharing information. He [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5476.32s)]
*  really is kind of like a library, you know? But what is the mentality that people, it's more [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5481.92s)]
*  about like the mentality of like investing back in yourself, you know? Cause there's that fear [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5488.4800000000005s)]
*  that I want to just save this, you know? Well, that, yeah, if you realize that no [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5494.88s)]
*  matter what you try, some of it's not gonna work, give yourself permission to fail. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5501.6s)]
*  Then you say, okay, we're gonna put this money in, we're gonna take some home and enjoy it and [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5505.92s)]
*  be generous with it in the community and invest some of it. But we're also gonna [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5510.64s)]
*  invest some of it in the best investment, which is, you know, the freaking goose that's laying the [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5514.56s)]
*  golden eggs. Let's, you know, let's have lots of these geese. Let's get, figure out different [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5520.0s)]
*  things we can do, different ways we can move this business around. Do we move to podcasting? Do we [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5523.6s)]
*  move to YouTube? Do we build a studio? Do we build an event center? Do we, to create an environment [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5529.04s)]
*  that is a whole different thing than when I rent a theater somewhere else, which we do both. And [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5534.88s)]
*  we'll always go to these other cities and always be on tour, always do these things. But the events [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5540.8s)]
*  on this campus feel way different to the customer when they come in here, because we can control [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5545.68s)]
*  all the freaking variables. I mean, we're Nick Saban playing home game. I mean, we know who cuts [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5550.64s)]
*  the grass. We know who dialed the microphone in. I got a two DB drop from the front of the stage to [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5555.52s)]
*  the back of that auditorium. Wow. 2500 seats. It's tight and it's dialed in. And you don't, [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5560.8s)]
*  you know how that sound crap is. Sounds even worse in our world because we're voice music. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5566.8s)]
*  You can just turn it up if the sound's bad, you know, but man, you get in these auditoriums, [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5571.12s)]
*  you got bounce back, stinking hockey arena, the stinking hitting the concrete wall coming back at [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5574.96s)]
*  you. You can hear yourself three times and can't even tell what your timing is on stuff. Yeah, [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5580.24s)]
*  that's the worst. So we've got all that dialed in. That's, that's a reinvestment back into [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5584.4800000000005s)]
*  something we know is going to work. Yeah. Yeah, that's a good point, man. Yeah, I think that was [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5588.72s)]
*  the tough thing. It was tough for me to like realize that one of my greatest assets can be myself, [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5592.88s)]
*  you know, and be like, well, if I really want to invest in something to invest in myself, [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5598.16s)]
*  how does generosity play? Like there's a lot of fear around generosity sometimes, you know, [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5604.8s)]
*  about like, I have to made this, I have to keep it all for me. What do you, what has your journey [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5609.52s)]
*  been like with that in life or what have you learned about it? You're exactly right. There is [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5614.72s)]
*  fear around that. And fear is the motivator is, is if I give it away, I'm gonna have less, [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5618.96s)]
*  which mathematically, you know, if I take a thousand bucks, I give away a hundred, [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5624.56s)]
*  I got 900. So yeah, I've got less, but that's a short term mentality. And what I finally figured [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5628.240000000001s)]
*  out after studying this all these years and watching people who are generous, there's a real [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5635.6s)]
*  correlation between people that build wealth and people that are generous. Very few wealthy [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5639.76s)]
*  people are really super greedy and don't give. Most of them are very big givers. They're big [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5644.5599999999995s)]
*  tippers. They're not like tight. They're not like mean about money. They're very open-handed [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5649.04s)]
*  because they know they can get some more. So what happens is generosity is not an action. It's a [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5654.24s)]
*  character quality like integrity. Integrity is not an action. There are actions that come out when [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5659.28s)]
*  you have integrity. There are actions that come out when you are generous. Generous people are the [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5664.08s)]
*  one who hold the door open for you. Generous people help you pick up the groceries when the stupid [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5668.719999999999s)]
*  bag, they fall out and they're rolling all over the parking lot and the grocery store, [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5672.08s)]
*  and you're embarrassed. But the generous person runs over and joins the party and helps you pick [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5674.8s)]
*  up the canned goods and all that. That's the generous person. The generous person is other [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5679.28s)]
*  centered instead of self-centered. And here's what's weird. Think about who you want to work with. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5685.04s)]
*  Think about who you want to work for. Think about who you want on your team. Think about the vendor [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5692.5599999999995s)]
*  that you want to do business with. The next deal you want to do on an advertiser. You want to deal [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5696.96s)]
*  with a selfish person or a selfless other-centered person? Self-centered or other-centered? Well, [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5701.68s)]
*  generosity makes people highly attractive. We want to be around generous people. Not because [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5708.320000000001s)]
*  they're going to give us money, just because of who they are. They're just open-handed. They're [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5713.92s)]
*  thinking about other people. And so there's this huge correlation between generosity and prosperity. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5718.56s)]
*  You tend to prosper because people want you around. They want you in the deal because you're not [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5724.88s)]
*  there for what you can get. You're there for what you can give. And we're all going to win [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5730.24s)]
*  together. We don't have to kill each other to win. And so that's how Rush or Sean and I in the old [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5734.719999999999s)]
*  days or other people in the talk radio business, Laura Ingram was doing a talk radio show in those [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5740.48s)]
*  days. She's on Fox Personality now. We're all friends, even though we were competitors. We were [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5745.5199999999995s)]
*  head-to-head. If I knock Hannity off a station, I get that station. So we're head-to-head. But we [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5750.719999999999s)]
*  also know I don't have to kill him to win. I never talk bad about my competitors in that world [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5756.0s)]
*  because I want to be a generous person. I'll help them. I've actually helped every one of those [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5765.28s)]
*  people do different things over the time. And so it's just interesting. And then the giving of [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5769.92s)]
*  money is a natural result for someone who has the character quality of generosity. And I watch [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5777.36s)]
*  people, okay, here's the stupid thing. This guy I was watching the other day, he pulled up in front [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5784.72s)]
*  of me at the restaurant, the valet parking right here in Nashville. We have valet parkers everywhere. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5788.88s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, churches even have them. Yeah. I mean, who's working valet? Okay. The Lord is my valet, [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5794.64s)]
*  dude. I'm telling you, man. Well, there's that. But the guy that's working valet, he's out there in [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5801.280000000001s)]
*  the sun. He's out there in the rain. He's putting up with people's garbage. They're not nice. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5808.64s)]
*  You know, this is who's working the valet. And this guy pulls up in a Mercedes and I know the [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5816.08s)]
*  car. It's a great car. It's about $120,000, $130,000 car. And he hands the valet $5. Dude, [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5820.08s)]
*  that's just stupid. So I pull up my truck, you know, it's a nice truck, but I pull up my truck, [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5829.04s)]
*  I hand the guy $20. I'm like, please take care of my baby. You know where it was when I came out? [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5836.08s)]
*  I was sitting right there. Yeah. You know, so who prospered here? Everybody won. Everybody won. But [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5842.24s)]
*  you didn't give Ferris Bueller's day off the keys to your Mercedes for five bucks. I mean, [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5848.48s)]
*  what kind of moron? I mean, seriously, that's just short sighted. That lack of generosity is [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5853.04s)]
*  short sighted where it sounds like I'm some kind of big guy because I gave $20 or whatever to park [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5858.08s)]
*  my stupid truck, but I'm not. But there's a payoff there. My truck didn't, there's another [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5863.6s)]
*  on my truck. It's sitting right there. I don't have to wait on it when I come out. The kid had [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5869.04s)]
*  a good night, at least partly because of me. So I think everybody came out on this transaction. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5872.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. That's how generosity works. Yeah. That's interesting. It's been slow to learn for me, [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5878.320000000001s)]
*  not slow, but I think it's just been, yeah, I just came from such a fear mentality. You know, [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5883.280000000001s)]
*  we didn't have any money. So it was like, I remember I keep my money in a day. I'd hide it. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5890.8s)]
*  God, I would hide that money. I would spend half my day hiding my damn money, boy. I met this guy. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5895.2s)]
*  Digging up dirt and hiding it. Oh, I understand. I met this guy, an Orthodox Jewish Rabbi, [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5900.0s)]
*  and we've become good friends. Rabbi Daniel Lappan, he wrote a book. Oh, he's hiding some. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5905.28s)]
*  He wrote a book. No, no. He wrote a book called Thou Shall Prosper. And he said, the problem is, [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5908.72s)]
*  when you have that fear is you think money is like cake. Like if I get a slice away, I got less cake. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5913.92s)]
*  Money's not like cake. Money's like candles. When you light it, you still got your candle. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5920.16s)]
*  When you light another one, you still got your candle. When you light another one, [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5925.360000000001s)]
*  you still got your candle. That's how money works. Money will grow around you when you're [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5928.08s)]
*  doing the right stuff that you're supposed to be doing. And I thought it was a beautiful picture. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5932.64s)]
*  What role has faith played in your life? You mentioned it a little bit. How's that, [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5939.52s)]
*  what's that been like for you? It's central. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5942.72s)]
*  I know you said other-centered earlier, which I thought was a term you hear a lot of times. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5945.84s)]
*  Yeah, I guess that's maybe a faith phrase. I don't know. But honestly, it's taught me how to be a [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5953.4400000000005s)]
*  better human being because I really wasn't a good one. I grew up, the crap we did, man, and the way [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5962.32s)]
*  I behaved in my early years of my life. Were you just a dang anarchist or whatever? [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5970.24s)]
*  Apparently. I did all kinds of just redneck stupid stuff. But I needed to be a better person. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5974.719999999999s)]
*  And it turns out, again, better people have better lives. So the whole character shift [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5984.48s)]
*  through the faith walk of meeting Jesus and changing that, it cleaned up my view of things. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5990.0s)]
*  It cleaned up my actions and how I react and those kinds of things. Because, I mean, again, [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=5999.76s)]
*  I grew up where it was a Scotch-Irish thing. It's like a temper thing going on. So you can't do that [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=6007.280000000001s)]
*  and win out there. You can't be a jerk everywhere. And so you got to go in, you know, they don't want [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=6015.2s)]
*  you back on the show if you're a butt in the green room. Yeah. And so it turns out that all [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=6019.84s)]
*  worked out for me. So the re-transformation, be not conformed to this world, but be transformed [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=6025.76s)]
*  by the renewing of your mind, Romans says in the Bible. And so the renewing of my mind over 45 [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=6033.76s)]
*  years. And I'm not a wry, don't misunderstand, but like I said earlier, I'm a lot better husband [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=6040.16s)]
*  than I was. I mean, even with my grandbabies, I'm playing my grandbabies, my kids are like, [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=6045.76s)]
*  who are you? I can hand this one back. This one smells bad. It's broken. You can take that one [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=6050.24s)]
*  home. But yeah, who are you? Papa Dave. I mean, come on, man. You wouldn't let us get by with that [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=6057.04s)]
*  crap. I'm like, yeah, I know. But I had to make you behave, but whatever. You can take this one [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=6062.16s)]
*  home. You can teach it. But yeah, it's central to everything. I know who I am. I know where I'm [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=6065.68s)]
*  going. It affects how I deal with kids, marriage affects my money, affects how I lead in the [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=6071.76s)]
*  business, affects our decisions in the marketplace. So yeah, it's, I guess it's central to everything. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=6079.76s)]
*  If you want to look at it that way, it's changed my life. Yeah. Really? Yeah, absolutely. Completely. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=6085.280000000001s)]
*  Wow. That's amazing, man. It's nice to hear. Did you, when you look at your future now, like what [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=6092.72s)]
*  are things that you still want to do? You've had so much success and such the opportunity to [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=6100.08s)]
*  lead people to make financial choices. You helped my stepdad paid off our house because of knowledge [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=6104.64s)]
*  he learned from you. Wow. I remember that. And so it took him a little bit, but I remember one day [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=6110.32s)]
*  he told me he'd heard it. And then probably 11 years later, eight years later, something he said, [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=6117.44s)]
*  house is paid off. Yeah. It's pretty cool. I love it. What are things that still excite you? [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=6122.96s)]
*  You know, things that move the needle and I get to see something move with a little bit of scale [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=6128.4800000000005s)]
*  out there where we can affect some one's life. And then I run into them. I went in and you know, [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=6133.76s)]
*  this YouTube thing with a billion and a half downloads on that thing. Now it's a whole new [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=6141.84s)]
*  market that talk radio was old white guys, right? Yeah. Right. But YouTube's youngsters. And so [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=6147.280000000001s)]
*  Sharon and I were in Best Buy and these two kids are like 17 years old run up. Like I'm some kind [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=6154.48s)]
*  of freaking rock star or something like me. I love your YouTube stuff. It's like, man, I just paid [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=6160.5599999999995s)]

*  You can't change everything about them, but what are some things you remind them of? [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=6241.12s)]
*  Yeah. Dr. John Delaney, this one of our Ramsey personalities on our team has done a lot of trauma [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=6244.16s)]
*  studies. He's got a PhD in counseling and he says when you're in the middle of trauma, like he's [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=6249.84s)]
*  done been on police calls when they go in and there's a, you know, murder or a suicide or [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=6255.04s)]
*  something in the home, extreme trauma. And your body physically reacts to trauma. And he says the [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=6260.96s)]
*  way to walk through those things is facts are your friends. Your feelings are not true. And so [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=6270.0s)]
*  when you feel stuck and hopeless, you got to back out and start looking about, okay, here's what's [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=6278.16s)]
*  really, here's the numbers and here's the reality of the marketplace. Facts are your friends. And [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=6284.72s)]
*  so oftentimes when someone calls on the Ramsey show, that's all we're doing. They call up and [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=6292.48s)]
*  they're overwhelmed. They're frozen. They're paralyzed. They don't know what to do. And we're [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=6297.68s)]
*  going, now, wait a minute, how much you make a year? We'll make a hundred thousand. Okay. And so, [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=6301.4400000000005s)]
*  and we just, we're stuck. We can't move. We can't, we can't figure out what to do. I'm like, okay, [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=6305.360000000001s)]
*  how much you own your car? 56,000. Okay. All right. And how much, you know, do you have in retirement? [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=6308.64s)]
*  Nothing. Okay. How old are you? I'm 26. Okay. All right. And, you know, and okay. Now, so the facts [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=6313.68s)]
*  are that you really have plenty of money coming in and you bought a car you can't afford. Sells stupid [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=6320.400000000001s)]
*  car. Yeah. He goes, Oh man, you're like a genius, like sixth grade man. It's like, so, but all we did [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=6327.2s)]
*  was peel back the drama that are all of us, our bodies just freeze up. We just get in freak [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=6337.36s)]
*  hopelessness. Yeah. Freeze is a response to trauma and freezing up. We're stuck and we don't know what to do. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=6343.679999999999s)]
*  And, and all we do is cut the dad gum trees down so you can see the forest, you know, and can't see [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=6349.04s)]

*  to actually figure out how to stop the foreclosure. But, you know, the reality was her whole life was [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=6394.32s)]
*  coming to an end on Friday and it's a house. There's one on every corner. Let's go get another one. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnUP1kJqD4&t=6400.4s)]
