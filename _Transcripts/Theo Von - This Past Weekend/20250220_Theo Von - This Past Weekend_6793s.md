*  Green. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=95.28s)]
*  Tom Green, it's your first day back in LA in four years. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, feels good. Actually, it's [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=110.27999999999999s)]
*  yeah, it was weird. I just moved four years ago. It's kind of [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=116.8s)]
*  somewhat spontaneous decision, you know, when COVID happened, remember that? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=122.0s)]
*  And everything stopped and all of a sudden, you know, I've been touring and I'll just remember [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=125.83999999999999s)]
*  everybody stopped touring, right? At the beginning. Yeah, everything kind of just stopped. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=132.79999999999998s)]
*  I was trying to remember if it was just me that stopped or did everyone stop? Everyone stopped. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=136.32s)]
*  So about the first six months or so of that, I was kind of [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=142.2s)]
*  what I'm gonna do and then I just kind of realized I [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=147.68s)]
*  well, I got this, I was telling you about my van. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=151.2s)]
*  I got this van and I started going out into the desert and making [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=153.0s)]
*  videos and stuff. Here outside of LA? Just outside LA. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=156.84s)]
*  And I loved being out in the desert so much and just waking up in the morning [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=160.07999999999998s)]
*  with a cup of coffee and just looking at the sun coming up over the mountains and just the peacefulness of that. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=164.32000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, it's out in the Mojave Desert. That was like the first day of the trip, I think four years ago. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=169.64000000000001s)]
*  And so then, you know, I just decided to sell my house. I'd been in my house for 18 years. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=174.12s)]
*  I sold my house and went back to Canada and bought a farm near where my parents live and [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=179.08s)]
*  just, I can't believe four years went by, but yesterday was the first day back in Los Angeles. In the van, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=185.52s)]
*  we drove back down to the van. So I've been touring with my fiance who you just met. I have a fiance now. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=190.88s)]
*  I went back to Canada. I've got a fiance from Canada now. Yeah, good choice. And we came back in the van and [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=195.96s)]
*  and just drove into town yesterday and [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=202.35999999999999s)]
*  it's pretty weird because it's like it feels like I, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=206.07999999999998s)]
*  nothing's really, it kind of makes you think about time. Time is weird, you know, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=209.32s)]
*  because I went away for four years and then you come back and I drove past my house that I lived in for almost 20 years. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=213.24s)]
*  And now I'm staying in a hotel right down across from where the house is. I can actually see the house from the hotel room. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=220.92s)]
*  I sort of did that on purpose because I thought it would be weird. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=226.28s)]
*  You know, I'm going to, I went to Art's Deli, you know, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=232.28s)]
*  I lived sort of in the Studio City area here and I went to Art's Deli and got my same pastrami sandwich and my [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=234.79999999999998s)]
*  my chicken noodle soup and [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=241.24s)]
*  and I've been going to some of the same restaurants, just been here for a day and it doesn't feel like it's been four years. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=243.72s)]
*  It feels like I actually, I'm driving here, you know, and today I was sort of almost [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=249.8s)]
*  forgot that I didn't live here anymore. I kept thinking, oh, I'll go back to my house after, oh right, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=255.68s)]
*  I don't live here anymore. So that's a strange thing. But on the flip side, in the last four years, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=259.64s)]
*  I've got a farm, which I've now really settled into. I've got these incredible animals, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=265.24s)]
*  which are now, I'm really bonded with this mule and this donkey and [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=271.52s)]
*  two horses and [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=276.52s)]
*  chickens and it's just like this, it's sort of been an incredible, incredible journey the last four years. So yeah, it's been cool. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=278.56s)]
*  Was it something that you always wanted to have? You feel like a farm? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=286.15999999999997s)]
*  I guess every human kind of maybe feels something like that. I'm gonna get a little bit of land, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=289.03999999999996s)]
*  I'm gonna get some animals. Was it that or was it? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=292.76s)]
*  No, it's weird because I never really imagined having a mule, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=294.79999999999995s)]
*  you know, like and riding a mule every day and grow up with that. You know, I grew up in the suburbs of [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=299.08s)]
*  Ottawa, Canada. I'm outside of Ottawa, but [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=304.91999999999996s)]
*  And a mule is kind of like the El Camino of horses in a way. Yeah, it's very much the, you know what I'm saying? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=308.2s)]
*  It's not me saying, hey, I'm gonna get a horse. It's like I'm gonna get a mule. Yeah. Yeah, I sort of thought, initially [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=314.88s)]
*  I thought it would be kind of funny and then the mule I happened to find, Fanny, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=321.36s)]
*  is her name and she's this beautiful mule. She's this huge animal and that's Kia, the donkey in the background. And so [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=326.71999999999997s)]
*  and so it's just become this sort of amazing change, but yeah, I [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=334.85999999999996s)]
*  you know, I initially I hadn't really thought of [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=341.65999999999997s)]
*  necessarily [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=345.3s)]
*  getting a farm with a mule and all the stuff, but I wanted to get a place that was kind of in nature [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=346.53999999999996s)]
*  really was and then the the the farm happened to have these old barns on it and I thought it'd be kind of cool to [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=351.34s)]
*  get a mule in those barns. So I now am [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=356.5s)]
*  very much [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=360.9s)]
*  loving life up there. I get up in the morning and I have saddle her up and ride off into the wilderness. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=363.14s)]
*  It's pretty cool. Really? So does it fit and that's never something that you wanted that was never like a thing of your whole life [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=367.52s)]
*  like I want to have this thing. It just kind of yeah. I mean, I always loved animals [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=372.73999999999995s)]
*  and I you know, I have my dog Charlie and I've always enjoyed being outdoors, but I [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=376.53999999999996s)]
*  mean it just [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=382.38s)]
*  it just kind of [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=385.02s)]
*  I know every once in a while, you know, you know [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=388.41999999999996s)]
*  sometimes when an idea pops into your head and then you just go with it and then all of a sudden you've done it. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=390.1s)]
*  This is like that except I sort of occurred to me afterwards, you know as I was doing it [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=394.42s)]
*  realizing, you know, I'm gonna have this mule for the rest of my life, you know, like they live to be [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=399.3s)]
*  donkeys live to be up to 40, 50 years old. Oh my god, really? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=402.94s)]
*  He is only three so so it's a lifelong commitment and [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=406.22s)]
*  the donkey could live after you. Absolutely. She probably will but yeah, so it's so but it's you know, it's it's I [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=410.42s)]
*  think maybe I was looking for something that would kind of ground me and you know, give me that home base that I needed, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=418.65999999999997s)]
*  you know, this is the first this is the first time I've ever lived somewhere where I know I'm gonna be there for the rest [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=424.02s)]
*  of my life. I'm planting trees [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=428.65999999999997s)]
*  and I'm thinking in 20 years, I'm gonna that tree is gonna be and these trees are gonna be bigger and I'm kind of [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=431.21999999999997s)]
*  sort of plotting out things that way and yeah, that's interesting. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=435.78s)]
*  I can totally relate with that and what you're saying about LA. LA just feels like this kind of it's almost like LA doesn't have [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=439.05999999999995s)]
*  a memory in it. It feels like [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=445.46s)]
*  I don't know other places I think especially if it's a place that's a little more grounded it feels [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=448.02s)]
*  maybe more meaningful for some reason. I don't know. Yeah, it's I mean [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=452.17999999999995s)]
*  it's weird. I moved here when I was 28. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=457.73999999999995s)]
*  I think it was 28 or 29 when I moved to LA. I'm 53 now and [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=461.7s)]
*  I mean I loved it. I had a great time here. I wasn't wasn't leaving LA because I didn't you know, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=467.17999999999995s)]
*  like LA or anything. It was just it was more I wanted to be close to my parents and [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=473.42s)]
*  they're still doing good and I wanted to be close to family and stuff and but [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=477.26s)]
*  but yeah, it's [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=482.58s)]
*  it is a it is a unique place for sure. People come here from all over the world [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=484.62s)]
*  pursue their dreams and and [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=489.86s)]
*  there's sort of a energy there that's exciting, but you know when you [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=492.18s)]
*  as I got a little older, you know, I left when I was 50 and [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=497.58s)]
*  you know [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=502.94s)]
*  not married, no kids, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=504.66s)]
*  COVID happened. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=507.06s)]
*  I wake up. I've been in my house for 18 years. The real estate market went up. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=509.06s)]
*  I was like, oh, maybe I should sell it now as opposed to you know, five years ago. I wouldn't want to. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=513.78s)]
*  So there was a moment in time. Maybe I'll sell this place, you know, that I've been [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=518.86s)]
*  living in for 20 years waiting for the right moment to feel like it was time to go and [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=523.18s)]
*  and [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=528.1400000000001s)]
*  because I don't know I kind of felt like I wanted to be [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=529.3800000000001s)]
*  back where I grew up, you know, I mean you're not you're not from here either. So, you know, it's there's something there's something [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=533.6600000000001s)]
*  there's something very [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=540.1400000000001s)]
*  sort of I [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=542.0200000000001s)]
*  guess deep that you feel when you're home, you know, I know I'm sure what no where you're from [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=543.6600000000001s)]
*  Louisiana. I live in Louisiana. But yeah, it gives you yeah, there's a sense of like [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=549.1800000000001s)]
*  Yeah that you've been out of your soil for a long time, you know that you've kind of like when you go back to Louisiana [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=554.5s)]

*  think it makes sense that a [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=567.66s)]
*  part of you wants to kind of go back where you came into the world at or be there, you know, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=569.66s)]
*  to be see people that care about me. Yeah, see that see people that I care about. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=574.18s)]
*  Wonder if you've gotten enough of the like the [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=578.7s)]
*  adventure out of your system in some ways you can still have the adventure but just have it from there, you know. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=581.66s)]
*  Yeah, and I think also the part like you're saying about this is the first time you'd ever like planted plants. You're like, I'll see these [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=586.9399999999999s)]
*  I've always felt like my life was very [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=592.9s)]
*  transient like I was just passing by. I've never been the type of guy to get like a lot of furniture or artwork or anything. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=596.38s)]
*  I'm always just like I don't know how long I'm gonna be here and it's always and here [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=602.6999999999999s)]
*  I am in my 40s and it's still I still kind of operate like that. But [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=606.68s)]
*  at a certain point it's like yeah, you want something that's a little bit more settling. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=610.9s)]
*  And if you found a fiance, I'm sure that kind of helped a little bit. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, Amanda's here. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=614.14s)]
*  It's her first time in Los Angeles. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=619.22s)]
*  At least you get to be a host and a tour guide. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=621.22s)]

*  so like cuz when I got this van I [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=632.98s)]
*  kind of got pretty good at it like going to [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=636.2199999999999s)]
*  really remote places in the American Southwest particularly like in New Mexico, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=639.18s)]
*  Utah. Zion? You go to Zion? Yeah, I went to Zion. I did camp in Zion, but like there's there's this other kind of land [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=644.9799999999999s)]
*  called BLM land. It's Bureau of Land Management land that is [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=652.14s)]
*  basically all of the [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=657.42s)]
*  desert and land that is owned by the US government. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=659.6999999999999s)]
*  It's managed by the Bureau of Land Management and they'll cut roads into the desert and they'll put sort of [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=662.34s)]
*  campsite areas with fire pits and stuff. They kind of keep it somewhat [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=668.9399999999999s)]
*  organized so that people don't go driving all around the desert and trash in the desert. They have these roads and stuff. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=673.78s)]
*  So you can get I got this app. It's called [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=678.72s)]
*  Dirt, D-Y-R-T. It's like it's basically an app that gives you all the [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=682.14s)]
*  different locations of these sort of really obscure [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=686.66s)]
*  places that are not even in national parks or anything. D-U-I-R-T? Yeah. Yeah, and so it kind of like you find stuff that is just [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=689.86s)]
*  unbelievable like [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=698.38s)]
*  you know, I sort of can't stop talking about it to people that don't know about it, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=700.3s)]
*  but like I mean you may know about Chaco Canyon, but I'd never heard of it before. It was it's this it's in New Mexico and [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=703.9s)]
*  in fact if you go to my last [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=709.9399999999999s)]
*  YouTube video on my YouTube channel, that's just a video I shot a couple of days ago. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=712.14s)]
*  And you can scroll down to like the second video, the second video. This is Chaco Canyon. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=717.9399999999999s)]
*  So this is like Native American ruins that are [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=723.6999999999999s)]
*  essentially like built in the year [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=728.54s)]
*  875. It's like you know, and it's like this it's a city, you know, it's like a city in the desert. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=731.66s)]
*  And it's just out there in the middle of northern New Mexico. This is Amanda, my fiancee Amanda. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=737.18s)]
*  And [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=743.5799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=745.18s)]
*  And we're just going around making these videos and but you'll see like look at this place. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=746.8599999999999s)]
*  So it's like, you know, everyone always talks about Machu Picchu in Peru and they talk about all these incredible things in [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=751.2199999999999s)]
*  you know ancient, you know, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=757.18s)]
*  you know places, but like the fact that you can just drive out of Albuquerque, you know drive north of Albuquerque. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=759.9399999999999s)]
*  You know, wow, this is there. Yeah, this is there and it's really remote like it's on the Navajo Nation [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=766.26s)]
*  land. And so we just were out there camping for four nights and [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=773.26s)]
*  exploring and hiking off into this beautiful desert and [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=778.8599999999999s)]
*  Getting some good rest out there. You get good rest when you're out on the road. Oh, yeah. Absolutely. Yeah. That's nice. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=782.9s)]
*  It's nice just it's quiet. That's the tough thing to get man. Cooking on the campfire and and it's just been fun. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=787.42s)]
*  And I enjoy photography, you know, you're shooting this really really well. Yeah, I got sort of lots of [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=794.26s)]
*  different cameras and stuff and I like to kind of [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=801.22s)]
*  do that. So it's there's something about shooting out in the desert. That's just so beautiful because you have these long [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=804.98s)]
*  horizons and you know big open spaces. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=810.82s)]
*  But and there's an energy there that is just something that's hard to put your finger on but it just you know, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=813.42s)]
*  I always kind of sort of I never really kind of [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=818.78s)]
*  really maybe didn't even believe in that when I was younger when people would talk about the energy and [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=822.9s)]
*  Sedona's got this energy. Yeah, but you know, I feel this energy out there. That's just of the people that live there that built that place. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=828.22s)]
*  It's it's it's and and other places like it. So it's kind of fun to go seek those places out, you know. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=834.74s)]
*  Yeah, you'll meet a lot of women. You're like, I never have a period when I'm in Sedona or whatever and you're like, well, that's [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=839.7s)]
*  Who do we talk? You know I'm saying like but there's some crazy. You've met a lot of women that have said that I mean [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=845.34s)]
*  I just think you meet a lot of women. Yeah, who are you know specific thing for a lot of people to have said but yeah [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=849.74s)]
*  A lot of women are keeping crystals in the wrong places probably, you know [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=856.2199999999999s)]
*  But yeah, you meet a lot of wow of people who are into that sort of thing [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=860.0999999999999s)]
*  But I think that's probably like I mean the natives it always feels to me like the natives were probably so in touch more in [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=862.9399999999999s)]
*  touch with the earth and locked in on like [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=868.4s)]
*  The feeling of like the best places to be that's why they love to be in and like the Dakota's and in the Black Hills and stuff [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=870.42s)]
*  Like that and so to be able to go to one of those ruins. I bet I bet there's still a lot of like [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=876.12s)]
*  Just a lot of prehistoric or like native connection that's just looking for souls to pass through you know [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=881.5s)]
*  Yeah, what you just said is like really interesting because I was talking to a [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=886.9399999999999s)]
*  basically an archaeologist the other day and he said exactly what you just said like [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=891.3399999999999s)]
*  there's this thing called a [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=895.3399999999999s)]
*  intuitive archaeology where they go [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=897.3399999999999s)]
*  Because there's still stuff out in the desert that people haven't even found yet [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=900.62s)]
*  like it's just how big it is and how vast it is and he so they go out into these canyons and [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=904.3s)]
*  Northern Arizona and Utah looking for [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=910.0600000000001s)]
*  signs of you know ancient settlements and stuff and you know they're sort of taught to [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=914.22s)]
*  Intuitive archaeology if you're in a place that feels like it would be a nice place to have lived [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=919.98s)]
*  You know a beautiful place. Yeah, just a good chance. You're that feeling is correct [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=926.0600000000001s)]
*  And then you should sort of listen to that instinct and start looking for signs of ancient civilization [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=931.9s)]
*  but it's pretty [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=937.9s)]
*  Amazing because [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=940.54s)]

*  the energy of [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=966.38s)]
*  You see a lot of comics that have passed away on the wall and you say oh my god [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=967.98s)]
*  Sam kinnison performed here, you know, I can sort of [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=971.5s)]

*  Years ago or whatever, but now you take it back to the year 875 [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=984.38s)]
*  You're out in the desert and this this place choco-coco [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=987.9s)]
*  Society is like where they did trading and people came from all over north america there and so it's uh, it's a very peaceful thing [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=990.7s)]

*  You're a young guy, too [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1085.26s)]
*  You know, there was a lot of things that happened that you know, I don't know if you want to talk about [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1086.1399999999999s)]
*  You know, i'm talking a lot about energy but coincidences and synchronicity and things like this. I moved back to canada [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1091.18s)]
*  uh, and I have a pond on my [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1098.22s)]
*  Property and in the winter it freezes over and I shoveled the snow off the pond [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1101.48s)]
*  and I was playing hockey on the pond like [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1107.66s)]
*  skating playing hockey on the pond [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1111.16s)]
*  shot a video of that [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1113.3400000000001s)]
*  And uh put it up on uh, the social medias, there we go. Wow, that's beautiful [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1116.46s)]
*  Here we are out of the out of the pond [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1121.66s)]
*  Wow, you got a fast guy on the draw out there on the uh, I just literally just said that and he instantly found [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1123.3400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, we're so we're drilling a hole in the pond here and and that's then we can pump the water out of that back [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1130.7s)]
*  On top of the pond and give it a nice smooth [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1136.06s)]
*  uh [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1138.7s)]
*  Icy, that's my friend ryan. Oh wait. So what are you using here to do this? This is a it's just a little sort of a [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1140.14s)]
*  Kind of some sort of a ice auger or some sort [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1145.5s)]
*  Okay [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1147.82s)]
*  So that so you take the hole and then you then we got a pump [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1148.06s)]
*  We just stick a fire hose down in there and we pump water out of it [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1150.78s)]
*  We pump it up on top of the of the of the ice [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1153.26s)]
*  And just basically flood the ice and then it freezes because at night and then we get nice some nice smooth ice out there [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1156.54s)]
*  How long does that process take? Uh, just a day, you know, this just took a day the next morning was completely [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1162.54s)]
*  Completely frozen, but then you get two feet of snow and then you got to do it all over again [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1167.6599999999999s)]
*  But uh, which uh kind of puts a damper on it. Wow, this is so cool [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1172.06s)]
*  So that right there that you're on is a lake. It's a pond. It's a pond. Yeah, okay [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1175.58s)]
*  So that's a pond. There's the dock. So usually it's water. Yeah. Yeah, it's right now [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1179.74s)]
*  You cut the holes you're pumping the water out of the yeah pond. Yeah onto the top of the ice [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1183.26s)]
*  Which is on the top of the pond. Yeah, and then it gets it's cold, you know, it's below zero [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1188.94s)]
*  so then the next morning it was pretty much ready to [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1192.78s)]
*  Now normally you would shovel it off first, but we just kind of [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1195.82s)]
*  We're kind of a little lazy about that [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1199.26s)]
*  I guess and we just flooded it instead which it ended up working out fine [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1201.34s)]
*  But uh probably would have been better if we shoveled it off first, but that seems like that would have been a lot of work [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1205.26s)]
*  Yeah, you don't do that. Yeah, but um [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1209.9s)]
*  There you go see and then uh [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1212.38s)]
*  So yeah, so we were doing this and then I was I was shooting these videos playing hockey. There we go [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1214.94s)]
*  This is the next day. Yeah, it's like probably [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1219.9s)]
*  So this is a common practice in canada. Uh, well, you know if you have a pond [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1222.94s)]
*  I I mean that that those are the those are the barns in the background. That's the help my house up there behind there and [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1226.7800000000002s)]
*  so [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1232.8600000000001s)]
*  You know, I we used to do it in my backyard when I was a kid like we used to flood the backyard and uh, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1234.14s)]
*  Yeah, gretzky talked about that right when he was on his backyard. That's cool. Yeah, that's amazing the great one [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1239.26s)]
*  Yeah, so I saw him at the inauguration. He lost a tooth. Okay, it fell out the inauguration. He lost a tooth [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1245.74s)]
*  Yeah, I chipped my tooth and I walked up to him. I was like man. I chipped my tooth and he's like [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1251.5s)]
*  Oh, yeah, and he showed me this and he freaking lost one. His wife were looking for it on the ground [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1254.86s)]
*  Oh, okay, but it had been knocked out previously in a hockey game of some sort something [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1259.1s)]
*  I think you didn't get punched out at the inauguration. No, I think he could have been shocked by something [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1263.58s)]
*  You saw maybe maybe that took it out. But yeah, he was just missing a grill piece at the inauguration [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1267.66s)]
*  It's just pretty bizarre man. That's cool, dude. That's amazing [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1273.02s)]
*  So these are the types of things you're spending time doing up there [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1276.38s)]
*  You really document it really beautifully and a lot of that doesn't even have a lot of audio with it [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1278.3000000000002s)]

*  And go film stuff that you know, maybe I could [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1691.1999999999998s)]

*  You know in some electronic way floating around there forever and sort of feels in a little way like kind of like sort of a [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1760.8799999999999s)]

*  I think that's kind of what fascinates me about these these ruins in the desert too [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1770.24s)]
*  Like these people came and built these things in the year 875 and i'm walking through it and looking at it and filming it [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1773.6799999999998s)]
*  And talking about it with you and so they're kind of in a way kind of remembered, you know [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1778.7199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, um [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1782.8s)]
*  And then there was also just kind of the blatant [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1784.1599999999999s)]
*  you know [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1787.2s)]

*  I think i've calmed down quite a bit like when I was younger. I really always needed to be kind of like [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1793.6s)]
*  You know the center of attention the class clown moving around a lot was was weird as a kid [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1799.28s)]
*  so [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1805.12s)]
*  to me it seemed like a really good way of just kind of uh, [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1806.24s)]
*  You know documenting all of this [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1809.9199999999998s)]
*  silliness, you know and uh [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1812.38s)]
*  And uh, I loved it, you know, I love filming stuff and showing it to people at school [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1815.1200000000001s)]
*  and it was so much you were one of the first people really to just [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1819.6000000000001s)]
*  Capture shit and just show it to people kind of you know, like kind of like [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1823.1200000000001s)]
*  Not shit, but I mean just yeah, you know shit for sure. Yeah, actually actual shit was involved quite a bit. Yeah [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1827.76s)]
*  Yeah, we're gonna capture shit and show it to you. Yeah. What do you mean? [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1833.52s)]
*  Like this is what we mean and I can totally relate to what you said about um [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1836.5600000000002s)]
*  Dude I used to when I was I guess probably [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1841.44s)]
*  Turning around 20 to probably 28. I would make postcards and I would send them to my kids [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1845.44s)]
*  They weren't even born yet. Like whenever I was traveling somewhere, I would send them [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1851.1200000000001s)]
*  I would make them out to my kids. I just wanted my kids to know that I'd been I needed there to be some [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1854.88s)]
*  Yeah record that I like cared about my children even though they weren't here yet [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1861.28s)]
*  Wow, which is kind of a crazy thing [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1865.76s)]
*  But it made me think about what you're saying like yeah, and I would scrapbook I would save things like I just wanted there to be [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1867.12s)]
*  Like some proof that I felt something in the world and that I existed right? [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1874.0s)]
*  I think I just didn't I don't know if I just didn't have a lot of that [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1878.3999999999999s)]
*  Like or I needed [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1882.8799999999999s)]
*  Of an insane amount of proof and so that's why I did it [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1884.32s)]
*  But yeah, I could just rely I could definitely relate to that to wanting to have some [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1887.52s)]
*  Uh [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1893.04s)]
*  Timeline [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1894.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. You know just in case [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1895.52s)]
*  Time ever showed up and said hey were you here? I could buy well. Yeah. Yeah. Yes here. I was you know [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1898.16s)]
*  Yeah, I could show you my homework kind of or something, you know, absolutely [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1904.16s)]
*  Yeah, I can relate to that because I talk a little bit my stand-up special about about not having kids [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1907.68s)]
*  And I I sometimes think it's kind of a bit of a message to my future children [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1913.12s)]
*  that you know [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1918.8s)]
*  Uh that i'm aware that I haven't had them yet, you know [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1920.0s)]
*  And so I totally understand what you're saying about that. It's uh [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1923.12s)]
*  Yeah, I mean it's [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1927.6s)]
*  It's a weird thing, you know because [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1929.92s)]
*  Right 20 years ago nobody had [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1932.72s)]
*  Definitely 30 years ago. Nobody had [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1936.0s)]
*  Video cameras really like they do now, but now everybody with their phones everything documented [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1938.8s)]
*  It's so normal now, but I just put this documentary up [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1943.6s)]
*  On prime which is it's called this is the tom green documentary [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1948.96s)]
*  It's sort of a play on my old theme song in my show. This is the tom green show was this was the song right? [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1951.8400000000001s)]
*  yeah, so um [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1956.5600000000002s)]
*  I uh [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1958.72s)]
*  went through like [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1960.24s)]
*  Thousands of hours of video i'm going back looking at you know, 17 year old me running around doing stuff [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1962.5600000000002s)]
*  and uh [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1969.1200000000001s)]
*  It was it was actually kind of a pretty um [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1970.48s)]
*  Um [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1972.48s)]
*  Somewhat terrifying experience actually because it was like this opportunity to kind of tell [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1975.1200000000001s)]
*  The story of everything that happened with my show and everything that happened with my experience here in la [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1981.52s)]
*  and I I wanted to kind of uh [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1987.44s)]
*  You know tell the story right [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1989.84s)]
*  and i've got [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1992.16s)]
*  So much video [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1993.84s)]
*  And coming through all of it was at times, you know [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1995.6s)]
*  uh [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=1999.52s)]
*  Somewhat kind of like I would be looking at myself like i'm looking at a completely different person and I can't even believe you know [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2000.56s)]
*  I'm finding things. I don't even remember happening [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2008.08s)]
*  And i'm looking at things that are just so completely bonkers and silly and ridiculous. I'm like, whoa [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2010.96s)]
*  Sometimes I couldn't look at the tv. I'm like, oh my what what was I doing? You know [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2017.84s)]
*  You know how you made us feel. Yeah exactly. I was doing it to myself 20 years 30 years later [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2021.84s)]
*  And uh, no, I wouldn't recommend it to anybody to to go make a documentary about yourself definitely hire somebody to do that [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2027.6s)]
*  Never watch it. But no it was it was fun because I wanted to tell the story the the right way but [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2033.84s)]
*  but um, it was also kind of very surreal but [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2040.0s)]
*  You know was it hard to be true to yourself making like, you know making your own documentary and and no one should probably make your [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2043.4399999999998s)]
*  documentary except for you because you're one of the rare cases it feels like that has [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2049.42s)]
*  So much has documented themselves so much, you know, like um, and I don't even know if it's [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2053.84s)]
*  I don't know if it seemed like an egotistical way. I don't think it ever came across like that of your footage [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2060.7200000000003s)]
*  It just came across you wanted to have [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2064.96s)]
*  Control over how of yourself you wanted to put yourself out there [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2067.92s)]
*  Um, but was it hard to make a documentary and not want to like make yourself the hero or something? [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2072.48s)]
*  Or I don't i've never made a documentary before. Yeah. Yeah, was there any of that in it or how do I make this? [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2078.2400000000002s)]
*  It's like the first scene of the documentary i'm sitting with my mother and she actually says are you really supposed to do a directed documentary about yourself? [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2083.12s)]
*  I mean can't you kind of whitewash that a little bit. Are you going to do that? Yeah, i'm going to do that [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2089.76s)]
*  but um, honestly the [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2094.2400000000002s)]
*  I wanted to be [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2097.12s)]
*  You know, I wanted to be [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2100.48s)]
*  I did not want to completely like, you know put a false story out there. So I think the hardest part was [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2102.4s)]
*  Trying to figure out how to not be too self [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2109.68s)]
*  Deprecating, you know because you know you think you know [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2112.62s)]
*  You know when you get to my age, uh, you know, you look back and you think oh my god [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2117.12s)]
*  I wish I hadn't done that or I wish I hadn't done that or shouldn't have said that or shouldn't have done that [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2120.56s)]
*  And you know, I have a lot of those things right there constantly rattling around in my head [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2124.4s)]
*  and you start to think like [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2128.3199999999997s)]
*  You know, man [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2131.2799999999997s)]
*  Maybe this is a good way for me to go and just like apologize for every thing that I perceived that i've done wrong in my life [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2131.84s)]
*  Right, and then you have to kind of take a step back and go well, wait a minute [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2138.8s)]
*  You know like that might just be in my head, you know [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2142.48s)]
*  so I spent a lot of time talking to a lot of people about [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2144.6400000000003s)]
*  you know people that I know people i'm close with about the story of [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2148.5600000000004s)]
*  really, it's the story of the of the show and uh, [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2154.0800000000004s)]
*  And takes us through the story of kind of creating the show and then building [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2158.0800000000004s)]
*  you know before the show with my music and then after the show with [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2162.5600000000004s)]
*  Building a you know, a sort of a web tv studio, right in my in here in los angeles [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2166.88s)]
*  and it's sort of a telling of that story, but then I wanted to talk, you know a bit about some of the [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2172.96s)]
*  you know personal sort of uh, you know, uh [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2178.64s)]
*  Things that I went through I mean I had cancer when I was on mtv and I talked about that [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2182.08s)]
*  I had you know, I made I made this movie freddy got fingered which was you know, not critically completely embraced [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2187.36s)]
*  So, you know, so it's like I wanted I wanted to explain myself a bit [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2196.48s)]
*  But then uh, you know at the same time there's a lot of people now that like the movie believe it or not [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2201.84s)]
*  So I didn't want to completely you know and hate the critics now. Yeah. Yeah, so it's sort of like it was a very [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2205.76s)]
*  tricky balancing act [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2212.2400000000002s)]
*  And uh, and then on on top of that [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2214.48s)]
*  There's just so much footage and so many weird little funny [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2216.08s)]
*  clips that only I know are the ones that people like or people have or haven't seen and I kind of wanted to make sense [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2219.2000000000003s)]
*  Of that all and piece it all together. I don't think anyone else would have been able to find it all, you know [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2225.28s)]
*  Yeah, so [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2229.28s)]
*  Hmm, but uh, was there a project that you kind of wanted to do over the years that you didn't really nail or you didn't [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2230.4s)]
*  That something that didn't happen or something because you've just done so much stuff. I mean, you know, it's it's it's [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2237.84s)]
*  it's it's interesting because [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2244.5600000000004s)]
*  like in fact, that's part of what the documentary is about because like when I was a [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2247.0400000000004s)]
*  Got into making the show when I was growing up [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2250.7999999999997s)]
*  All I could even imagine myself doing was I wanted to be a talk show host [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2254.7999999999997s)]
*  You know, I wanted to do basically a show like David Letterman, right have guests on and then I go out in the street and [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2260.4s)]
*  You know be a nutcase, you know do goofy stuff, right? [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2265.92s)]
*  and I got to do that, you know a few times over the years and [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2269.3599999999997s)]
*  you know [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2274.16s)]
*  When those shows go away, you know [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2275.44s)]
*  Initially when that happened, you know, that was back in the day of MTV [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2278.08s)]
*  You know the first show I stopped when I when I got sick [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2280.48s)]
*  So, you know, it didn't actually get cancelled the Tom Green show [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2283.2s)]
*  But then when I started I did a nightly show it kind of you know [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2285.92s)]
*  When it kind of got cancelled, I was thinking oh my gosh, you know [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2290.0s)]
*  This is the worst thing that could ever happen to me [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2293.68s)]
*  That I could ever imagine that I'm not going to be able to do [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2297.44s)]
*  A nightly talk show, you know, like this just was like this was devastating to me, you know [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2301.84s)]
*  And as time marches on and I look at all the things that I've done instead, you know [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2306.24s)]
*  You know touring doing stand-up or or moving back to the farm and and and everything in between [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2313.2s)]
*  I kind of realized man. I'm kind of [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2320.4799999999996s)]
*  Kind of glad that actually didn't work out because I if it if it if that if that show had been a big hit [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2323.3599999999997s)]
*  Then I would have been going down to the same studio every night for the last 30 years [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2328.24s)]
*  And I wouldn't have gotten to do all these other things, you know, so [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2331.2799999999997s)]
*  So, you know, Freddie got fingered of course was a idiotic movie, you know purposefully so [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2333.76s)]
*  Yeah, did you guys make that yourselves? [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2341.76s)]
*  Yeah, I wrote it with my friend Derek and we I directed it [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2343.76s)]
*  You did was it your first time you'd ever directed a movie? [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2347.0400000000004s)]
*  It was yeah. Wow. It was but it was we had a budget, you know [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2349.44s)]
*  It was 20th Century Fox we had you know, because the show was doing good on MTV. So [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2352.6400000000003s)]
*  They they let me direct it, you know, they let me do that [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2357.36s)]
*  Which was you know, probably a mistake but no they know it was you know, we really pushed it to make it like we were [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2360.0s)]
*  You know, we were 20s, you know, so the the idea was let's make this the craziest movie ever made, you know [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2366.0s)]
*  It's literally we actually believe that we could do something like that, you know, and [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2371.04s)]
*  and [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2375.6800000000003s)]
*  So it gets complicated because and you know, how do you define failure? You know, like it's [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2377.04s)]
*  It came out Roger Ebert [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2383.1200000000003s)]
*  You know like it's it it came out Roger Ebert and uh, it wasn't Cisco. It was the other guy [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2385.68s)]
*  He had another guy there. Oh, yeah the second string. Yeah, Robert Roper. They sent that guy in [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2393.36s)]
*  Yeah, even he didn't like it. Um, he didn't even Roper didn't like it. I mean it wasn't even Cisco [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2397.44s)]
*  It was it was Roper whoever that goes but it was they uh, they uh, you know [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2401.92s)]
*  Trashed it and uh, you're kind of thinking at the time man. This is devastating. You know, Ebert and Roper [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2405.7599999999998s)]
*  Trashing my film, you know, but um [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2410.7999999999997s)]
*  And and you think oh you start to question, you know what every sort of choice you've made, you know [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2414.0s)]
*  I don't know. This guy looks like he also likes canned sardines at the same time. So [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2418.6400000000003s)]
*  And it did these days who would nobody even trust the critics anyway, so it's kind of funny now that it's like [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2422.5600000000004s)]
*  Yeah at the time like it was the end of you know, the line if these guys trashed your movie [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2427.84s)]
*  Oh, yeah [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2434.5600000000004s)]
*  It's like my first movie and and it was every all the stuff riding on and then these come on just destroyed it [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2435.0400000000004s)]
*  And I remember just sitting there like watching this just thinking oh my gosh, this is it [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2440.72s)]
*  You know, this is the end but you know, it's it wasn't you know [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2444.88s)]
*  I just kept going kept doing my thing and uh, and you look back at it and go it's kind of funny now that they [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2446.96s)]
*  They didn't like it. You know, yeah, it's kind of awesome that they didn't it's weird because there's a weird sort of [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2452.2400000000002s)]
*  Counter-intuitiveness to it because we set out to make a movie that those guys would not like and then when they don't like it [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2457.66s)]
*  You're upset about it. Yeah [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2463.76s)]
*  It's like I kind of thought that they would sort of see the irony and go [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2465.44s)]
*  I know we're not supposed to like this, but actually this kid's pretty clever, you know, no, no, they didn't say that, you know [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2468.8s)]
*  What was the budget on that movie? You remember? [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2475.2000000000003s)]
*  14 million dollars they spent on that plus an additional [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2478.3s)]
*  Ten on uh, you know promotion and marketing and stuff [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2482.1600000000003s)]
*  And you know what? I will say it made it all back on dvd. Remember dvd? [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2484.96s)]
*  Remember they used to put dvds out. So I think I've heard it made 35 million on dvd [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2488.88s)]
*  So it actually was a profitable move profitable movie made 14 million at the box. I'm here defending it now [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2493.52s)]
*  It made it made his money back. I mean it's money back. No, but it did so it did make its money back [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2499.2000000000003s)]
*  But you know [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2503.76s)]
*  Ebert and robert aren't going to tell you that though. Yeah, they're not going to tell you that well [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2505.84s)]
*  It wasn't the titanic, you know, no, no exactly. It was I mean it was in a way but [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2509.28s)]
*  In the sense that it you know [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2514.8s)]
*  it bombed but you know, no, it's no it was it was uh, [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2516.96s)]
*  It's funny it's funny though because you did it though [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2520.16s)]
*  There was a long period of time there where I was made to feel like it was a really bad decision [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2522.32s)]
*  And then in the last like 10 years [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2526.96s)]
*  it's like [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2529.84s)]
*  You know all I hear are people saying they love it, you know, someone today showed me they had a x-ray cat tattoo [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2531.68s)]
*  You know like it's a character in the movie, you know [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2538.0s)]
*  so it's like um, it's it is a little confusing when you talk about sort of uh, [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2540.56s)]
*  I mean your question was how do you handle things like failure and things like that? It's like [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2545.12s)]
*  you know, it's kind of uh [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2550.32s)]
*  The more of those kind of things you go through the more you kind of learn to kind of embrace it in a way [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2552.16s)]
*  It's kind of it's almost a good thing, you know [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2557.68s)]
*  Yeah, david spit and I just wrote a movie together not to name drop or anything [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2560.48s)]
*  But nice we did and we just uh funded ourselves and stuff. And so it's just kind of a scary time [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2563.84s)]
*  I think so that's why i'm asking that as well not scary. It's it's exciting too, but it's also like yeah, I just [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2569.6s)]
*  One day i'll be like I that's something I tried to do [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2575.36s)]
*  I was trying to be creative and we tried our best and I got to try it with [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2577.28s)]

*  And oh nice repo man man kind of yeah type of shit [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2614.4s)]
*  well, you know you're the thing is that you're you're in good hands here because you're with a [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2618.0s)]
*  Guy that's done this a lot before he's done it a lot and is sort of a season like [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2622.2400000000002s)]
*  If I had to direct it to like I like to like chime in with the director and stuff like that and throw in ideas [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2626.56s)]
*  and stuff like that [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2631.36s)]
*  And uh, but it's just definitely a big learning curve. It's a lot. Yeah, so I can't imagine especially in our budget [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2632.72s)]
*  It's just a couple million bucks. So yeah, if it were really big that'd be really I feel like it'd be scary kind of yeah [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2638.56s)]
*  I mean back then we were shooting on film. Oh, yeah things cost more [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2643.7599999999998s)]
*  um, you know, it was it was at the time was considered a low budget movie, right, but uh, but um [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2647.4399999999996s)]
*  You know, I think I think that uh [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2655.4399999999996s)]
*  I don't just seems like [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2658.48s)]
*  the way [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2660.16s)]
*  things get [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2661.6s)]
*  Released these days and the ways people embrace [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2662.96s)]
*  Weirdness these days like i'm assuming it's kind of a weird movie. You know, it's odd. Yeah, just funny [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2666.48s)]
*  It's just like old school funny. Yeah. Yeah, so like a funny movie, right like [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2672.96s)]
*  You know you have this incredible thing going with your show here [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2677.36s)]
*  So you have your audience built in so you you don't really have to worry about the same things that maybe [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2680.72s)]
*  Back in the day when you put out something crazy and sort of in a sea of somewhat normal movies coming out every weekend [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2687.12s)]
*  All getting funneled through this sort of mainstream, you know cinema [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2694.56s)]
*  Right this conglomerate. Yeah, it's very strange, you know, like we had to take the movie and focus group it [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2700.24s)]
*  And then people would sit there with pads and it was in phoenix [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2706.8799999999997s)]
*  We went we flew down to phoenix to focus group freddy got that's what they do a lot of them, huh? [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2710.48s)]
*  Yeah, yeah for some reason they do them there in phoenix and you know and and and like [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2713.92s)]
*  You know then then someone stands up after the movie and asks them what what they didn't like about the movie [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2719.44s)]
*  Well with you know, freddy got fingered. I mean we're sort of [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2724.1600000000003s)]
*  You're sort of supposed to not like any of these scenes. You're supposed to be you know, kind of polarizing [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2727.2000000000003s)]
*  Yes [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2731.76s)]
*  So it didn't really kind of work with the focus group system [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2732.48s)]
*  And then you had to make changes to it and all that kind of stuff. But you're probably you guys probably [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2735.84s)]
*  Or have a lot more creative control over things. I think we'll just make a trailer and put it out [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2740.88s)]
*  Yeah, you know i'm guessing I have no idea. I'm just [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2745.2s)]
*  Part of my brain hasn't even gotten to that thought that thought yet, you know [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2748.8s)]
*  that's exciting, but it's it's definitely feels kind of yeah, it feels like just like [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2752.24s)]
*  Well, I wanted you know, we tried to do it. Who knows what will happen? You know, it's gonna be awesome [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2757.04s)]
*  Absolutely, you and spade i'm gonna go see that that's incredible. Yeah, I appreciate it. Everybody will everybody's gonna love that [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2761.6s)]
*  It's gonna be interesting. Yeah, that's what i'll say [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2767.2s)]
*  That's what I do. Yeah, I do believe that it'll be interesting. Of course it will um [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2770.64s)]
*  How did you deal whenever there were tough times like? [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2774.64s)]
*  Because you had so much of like recording yourself like setting, you know, like kind of like living under your own recording [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2777.52s)]
*  Schedule and stuff like that were there days off like when you um, would just have your show from home, right? [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2783.92s)]
*  Was there days where you would just [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2789.36s)]
*  Like take off. What was that shoot schedule like when you were when I was doing the web show at home? [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2791.28s)]
*  Well [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2797.2s)]
*  I mean it was [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2799.6s)]
*  So there wasn't really sort of uh [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2801.9199999999996s)]
*  Podcasting yet wasn't really a thing really right so [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2806.2999999999997s)]
*  So we built the studio and it would basically just stream to my website. I mean there was no instagram yet youtube had just started [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2809.9199999999996s)]
*  um [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2817.4399999999996s)]
*  and people would come and watch it on the front page of of tomgreen.com [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2818.7999999999997s)]
*  and we actually had like a [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2822.96s)]
*  company in san francisco that made like the [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2825.04s)]
*  The video playback system, you know, so it was cdn content distribution network was basically [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2827.68s)]
*  So we would upload a video to that. We there was we weren't uploading it to youtube and linking it or there was there was no [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2833.04s)]
*  youtube really [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2837.84s)]
*  so [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2839.44s)]
*  so it was kind of just a [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2840.64s)]
*  big sort of science experiment that I was doing with uh, [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2843.04s)]

*  goal of trying to [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2857.2s)]
*  sort of [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2859.2s)]
*  Make it a show that would become profitable get advertisers and [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2860.48s)]
*  Maybe sell it to television which we did a little bit of that, you know [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2864.64s)]
*  so, you know, it was kind of um [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2868.48s)]

*  fun thing to do [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2928.08s)]
*  I wasn't doing stand-up at the time. I hadn't done stand-up in years. So I was really just doing that [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2930.8s)]
*  and um [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2936.96s)]
*  you know, it was [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2939.28s)]
*  It was ridiculous. I mean we were just enjoying the absurdity of it and um, oh, yeah [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2941.04s)]
*  Was it so stressful or were you just it was because I put pressure on myself and I would actually get stressed out about it [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2946.0800000000004s)]
*  And then we would have people that would prank call us [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2952.7200000000003s)]
*  So I had this phone system on the desk and you could just call it and it would ring and I'd hit answer and so we [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2955.6000000000004s)]

*  you know, and um, it's cool and it became kind of like a little bit of a game, you know, like where we were [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2971.84s)]
*  there was a switch that I built with uh, [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2978.1600000000003s)]
*  Bill snitzer was his name. He worked there and victor a couple of the guys that worked there [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2983.04s)]
*  and uh [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2988.6400000000003s)]
*  We built the switch under the desk [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2989.6800000000003s)]
*  It was like metal [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2991.8399999999997s)]
*  And it was like we got a metal box with a switch and we had wires and we soldered them together [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2993.3599999999997s)]
*  And then the wires ran out to the computer and then bill was able to program [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=2998.3199999999997s)]
*  the computer [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3003.6s)]
*  so that when like [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3004.8799999999997s)]
*  I flipped that switch [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3006.64s)]
*  It would like if everything was off [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3008.3999999999996s)]
*  It's the middle of the night in my house [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3011.52s)]
*  It's quiet night. Nobody there and if I were to get up at one o'clock in the morning by myself [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3014.16s)]
*  And put clown makeup on which I often did [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3020.88s)]
*  And and a top hat and walk out into my living room and flick the switch [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3023.92s)]
*  The switch would turn on the lights would turn on the cameras. It would turn on the computers [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3028.32s)]
*  This computer would tell this computer to start recording [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3033.12s)]
*  Uh the phone system would turn on [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3035.92s)]
*  It would send it to the front page of my website. Just one switch. I haven't done anything [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3038.48s)]
*  Just all I've all i've done is put on some clown makeup and flipped a switch, right? [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3041.92s)]
*  You don't have to put on the clown makeup, but I did do that often [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3045.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, you better it was called the french clown of midnight. I'd speak at fran in french in clown makeup [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3047.6s)]
*  Um, and you wonder why it didn't work out [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3052.24s)]
*  but um and uh, but uh [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3054.08s)]
*  And uh, then the phone would start ringing and i'd just be doing the show [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3055.7599999999998s)]
*  I'd have a switcher on the desk so I could switch the cameras and uh, I would just start taking calls [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3058.56s)]

*  So, yeah, yeah ouch ouch [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3349.2799999999997s)]
*  They're struggling [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3352.64s)]
*  That lady is the smallest head as well [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3354.7200000000003s)]
*  If people's heads are real small, they should not talk a lot [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3357.6800000000003s)]
*  I love that. That's the that's your takeaway for this is her head size as well [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3362.32s)]
*  It is true though, by the way, I'd never noticed that but that lady is a very small head when people with small heads talk a lot [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3365.84s)]
*  it feels like they're [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3371.04s)]
*  They're cheating the system a little bit. I just feel like a regular head. You get a regular amount of words small head [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3373.2000000000003s)]
*  Less words don't over don't do too much. Right or just at least just talk in sort of the [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3379.6s)]
*  Amount of words that your head should justify your head size should yes [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3386.96s)]
*  Don't be a crazy little head just doing a bunch [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3390.8s)]
*  Yeah, I dated a girl one time with it for a while with a small head beautiful girl [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3394.16s)]
*  Great girl [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3398.16s)]
*  But knew when to talk when not to talk you wouldn't see her just yammering on like some big head. Yeah, you know [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3399.6s)]
*  So I walk in did you notice right away that she had a particularly small head or was that something that sort of dawned on [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3407.28s)]
*  You later. She had big hair big kind of italianish hair and uh [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3412.88s)]
*  Every now and then I would feel her head and I was like, oh I feel like there should be a little more head here [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3417.84s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So once you got under that the hair was puffed out probably purposefully. We probably knew that [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3422.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was small. So it was an sb. It was a mirage. Yeah [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3427.1200000000003s)]
*  And yeah hiding it a little bit. Yeah, and you'd see a little self-conscious of it. Yeah could have been [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3430.6400000000003s)]
*  But yeah, cool girl [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3435.44s)]
*  Some uh small head but knew how to use it, right? [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3437.12s)]
*  Yeah, not somebody that was ambivalent to their head size and is just running around just squawking at the moon every chance they get [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3441.12s)]
*  This is uh pretty wild that morgan and morgan has just filed a first of its kind lawsuit [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3448.48s)]
*  Against food industry behemoths [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3455.28s)]
*  That's the truth [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3458.4s)]
*  The lawsuit alleges that these companies engineer their ultra processed food products to be addictive [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3460.32s)]
*  And market those products towards children [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3466.6400000000003s)]

*  to target children [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3478.32s)]
*  with addictive ultra processed foods including internal memos [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3480.32s)]
*  Strategic meetings and the extensive research they allegedly conducted to leverage our biology and neurology [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3484.4s)]
*  To create addictive substances. We've all been hearing for years and maybe speculating [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3491.44s)]
*  That a lot of ultra processed foods [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3497.28s)]
*  Could be addictive and i'm just think it's fascinating to finally see [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3499.84s)]
*  Uh this possibility coming to light morgan and morgan is committed to fighting for the people and for the families [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3504.64s)]

*  But I got introduced to people that I didn't know [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3611.1200000000003s)]
*  And so you're always like [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3614.0s)]
*  I don't know. I always I don't usually say a lot then i'll kind of just be a listener [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3615.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, you know [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3620.8s)]
*  See I get like that too and I I wish I didn't this sort of social anxiety when you're in an environment like that [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3621.84s)]
*  Where there's just all these you know people that you admire and respect and are around you and everybody everybody it's I kind of [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3628.0s)]
*  I kind of don't even feel like myself, you know, it's a sort of a very stressful thing for me [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3635.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, so in some ways I was kind of that's a good word. It's stressful. Yeah. Yeah, and I don't know why that is [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3639.1200000000003s)]
*  Why is that? [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3644.08s)]
*  Well, I think it's because you're a little bit probably [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3645.2000000000003s)]
*  I don't know how I fit in this circle. There's a lot of circles in the world where I you're on top of the world [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3648.16s)]
*  Right now you just interviewed the president in the united states. I mean everybody you've got this incredible show [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3652.64s)]
*  I mean, i'm sure everybody was super excited to see you there [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3658.0s)]
*  So you probably don't really have any reason to feel nervous, but you still do right? [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3660.4s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I guess yeah, I just didn't know I hadn't been in that circle before it's kind of like I guess when you're in a [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3664.64s)]

*  They are seeing friends that they know it's not a huge group of people [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3680.18s)]
*  So you just want to kind of [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3684.4199999999996s)]

*  Tier of humans there or something, you know, like there was a first tier [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3751.14s)]
*  And then I was in like this a second tier of humans that were there, you know, that's got to be kind of uh [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3755.94s)]
*  Still interesting nonetheless to be there. It was interesting very interesting because I never you don't even know if like the the [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3761.7s)]
*  The process is real you see it on tv. What is like who knows if that shit's real? [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3767.14s)]
*  Who knows what's real anymore? So to witness that was pretty cool [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3770.42s)]
*  Just to be in washington dc is always pretty neat just with all the architecture [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3774.5s)]
*  um [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3779.14s)]
*  But I don't know trump like that like i'll message with his daughter sometimes evanca [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3780.02s)]
*  Okay, so i'm able to communicate with her and then what do you guys talk about? [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3784.9s)]
*  She'll just send me a book that she thinks I would like or really when we did dinner one time. She's so smart [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3788.42s)]
*  Yeah, okay. It's mind-blowing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3793.7s)]
*  And so go to dinner with her a lot or no only went one time pretty cool [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3797.7s)]
*  Was was her husband jared there or was it just you two or he wasn't it was other friends of hers. Okay [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3802.1s)]
*  Not trying to break any news here, but it sounds interesting, you know, not at all. I wish there were news to break dude [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3808.18s)]
*  She's stunning. She's awesome [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3812.98s)]
*  And then there's like a middle man like who worked with the I guess I guess he worked with the republican party [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3814.9s)]
*  And he got to invite some people. Yeah, so it was just a motley group of strange people that uh, [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3821.54s)]
*  Went to the inauguration. So how did that work? So when can I ask you questions? [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3827.2200000000003s)]
*  Or yeah, sure. Yeah, so when like when he like came on your show, right? [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3830.9s)]
*  It was right before the election and he was doing a lot of podcasts and stuff [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3834.02s)]
*  Did he did they approach you or they call you is his son was a is a fan of your show, right? [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3837.62s)]
*  Is that what he said? He said baron was a fan of the show and I tried to get to see baron [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3842.74s)]
*  But I didn't get to meet him [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3846.1s)]
*  So he just got a call one day and trump wanted to come on the show and well i'd seen i'd met trump a couple times [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3847.2999999999997s)]
*  At ufc. Okay. Yeah. Yeah ufc. I think is had everything to do with [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3853.22s)]
*  when in the election probably for [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3859.06s)]
*  for the republicans, yeah, yeah, because daniel white is just such a [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3861.4599999999996s)]
*  Um [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3865.86s)]
*  Facilitator he just gets things done [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3867.46s)]
*  He kept his sport going while all the other sports were shut down a lot of them were shut down or [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3869.46s)]
*  Uh having to practice really intense methods during covet, you know, he was able to keep his sport going like [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3874.5s)]
*  um [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3880.66s)]
*  And so he would he brought trump to a lot of his events because they've been friends for a long time [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3881.46s)]
*  And so i'd met him there a couple times and then I knew his brother died of alcoholism [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3885.86s)]
*  So I was like, well, let me call him [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3890.1s)]
*  And let me ask dana if if trump would ever talk about his brother [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3892.18s)]
*  I didn't know about it, you know [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3895.7799999999997s)]
*  And just to see what he's like like is he just all the business guy does he think about other things? [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3897.2999999999997s)]
*  because when you're [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3902.18s)]
*  You don't get a lot of [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3904.02s)]
*  You don't hear a lot about his feelings trump's feelings and if you do [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3905.54s)]
*  He doesn't communicate it in a way where it's very emotional to people. I don't feel like right [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3909.54s)]
*  So I was just curious about that. So yeah, I called up dana and he said we'll make it happen [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3914.9s)]
*  You know and then two days later he called back and he said all good somebody from his group's gonna reach out to you [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3919.22s)]
*  So you went to him, right and we went to him up in new jersey [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3924.66s)]
*  Yeah, and we offered we would have we would have loved to have um harris and walls on we're still trying to get walls on [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3927.46s)]
*  We tried to get harris on even after the election, but they just didn't want to come [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3932.98s)]
*  Yeah, and so it's kind of a bummer, you know [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3936.1s)]
*  Because I think seems like that was a pretty big mistake [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3938.02s)]
*  They didn't do didn't go on a lot of the shows that yeah, I think it would just let them be more normal [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3940.98s)]
*  I think people are if something's too much behind the glass these days people don't trust the glass [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3947.0600000000004s)]
*  I don't even think it's they don't that they don't trust the person behind the glass [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3951.6200000000003s)]
*  I think you just don't trust the fucking glass [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3954.42s)]
*  if that makes any sense, but [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3956.98s)]
*  Yeah, no it does [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3959.1400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, so I guess that was all kind of interesting [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3960.9s)]
*  I'm kind of out of sorts with the way that they're handling like the gaza palestine stuff like that shit really I think is insane [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3962.7400000000002s)]
*  To me, you know, but that's just [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3968.5800000000004s)]
*  you know [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3971.2200000000003s)]
*  You know, I don't know [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3972.82s)]
*  That's just my thoughts it's kind of a endless sort of uh, [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3974.34s)]
*  You know [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3980.34s)]
*  Quagmire you can find yourself in once you start talking [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3981.94s)]
*  When you get all the time in this world we're living in now because it's like [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3985.2200000000003s)]
*  You know you go on the road you do stand up all around the country and you know [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3989.6200000000003s)]
*  Everybody's sort of divided in a way right and then you start sort of firmly [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=3995.78s)]
*  Choosing a side and all of a sudden half the audience doesn't want to [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4000.82s)]
*  Have any fun anymore, right? So it's kind of like you got to be fine. We got to make these choices now like, okay, well [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4004.1000000000004s)]
*  Do I do I want to give my opinion anymore about what's going on in the world? Uh, you know and then [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4010.6600000000003s)]
*  you know [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4017.0600000000004s)]
*  you have to choose one of the [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4017.94s)]
*  You know set of opinions that are on this side or the set of opinions that are all evenly and neatly put on this side [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4020.0200000000004s)]
*  And as soon as you state your opinion about one of these issues that just happens to be on this side [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4026.1s)]
*  Then anybody that doesn't agree with you [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4030.66s)]
*  No longer, you know wants to wants to fuck with you and come to your show or have a good time or have a laugh with [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4032.66s)]
*  You know, so it's just such a shitty thing to have to deal with that, right? [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4038.66s)]
*  Yeah, so how do you how do you kind of like, uh, you know juggle that you know, because you know as canadian [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4041.54s)]
*  You know like it's like right now in canada people are pretty upset, you know with uh, you know with donald trump because he's putting [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4047.22s)]
*  These tariffs on canada, right? [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4053.14s)]
*  And saying they're going to make us a 51st state saying they're going to annex canada people aren't too happy about the idea of uh, [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4055.22s)]
*  You know being taken over by the united states of america doesn't it's not something that people are super excited about hearing, you know [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4060.74s)]
*  so, you know you kind of [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4067.94s)]
*  You kind of go it's funny because I sometimes I think like well [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4069.94s)]
*  I think a lot of americans who aren't don't think about it that much might think like [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4072.58s)]
*  Oh [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4078.3399999999997s)]

*  Whimsical feeling of like, you know that a 17 year old or a 23 year old would have you know [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4588.74s)]
*  But it's nice to know that that can kind of sneak up and surprise you, you know, yeah, I think kind of [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4595.48s)]
*  I mean I think uh being home where i'm from helped helped, you know, because it's like I don't know [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4603.24s)]
*  I mean if you're not from Los Angeles, then it's kind of a weird place if you're from Los Angeles [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4611.32s)]
*  It's normal, but if you're not from Los Angeles, you know, it's kind of a weird place. So, you know, you're here probably [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4616.36s)]
*  Focused on your career and your work and so many other people are it's kind of hard to I think find uh, [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4624.599999999999s)]
*  uh, you know a good uh [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4631.0s)]
*  I'm not saying it's impossible, but it seems like it is kind of harder in this environment to find somebody that you can [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4633.48s)]
*  I mean, I don't know do are people watching going? [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4638.92s)]
*  Are we going to be taking relationship advice from from from me? [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4641.96s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know if that's [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4645.08s)]
*  Well, no, it does make me think that I think I think there's this feeling in la that if you meet somebody you're going to have [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4646.76s)]
*  To eventually get them to leave here, right? [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4651.24s)]
*  There's i've always felt that thing like well if I met somebody would they ever leave here with me because i'm not going to stay [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4654.76s)]
*  Here forever, right? You know, that's exactly what I was trying to say. So that's so that I think is a yeah [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4659.64s)]
*  I think that's totally common. Um, but you're you said you [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4664.6s)]
*  You you don't live here full time now. I live in tennessee. I moved during the pandemic in nashville or yeah [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4669.08s)]
*  Oh cool. I moved here in the pandemic. Yeah, what was true whenever trump was talking about canada? [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4673.8s)]
*  What was can you bring it up nick? [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4677.320000000001s)]
*  Just I just want to know what he even was saying like what were they threatening they were threatening the tariff [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4678.360000000001s)]
*  Canadian goods just so our listeners can know what exactly was even going on. Yeah [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4684.12s)]
*  they're gonna put a [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4689.4800000000005s)]
*  tariff on [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4691.4800000000005s)]
*  Every, you know, you know canada is the largest trading partner of the united states [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4693.4800000000005s)]
*  nice and so so much of the [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4697.4800000000005s)]
*  Goods that come into the united states from canada [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4700.280000000001s)]
*  Are you are being brought in by american businesses to you know, like wood you bring wood and lumber in to build houses, right? [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4704.04s)]
*  so when you put a [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4710.360000000001s)]
*  25 tariff on lumber that means everybody that flannel if you're a big flannel company making flannel pajamas [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4711.72s)]
*  All of a sudden flannel pajamas are going to be 25 more expensive. So it's really it's going to affect [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4717.88s)]
*  You know businesses on on both sides of the border, obviously not just canada, but also everything will go up in price [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4723.08s)]
*  um, so [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4730.04s)]
*  You know and uh, i'm not exactly sure the reason for it to be honest with you. I uh, he was really saying they weren't [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4732.2s)]
*  Helping out with border security. Yeah, and that's what yeah, which is 30 days [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4740.5199999999995s)]
*  Probation period they did put a bunch of people out the border. Absolutely. And then I don't think there's a real border security problem between canada [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4745.3s)]
*  And the united states though. It's uh, [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4752.84s)]
*  You know, it's uh, but uh, that's the hardest country to get into in the world. I think is canada [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4755.08s)]
*  Yeah, I mean it's it's going that way there isn't that's for sure [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4760.04s)]
*  Yeah, it's uh, [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4764.360000000001s)]
*  You know the the claim that there's fentanyl coming into the united states from canada [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4765.72s)]
*  I think is a little bit exaggerated because I don't really think that that's actually [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4769.72s)]
*  the case something like [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4774.12s)]
*  You know, uh very small amount is coming in from canada [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4776.84s)]
*  So tariffs are a central part of trump's economic plans [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4780.12s)]
*  He promised to introduce import duties against some of america's main trade partners during his election campaign [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4782.52s)]
*  He said tariffs will boost u.s. Manufacturing and protect jobs as well as raising tax revenue and growing the economy [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4787.64s)]
*  fentanyl is linked to tens of thousands of overdose deaths [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4793.4s)]
*  Taking bold action to hold mexico canada and china [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4796.76s)]
*  Accountable to their promise of halting illegal immigration and stopping poisonous fentanyl and other drugs from flowing in our country [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4799.54s)]
*  It just seems kind of vague [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4805.72s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's sort of like uh [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4808.76s)]
*  But like what would you do like i'm trying to see say if you bring a bunch of stuff in uh, my country, right? [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4811.24s)]
*  Say if you and I live in different countries and you bring a bunch of stuff into my country [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4816.599999999999s)]
*  I bring a bunch of stuff in your country [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4819.5599999999995s)]
*  And then you say okay i'm gonna tax that more i'm gonna charge you more to bring that in [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4822.04s)]
*  If you don't help stop the fentanyl that's coming in [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4827.16s)]
*  I just I don't know. How would you then do that? What would you then on your side? [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4830.44s)]
*  Would you say okay? We'll put more what drug dogs and security along the board there? [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4833.5599999999995s)]
*  I think that's what he's asking them to do [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4837.96s)]
*  I you know, and and I think we already do have uh again. I'm not [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4840.36s)]
*  I know i'm not a representative of the canadian government, but I do I do uh think that we already do have a lot of [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4845.8s)]
*  There's only so much you can do to seal off a border, right? [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4852.2s)]
*  And I don't think there is that much fentanyl coming in from canada. I never heard that that was a thing [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4855.24s)]
*  Yeah, I think it mostly does come in from the southern southern border [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4859.88s)]
*  That's what I would think. I wonder if maybe that you guys got grandfathered into some [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4862.92s)]
*  You know some late night trump rhetoric there who knows it feels a little bit like that [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4867.16s)]
*  But you know, hopefully uh, hopefully it'll resolve itself [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4871.16s)]
*  I do think that it's probably going to end up causing a lot of economic problems on both sides of the border and probably [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4874.2s)]
*  they may [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4881.48s)]
*  May not go for it, but you know sports exciting for a while though. Yeah, exactly [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4882.68s)]
*  That's a side effect. It was a good fight right off the top of the game the other day [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4886.84s)]
*  You know, it's pretty cool. We like a good hockey fight [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4890.2s)]
*  So that's cool and it is nice when countries sometimes don't get along a little bit in sports, right? [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4892.5199999999995s)]
*  I've always i've always admired that yeah [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4896.92s)]
*  That's why it's one thing I don't like about the nba anymore that all the players it seems like they all know each other [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4899.32s)]
*  Nobody's really playing for their squad sometimes. Okay, so I like a little bit more that animal fights in the nba with good physical fights [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4903.08s)]
*  Yeah, look at that [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4910.36s)]
*  Oh, definitely. I believe both those players are american, too [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4911.72s)]
*  I'm not sure how quickly your researcher can tell us that but even though they the canadian team [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4914.84s)]
*  Canada didn't get the win in this game. I know that's not true at all what I just said, but but uh, [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4921.88s)]
*  I don't think canada got the win in this game [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4926.44s)]
*  But that's okay. Yeah, we lost the game. Absolutely, which is really kind of uh, I know [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4928.5199999999995s)]
*  But it is nice to see everybody having a good time watching a hockey fight for sure. Yeah, absolutely [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4934.2s)]
*  You know, so um, what else did I see in the news that I just saw was happening? [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4938.759999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah, it was that contraception begins at erection now [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4943.16s)]
*  So there's a law that they're pushing ohio democratic lawmakers propose con conception begins at erection [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4948.599999999999s)]
*  Okay, yeah, they're trying to put it on the men a little bit more [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4954.599999999999s)]
*  So what exactly are they going to do about this now? [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4957.72s)]
*  Well, a new bill in ohio would make it a crime for men who ejaculate without intending to have a baby [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4960.2s)]
*  Oh, wow, that is that's definitely something that I could see [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4965.24s)]
*  A lot of people probably would be guilty of for sure. Hey shoot and shoot, you know [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4970.44s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I could see that being I mean, I don't want to get in too much personal detail, but I think I'd probably be [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4974.599999999999s)]
*  Locked up for a long time [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=4980.5199999999995s)]

*  There's a lot going on in my life when I actually got the call to do that show. Um, and to do saturday night live [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5219.72s)]
*  and um [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5226.12s)]
*  You know, it was really cool though. The thing that was cool about it was um [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5228.04s)]
*  you know lauren michaels [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5232.36s)]

*  sort of [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5238.2s)]
*  kind of sort of uh [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5239.8s)]
*  Overwhelmed that I was it was asked to do it, right? [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5241.62s)]
*  Yeah, and uh, I had a couple of friends who I grew up with who worked on my show with me and I said [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5244.44s)]
*  You know, can they come in and like kind of work with me and do some help write some skits and stuff [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5249.8s)]
*  So they gave us a little office and that stuff we went in there we used to sort of writing skits up and everything [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5253.88s)]
*  and uh [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5259.0s)]
*  you know [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5260.76s)]
*  They actually kind of ended up giving [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5261.88s)]
*  Me a lot of kind of creative freedom on the show to kind of write sketches and stuff and um [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5264.76s)]
*  You know in hindsight, I kind of wish they hadn't no [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5271.0s)]
*  Like they had just written themselves. Yeah [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5274.4400000000005s)]
*  Well, because because we really kind of made some really weird fucking sketches [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5276.4400000000005s)]
*  You know [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5279.4800000000005s)]
*  I think maybe it would have been cool if I maybe i'd just gone in and done the stuff that they had written [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5280.04s)]
*  but like I was I was sort of [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5283.8s)]
*  definitely [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5286.1s)]
*  you know [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5287.8s)]
*  Freddy got fingered hadn't come out yet [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5290.36s)]
*  So like I I was still kind of riding high on this hit show and we come in and we said, okay now [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5292.28s)]
*  Let's write some crazy sketches, right? [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5297.08s)]
*  And uh, I mean the stuff we wrote was really really [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5299.72s)]
*  Weird, you know and um and uh [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5304.36s)]
*  Were you intent on making it weird do you feel like I think we were yeah like how weird can we make this [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5307.88s)]
*  It's s and l let's make it ours. I think so. I think so [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5312.12s)]
*  And uh, you know, sometimes I think there was a miscon [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5315.24s)]
*  Misperception maybe among some of the cast that I brought my own writers in which wasn't really the case. It was more like um [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5317.94s)]
*  It was my buddies and I was they'd come up with me with the show [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5324.44s)]
*  You know, it was kind of like we were you know when we made the show in canada [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5328.28s)]
*  They some of my friends came down with me [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5331.96s)]
*  To the states to like this is part of the team. It's not just i'm bringing [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5334.68s)]
*  I want them to be included in in the in the in the show [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5337.48s)]
*  So we kind of went in and did that but I mean it's uh, it was an amazingly exciting experience [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5340.04s)]
*  I mean my parents were there on stage with me, you know, um [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5344.84s)]
*  You know those it was one of those things where you kind of [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5349.56s)]
*  Can't believe that you actually that it actually happened while it was happening, you know, and uh, I did a lot of sketches with will ferrell [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5353.16s)]
*  One one of the like here's an example of something that I I wouldn't say I regret this but like uh, but um, I kind of regret this [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5360.4400000000005s)]
*  um, so [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5368.04s)]
*  So there was a there was a sketch where i'm a wizard and i'm holding a pig like an actual pig [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5370.04s)]
*  And uh, and it was molly shannon and will wow [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5377.400000000001s)]
*  I'm a wizard and I didn't really have any lines in the sketch or many lines in the sketch [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5380.6s)]
*  It was mostly will and molly were doing this sketch and but I noticed during rehearsal that if I like if I just kind of lightly [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5385.88s)]
*  Sort of tickled the pig's [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5393.4800000000005s)]
*  Belly with my finger that it would start to squeal extremely loud, right? [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5395.8s)]
*  And so I did that once during rehearsal and then somebody said oh you better not [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5401.56s)]
*  You know, she'll squeal if you touch her belly. And so I said, okay [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5405.4800000000005s)]
*  And there's a rehearsal show and then there's the actual show, right? [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5410.04s)]
*  And you know, I kind of maybe regret this but I did note that [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5414.360000000001s)]
*  Okay, let's get through the rehearsal show but then live [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5419.4800000000005s)]
*  I'm gonna make that pig squeal. Yeah [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5423.160000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so it did kind of I am a pig [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5427.0s)]
*  No, but it was it was kind of uh, it kind of threw the the sketch off a little [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5431.320000000001s)]
*  I realized that it did kind of throw the rhythm of the of the comedy off a little bit but uh, [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5436.52s)]
*  How many times did you squeal it was just sort of became sort of a bit of a bit of a mess [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5441.96s)]
*  But uh, and were you getting a squeal every time he touched his belly or do you have to really no? [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5447.24s)]
*  I just had to kind of just lightly sort of pet her there and she would just try [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5451.96s)]
*  You know, so it was but it was amusing to me, but i'm not sure if anybody else enjoyed it that much [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5456.36s)]
*  Oh, yeah, but uh, so it was like that if you touch her lunch, you know [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5461.08s)]
*  She fucking gets a little animated if you grab any of her takis out of her little dish, right? It was like that [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5464.44s)]
*  Yeah, so so but uh, um, you know, it was no it was an amazing experience. I was total honor to be able to do it [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5469.879999999999s)]
*  and you know, I mean I I [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5476.5199999999995s)]
*  You know, it was cool. I mean the the cast was jimmy Fallon tina fe will ferrell [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5478.839999999999s)]
*  Uh chris katan molly shannon anna gastire, uh [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5483.48s)]
*  Tracy morgan and you know, um [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5489.48s)]
*  You know there was [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5493.959999999999s)]
*  It's a weird environment like saturday night live, especially when you're young and you don't really know like, you know [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5496.2s)]
*  We're talking earlier about like going to [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5502.36s)]
*  You're talking about going to chris rock's party and like you didn't know how to act or whatever because there's all these people here [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5504.36s)]
*  And it's just kind of complicated. Yeah [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5509.56s)]
*  so you're getting thrust into an environment like that and then it's [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5511.8s)]
*  Even as the host it sort of felt like kind of a competitive environment because you know all the cast members are trying to [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5517.16s)]
*  Write sketches and get them on the air [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5523.4800000000005s)]
*  Everyone every week and and I didn't really know how it worked really at the time in hindsight [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5525.72s)]
*  I now realize how it works and I you might have done things differently [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5530.12s)]
*  But you know when we were trying to put these sketches on the air that we were writing [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5533.88s)]
*  Maybe that was kind of pushing another sketch off and we didn't really I wasn't really thinking of it like that [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5536.92s)]
*  so it kind of created it kind of it's kind of a weird environment and [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5541.4800000000005s)]
*  you know the more I kind of [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5545.64s)]
*  you know [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5547.64s)]
*  Sort of hear people on podcasts who've been on the show talk about the show [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5549.5599999999995s)]
*  It seems like everybody's gone through that experience who's been on that show where it's very competitive and and stressful for people [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5553.08s)]
*  and that made that makes me feel a little bit better about my experience there because you know was [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5559.16s)]
*  it was kind of uh, uh, you know a stressful experience, you know, because you know, everybody's going to be watching the show it's live and [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5565.32s)]
*  You know, i'm uh, you know [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5572.759999999999s)]
*  You're doing all this weird stuff. That's not necessarily [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5575.16s)]
*  You know, i'm i'm a little bit out of my element. I didn't do sketch comedy. Yeah, that's scary [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5578.28s)]
*  So it was it was it was but it was cool [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5582.679999999999s)]
*  It was cool [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5584.919999999999s)]
*  It sounds like it's par for the course a little because yeah [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5585.32s)]
*  I mean even adam stendler the other night was singing he had a musical tribute that he did to the 50 years [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5587.16s)]
*  and um [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5592.36s)]
*  He referenced a couple times about people having sketches that they wrote that didn't get on the show [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5593.5599999999995s)]
*  So I think that seems like it was just a weekly occurrence [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5597.639999999999s)]
*  And of course you want to go in there with a little bit more comfort zone for yourself [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5600.5199999999995s)]
*  You know, it's like yeah if we can write a couple of them or we can have some manipulation over them [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5604.679999999999s)]
*  It's probably gonna make you feel more comfortable, you know another thing that was weird that happened on the show. So [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5609.0s)]
*  like [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5614.2s)]
*  So there was a sketch that I did. Oh, let's call it a sketch like I did with will ferrell where we're both dressed as eagles [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5615.48s)]
*  and uh [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5623.32s)]
*  This was one of the ones that my friends and I wrote [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5624.5199999999995s)]
*  Okay, it's sort of hard to sort of say that we wrote it but the sketch was [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5626.92s)]
*  uh, you know, uh [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5632.12s)]
*  Jimmy Fallon and and molly shannon are looking at will and I who are eagles, right? [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5634.28s)]
*  We wrote this out by the way on paper and handed it in and then they said to do it [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5639.32s)]
*  and then uh will and I [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5643.639999999999s)]
*  uh decide to fly [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5645.719999999999s)]
*  Up into the audience. Okay [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5648.84s)]
*  And uh, I thought it would be fun to go in the audience. So we fly into the audience [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5651.24s)]
*  And then we chew up carrots [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5655.88s)]
*  And then I believe will chews up a carrot and I believe he sort of spits the carrot into my mouth [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5658.12s)]
*  And then kind of [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5665.8s)]
*  We end up sort of uh, because you know how baby birds will chew up the food and feed it [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5667.64s)]
*  Mother birds will chew up the food and make it easier for the baby to eat. So this was [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5672.04s)]
*  The sketch we did [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5677.64s)]
*  um, oh, yeah, but so [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5679.64s)]
*  Oh god, so somehow I kind of maybe probably would have been better if we just kind of did the sketches that uh, [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5682.4400000000005s)]
*  That their writers have written. Oh god, huh? Yeah [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5688.04s)]
*  And these are both males, huh? [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5691.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5693.320000000001s)]
*  So we're doing this. Yeah, exactly. So we're doing this. Uh, what zoo is that at? [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5694.84s)]
*  That's what i'm talking about. That's the west hollywood aquarium right there brother. I'll tell you that [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5699.56s)]
*  Yeah, so we're doing this sketch [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5705.400000000001s)]
*  this the skit and uh [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5707.400000000001s)]
*  So, you know when you host the show you gotta run to get ready for the next sketch because you got to shake off your eagle [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5710.36s)]
*  Costume and put on another costume, right? [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5714.839999999999s)]
*  Another and so so i'm running down the stairs and i'm running through the backstage area and just sitting in the darkness [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5716.92s)]
*  You know just backstage tom hanks is just sitting there in front of a monitor watching the show and i'm in the eagle costume [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5723.48s)]
*  I just done that [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5729.879999999999s)]
*  I make eye contact with tom hanks. So now i'm like [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5731.32s)]
*  I was already kind of nervous [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5734.4400000000005s)]
*  now like I got tom hanks in the in the dark watching and i'm going like [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5736.68s)]
*  How did that eagle sketch go, you know? [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5742.2s)]
*  and [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5744.84s)]
*  I'm sort of getting ready for the next sketch [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5745.96s)]
*  Not sure how the eagle sketch went and tom hanks is watching so it kind of throws you a little bit [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5747.8s)]
*  But then there's a big after party after the show and tom hanks was real nice [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5752.68s)]
*  And he you know was hanging out talking to my parents and stuff and so it was pretty cool [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5756.12s)]
*  but uh, no, it was an amazing thing it's a [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5760.2s)]
*  It's a kind of thing though like it's kind of like you go geez [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5763.0s)]
*  It would be nice to be able to do it again someday because I think like doing it the first time is is sort of so [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5765.32s)]
*  I don't know that that would ever happen. But uh, you know, probably in an alternate universe [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5772.28s)]
*  I might be able to do it again someday but but uh, you know, like you go [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5776.44s)]
*  Okay, I sort of understand how the system of it works now [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5780.04s)]
*  and um [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5783.72s)]
*  and uh, it would be uh, you know, probably [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5785.24s)]
*  You know, I probably would not have done that [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5789.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but also it's great that you did though. It's so epic [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5792.6s)]
*  And yeah, I think you're right about that's like a lot of things in life [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5796.360000000001s)]
*  You're like man [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5799.160000000001s)]
*  I wish I had gotten a trial run or I had a little bit of an idea of how the feelings were [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5799.72s)]
*  or what the energy was like in that space or that room or like [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5804.360000000001s)]
*  man, there's been things you go out on a stage part of a show or [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5808.360000000001s)]
*  banquet some type of thing and you you just [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5811.9400000000005s)]
*  Play play the room totally wrong, you know [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5814.84s)]
*  That didn't seem like that but there's definitely times like that in life and you wish you like man [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5817.639999999999s)]
*  I wish I'd get one more swing at it. Yeah. Yeah, but and you know, I think that uh, you know that generally you can [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5821.639999999999s)]
*  At least take those lessons and apply them to something else. Oh, yeah for sure [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5830.12s)]
*  So yeah, did um was michael jackson there whenever you guys played who was y'all's musical guest? [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5834.679999999999s)]
*  Uh, no was not michael jackson, but that would have been amazing if it was michael jackson. No, it was david gray. Uh, [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5839.24s)]
*  Oh, yeah [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5845.32s)]
*  but um [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5847.0s)]
*  Man, it would have been amazing. Not no nothing against david gray, but have you ever had michael jackson? [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5848.28s)]
*  Have you ever [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5854.52s)]
*  Interacted with michael jackson, uh in any way or no, no that would have I mean that would have been amazing [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5855.72s)]
*  but yeah, he was great and uh [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5860.92s)]
*  I would love to see uh [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5863.96s)]
*  Another weird thing that happened on the show one thing was weird that happened on the show [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5867.0s)]
*  So I was backstage getting ready for the I don't even I should tell the story [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5871.48s)]
*  I don't even know if I should tell the story. Uh, maybe it's not let's talk about something else. Okay, it's a weird story. No worries [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5875.48s)]
*  Yeah, tom hanks was here the other night I didn't get to see him. Oh, I got to see madonna she's little [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5883.4s)]
*  Okay, where was that such a little baby carrot? [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5888.44s)]
*  um [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5891.4s)]
*  She was at that snl thing. Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah, it was interesting. So you're chatting with madonna. No, no, no [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5893.56s)]
*  She's quite quite interesting on tiktok these days. Oh is she she's just some pretty [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5899.4s)]
*  Uh sort of out there stuff on her tiktok. I got a follower. I gotta check her out. Um when you have these um [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5905.0s)]
*  You beat cancer, right? Has it flared back up? What's that been like? No, it's no no, it's completely gone [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5912.76s)]
*  Do they have to take out one of your gonads or not? Uh one testicle [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5918.6s)]
*  Yeah, my my right testicle and some lymph nodes as well [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5921.8s)]
*  But uh, and what are the lymph nodes like is that actually in the testicle or is that in the body are actually? [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5924.84s)]
*  Behind your intestines and they have to like they cut me up here and they had to remove those [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5930.84s)]
*  And that was just to check to see if the cancer had spread into them [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5935.400000000001s)]
*  Wow, and you know [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5938.76s)]
*  The only way they could really check and know for 100 sure if it had spread was to take them out and look at them [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5940.04s)]
*  Under a microscope and stuff. So so they had not spread so then that meant I did not have to have chemo and stuff [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5944.280000000001s)]
*  But they did take my right testicle, which was [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5949.08s)]
*  Uh, honestly, like when I found out the show was on mtv at the time and you have it still yeah [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5951.72s)]
*  I did not keep it like [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5956.84s)]
*  Indefinitely, but that is it in a plastic bag right there [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5959.38s)]
*  How many ounces is it? You know, I I don't remember weighing it exactly but I know it's quite heavy for sure. Oh hell yeah [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5963.16s)]
*  But uh, yeah, no, we don't have no light testicles around here [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5971.48s)]
*  But uh, we filmed the whole uh the whole um [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5977.48s)]
*  sort of uh [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5980.84s)]
*  Surgery, uh and for a show on mtv. That's actually the the whole show there the cancer special which is on youtube [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5982.28s)]
*  But you'd see my documentary on prime too where it kind of walks through that hole [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5988.36s)]
*  That's glenn humplick who is the my friend and co-host on the show and here he is sort of after my surgery coming down and [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5992.44s)]
*  And playing with my testicle a little bit of sashimi there. It's a little sashimi [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=5998.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he sets what he says. It sort of looks like chicken and then my mom says I don't know what kind of chicken you're eating [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6002.12s)]
*  Yeah, so that is my cancer infected testicle right there [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6007.0s)]
*  But you know, I still have the left one. It's the middle one now [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6010.599999999999s)]
*  I can still ejaculate just a little no, it's pretty good actually. Heck yeah, dude [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6015.16s)]
*  It's gonna cost you 10 grand if you drive over to ohio and do it. I'll tell you that bro [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6018.759999999999s)]
*  Look, why would you stop in mishawaka? Only five grand for me. Uh, yeah [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6024.2s)]
*  Which is a benefit to having in ohio to have a testicular cancer you can kind of god brother [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6031.719999999999s)]
*  The terrorists they would rack up they'd make a million bucks a night in that state. That's not a bad idea [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6036.92s)]
*  Not a bad idea for sure. Um, did you ever wear a prosthetic testicle? It was offered and I uh, I refused to do it [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6041.72s)]
*  I did not refuse but I just sort of uh, opted out on the uh, on the prosthetic. Did you ever look at him at least? [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6047.88s)]
*  I think I did. Yeah, I think I did. This was you know, 20 years ago, but uh, I [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6054.68s)]
*  I'd heard the doctor kind of said, you know, a lot of people get them don't like it [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6060.280000000001s)]
*  They say it kind of sort of feels weird or whatever so I just figured no, I don't need one [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6063.32s)]
*  So, yeah, you know, but uh, I mean, I don't know how much you want to talk about my ball sack [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6066.679999999999s)]
*  But I mean it doesn't really seem that much different like down there like I mean [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6071.08s)]
*  oh, I could imagine that totally as you're kind of just kind of sort of sort of morphs into kind of like uh, because like the [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6074.679999999999s)]
*  like the um [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6080.84s)]
*  like they don't like um, like um, they don't actually like [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6082.92s)]
*  Go through the scrotum to get the testicle. You know that like they don't actually cut the scrotum [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6088.2s)]
*  Oh, no, no, they go in the cut your like up sort of up up here like on your like under your your pubic hair [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6092.36s)]
*  Kind of yeah under your pubes [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6097.8s)]
*  They go in there and then they kind of go in and they just sort of shuck it out like an oyster from above [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6099.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, so it's sort of not really [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6104.04s)]
*  Like the scrotum is completely intact, you know, like there's not some sort of you know, sort of [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6107.16s)]
*  Scarred scrotum or anything like I don't have a scarred up scrotum. Yeah. Yeah, it's totally normal scrotum. Yeah good [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6111.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, like there's a little scar up here, but i'd had a i'd had a hernia operation before when I was like, uh, [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6117.8s)]
*  You know younger so they just went through the same thing [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6123.8s)]
*  So it's like you wouldn't just a little scar there. Yeah, so a lot of hernias in canada, too [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6126.280000000001s)]
*  What country has the most hernias you think? Yeah, that is interesting. I never thought of it about that [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6130.52s)]
*  But is there a lot in canada or is it a lot of my friends canada had hernias? [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6134.92s)]
*  A lot of your friends in canada have had had hernias really. Yeah, i'm just wondering that is is I i'd be curious to see if [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6139.240000000001s)]
*  There's more in canada that would be certainly an interesting statistic for sure according to available data countries in south asia and sub-saharan [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6145.16s)]
*  africa didn't have the highest prevalence of hernias [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6152.76s)]
*  Particularly in regions with lower socio-economic status with countries like india and parts of tanzania showing significantly higher rates [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6155.88s)]
*  Compared to high-income nations. This is largely due to factors like limited access to health care and higher rates of manual labor. Wow [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6162.2s)]
*  I gave myself a hernia on [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6169.24s)]
*  my show [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6172.28s)]
*  Live on the public it was on the public access version of the show years before we were on mtv [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6173.48s)]
*  and um [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6179.48s)]
*  It was kind of a strange episode probably one of the weirder ones where we said [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6180.919999999999s)]
*  Okay, i'm gonna break the guinness book of world record records for the longest fingernails [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6185.4s)]
*  You know you ever seen those? Oh, yeah, we used to see them all the time [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6190.5199999999995s)]
*  We're kids and the chinese kid on the bikes remember that the world record book [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6193.16s)]
*  Yeah, they'd have a 15 or 16 a whole just a starter pack of asians all hanging off a bike [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6196.919999999999s)]
*  Exactly [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6202.76s)]
*  So for whatever reason [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6204.36s)]
*  This was this this doesn't even sound like it could even possibly make sense to describe it [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6206.36s)]
*  But the idea was okay. I'm gonna it was glenn and myself. It's a live show. It was on community [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6210.52s)]
*  Cable, you know, it's not on a big network, you know, so it was sort of late at night [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6215.96s)]
*  And we said okay what we're gonna do is we're gonna try to break the record for longest fingernails [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6221.4800000000005s)]
*  And I had a bunch of milk [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6225.56s)]
*  Calcium and I set it up all very seriously and then I start drinking milk [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6227.32s)]
*  and then for the entire hour, I just basically drank milk and kind of [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6232.5199999999995s)]
*  Stared at my fingernails for an hour and didn't do anything right just kind of progressively got a little bit more [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6238.44s)]
*  Kind of sort of weird and then at the towards the end of the show [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6245.639999999999s)]
*  I kind of stood up and started thrashing around sort of somewhat violently. I don't know. There's no real logical reason for it [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6249.8s)]
*  It was like a milk overdose or something and I threw my start doing this thrashing and I [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6255.8s)]
*  Hit the desk and I flipped the desk over and [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6262.04s)]
*  and I felt something pop in my abdomen and then we went off the air and [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6264.92s)]
*  I went up to the bathroom and my intestine was like pushing out through my through my abdomen [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6269.96s)]
*  and uh [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6275.8s)]
*  Went to the hospital and I had given myself a hernia. Oh, so so that's well, that's how that happened [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6277.0s)]
*  Was that probably the worst accident you ever? [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6281.96s)]
*  Endured, uh, no [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6284.2s)]
*  The worst one ever was just two years ago. I stepped on a fire in uh [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6288.2s)]
*  On the beach in costa rica the old fire step, huh buried under sand [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6294.68s)]
*  and uh, I walked up to this bonfire and the edge of the fire had been buried and I my foot went into it and uh, [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6300.68s)]
*  Yeah, I got third degree burns [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6309.24s)]

*  Something that I expect to really go viral in a lot of ways because it's like very long form stuff that I just really [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6482.4400000000005s)]
*  Like shooting like that. I I mean, yeah [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6488.360000000001s)]
*  Do you notice you like almost it almost seems like it's almost like you'd want to shoot like a feature like a movie [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6490.92s)]
*  I can't tell [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6496.68s)]
*  You know, I don't know because you know, sometimes we have things that start to happen and then it becomes something else, you know [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6497.88s)]
*  yeah, but when i'm watching it, I feel like i'm [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6502.28s)]
*  Getting into a i'm getting into a world. Yeah, that's what it feels like. Yeah, that's cool [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6505.72s)]
*  That's cool. I mean like to know that you watched it because it sort of is sort of [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6511.48s)]
*  It's not like i'm a mainstream comedy sort of piece that i'm putting on my youtube channel right now [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6515.96s)]
*  It's it's you know [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6521.88s)]
*  I want to kind of just capture what it feels like being out in the desert and in these amazing places or being on the farm [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6522.84s)]
*  with with the animals and uh, and so, you know, I like I like [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6528.599999999999s)]
*  shooting and capturing images that are sort of [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6532.5199999999995s)]
*  Calming and beautiful and and it is the kind of thing that you know, it's it's you know [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6537.4800000000005s)]
*  The show's not like that the show's there's a lot more going on. But the the there is something nice about just kind of [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6543.08s)]
*  putting it on and uh [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6549.0s)]
*  Sitting back and just kind of like it's like an asmr type of thing. Yeah, that's what it feels like [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6550.6s)]
*  It's like asmr for your eyes kind of yeah. Yeah, so it's uh, it's interesting [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6554.76s)]
*  I mean [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6558.12s)]
*  I think a lot of it started just as me kind of like really trying to experiment with the cameras and just trying to figure [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6558.360000000001s)]
*  out how to make these cameras [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6563.0s)]
*  Work and capture the sort of the cinematography the way I want to capture it [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6565.16s)]
*  And I think that maybe it may evolve into something a little bit more faster paced at some point [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6568.6s)]
*  but right now it's just it's just a lot of this sort of slice of life stuff that I put up on the youtube channel and [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6574.04s)]
*  And uh, you know, I have a podcast that I do, you know [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6579.64s)]
*  One episode every six months or something like that [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6583.08s)]
*  I might start doing the podcast again and putting that up to kind of [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6585.48s)]
*  Give people something a little bit more familiar to watch but uh right now. Yeah, that's that's what it is [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6589.16s)]
*  And I just I I kind of [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6593.4s)]
*  Just enjoy [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6598.44s)]
*  Taking people to these places [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6600.12s)]
*  I mean, I find it interesting that like, you know, everything's so fast paced now like, you know [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6602.599999999999s)]
*  Everything is so people's attention spans are so short now [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6606.84s)]
*  that it's kind of interesting to sort of do something that's kind of [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6610.44s)]
*  not that and uh [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6615.08s)]
*  again, it's [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MtCvJGi-30&t=6617.16s)]
