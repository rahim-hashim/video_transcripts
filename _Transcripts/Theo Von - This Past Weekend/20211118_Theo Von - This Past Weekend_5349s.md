*  We're happy to have that bird man with us today. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=59.040000000000006s)]
*  Turkey farmer Robert Hupman. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=62.660000000000004s)]
*  Robert Hupman, we're sitting here with the turkey farmer, baby. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=84.34s)]
*  This is your time of year really coming up. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=104.7s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=106.78s)]
*  We generally, it's kind of funny. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=107.78s)]
*  We get that a lot, but we're year round, you know. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=109.62s)]
*  So Thanksgiving is just another day for us. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=112.8s)]
*  We're pumping turkeys 24-7. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=116.25999999999999s)]
*  Oh, dang man. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=118.25999999999999s)]
*  I feel like people, do you wake up on Thanksgiving morning and you're like fired up and the kids [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=120.47999999999999s)]
*  are all, you know, they're fired up and people are doing like turkey calls. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=126.92s)]
*  Is it that kind of a day for you guys? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=131.82s)]
*  How big of this time of year is y'all's market share basically? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=134.8s)]
*  For our market share, it's probably, I don't know. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=141.02s)]
*  And I don't know what market share means also. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=145.16s)]
*  Yeah, so generally we're growing birds year round. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=146.64000000000001s)]
*  So if my flock happens to go out before Thanksgiving or a month before, fine. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=149.20000000000002s)]
*  If it doesn't, it's probably about, I don't know, 30% of what a true turkey farm goes [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=152.64000000000001s)]
*  through because we're pumping out. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=161.36s)]
*  We're selling breast meat for, you know, lunch meat and other items like that. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=162.92000000000002s)]
*  So I've had some, I mean, I don't know if I've had you guys. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=167.36s)]
*  How do I know if I've had you guys' turkey? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=170.02s)]
*  Most likely if you ever had a Dietz and Watson sliced turkey, that'd probably be one of ours. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=172.82s)]
*  Damn man, thanks. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=177.94s)]
*  Yeah, I've loved it. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=178.94s)]
*  We sent some stuff out. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=180.14s)]
*  When you lived in LA, I think California buys some of our product as well. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=181.52s)]
*  Oh good. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=185.5s)]
*  Yeah, I probably enjoyed it then. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=186.5s)]
*  Okay, so for just a regular human, right? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=188.06s)]
*  I'm a human consumer. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=190.86s)]
*  What part of the turkey is used for, like, I guess let me start here. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=194.42s)]
*  I'm just trying to think of where to start with a turkey farmer. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=201.51999999999998s)]
*  You want a day in the life of a turkey farmer? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=204.39999999999998s)]
*  Start to finish? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=207.48s)]
*  What do I go through? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=208.48s)]
*  Yeah, what's it like when you get up in the morning? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=209.48s)]
*  What does it go like? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=212.16s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=213.16s)]
*  Yeah, so I'll wake up. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=214.16s)]
*  I don't even know why I'm here. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=215.16s)]
*  No, you're good. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=216.16s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=217.16s)]
*  I've never been good, but that's sweet of you. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=218.16s)]
*  Yeah, Robert, so what is it like? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=220.48s)]
*  So you start in the beginning of the day. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=222.39999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, so normally I wake up 3.30, 4 o'clock a.m., do a little paperwork, knock some emails [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=224.42s)]
*  out, go through the birds. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=229.14s)]
*  Luckily right now I've got a full-time farmhand. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=232.1s)]
*  This is the first time ever. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=234.01999999999998s)]
*  So I don't have to be up there as much. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=235.85999999999999s)]
*  But we're going through them every day. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=239.1s)]
*  You're checking for any type of mortality, making sure. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=241.07999999999998s)]
*  They all have automatic feeders. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=243.76s)]
*  So there's one feed line that runs continuously down the barn, 800 and some feet long. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=245.1s)]
*  So a feeder that runs down the barn that they're all housed in? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=249.72s)]
*  Yep, they're housed in. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=252.78s)]
*  They have plenty of room, ample amount. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=253.78s)]
*  Biosecurity is key. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=257.48s)]
*  So we dress up, suit up, go through, dip pans, make sure nothing comes in from the barn that's [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=258.56s)]
*  not supposed to be in there. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=264.08s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=265.44s)]
*  Yeah, we're very to the niche. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=266.44s)]
*  We do animal welfare every year. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=268.48s)]
*  We're really on top of our game because this is our livelihood. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=270.96s)]
*  This is what I feed my kid with. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=273.8s)]
*  And sometimes commercial farms, they'll call it commercial farms, but it's really just [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=276.6s)]
*  a small town guy. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=281.29999999999995s)]
*  It's a family maybe running a dairy operation, maybe running cattle. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=282.94s)]
*  And then they're also substituting some income for other family members for turkeys. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=286.73999999999995s)]
*  So I can make the same. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=291.58s)]
*  I make the same amount of money as if I was running maybe 200 head of cattle. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=292.58s)]
*  OK, wow. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=296.17999999999995s)]
*  So with the amount of turkeys you're running. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=297.17999999999995s)]
*  And how many birds are you guys, you know, how many birds are you guys dealing with over [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=299.41999999999996s)]
*  there? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=303.73999999999995s)]
*  So roughly like 19,000 to 22,000 per flock. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=304.73999999999995s)]
*  And that's two barns. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=308.5s)]
*  So OK, so 19,000 per flock. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=310.12s)]
*  So what does that mean? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=313.28000000000003s)]
*  So generally we have a flock and it'll last 19 weeks to a full grown bird and they go [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=314.72s)]
*  to market. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=321.6s)]
*  OK. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=322.6s)]
*  And then depending how it rotates, you know, you'll have like four weeks down, eight weeks [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=323.6s)]
*  down depending when they're ready to place you with more poults or more turkeys from [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=328.40000000000003s)]
*  the hatchery. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=331.56s)]
*  OK, so it starts with you get a batch of turkeys. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=332.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=335.6s)]
*  So you have no turkeys at some point. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=336.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=337.6s)]
*  So you'll have a downtime for four weeks when we're cleaning turkey shit. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=338.62s)]
*  OK. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=342.02000000000004s)]
*  So you're just cleaning out the barns. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=343.02000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=344.02000000000004s)]
*  So OK, so then you get the batch, right? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=345.02000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=348.74s)]
*  They come in, fresh shavings land. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=349.74s)]
*  You know, we've spread out brand new shavings. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=352.06s)]
*  And they're all shaved out? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=353.90000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, we clean and poof out. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=355.1s)]
*  It's all nice, nice, clean, pretty, pretty, pretty ground for them. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=356.34000000000003s)]
*  Strip club up in there, son. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=359.62s)]
*  Nice, nice lights. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=361.18s)]
*  OK, so you get them in and they are they scared or they excited? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=362.18s)]
*  What do they seem like? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=366.58000000000004s)]
*  They're ready to eat. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=367.71999999999997s)]
*  OK. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=368.71999999999997s)]
*  So they've done travel, got their they're really happy birds or clucking. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=369.71999999999997s)]
*  They've been on the road to chill out. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=373.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=374.8s)]

*  They come in. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=376.8s)]
*  It's nice and warm in there for them because when they're younger, they like it up, you [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=377.8s)]
*  know, around the 80s to 100, depending on the age of the bird. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=381.32s)]
*  OK, so you guys have lamps and stuff? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=384.4s)]
*  No, they keep them warm. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=385.84s)]
*  Pro-pane heaters. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=386.84s)]
*  Yeah, we got propane heaters. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=387.84s)]
*  OK. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=388.84s)]
*  And so they're all in this hat. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=389.84s)]
*  And at that point, you already bought them from a hatchery. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=391.91999999999996s)]
*  So they're all in this barn. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=394.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=396.24s)]
*  So you have them in this barn now. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=397.34000000000003s)]
*  How long until those birds until you guys, you know, you pull that card on them, you [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=400.18s)]
*  know, lowered them out and send them on to the market? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=406.3s)]
*  Nineteen, eighteen and a half to 19 weeks. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=408.62s)]
*  Wow. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=411.66s)]
*  So there. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=412.66s)]
*  And then when they go out there, you know, averaging 40 to 45 pounds. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=413.66s)]
*  OK. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=416.14s)]
*  How well the feed conversion. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=417.14s)]
*  OK. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=418.14s)]
*  So and that is you guys are feeding them the whole time. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=419.14s)]
*  How often do you feed them? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=421.54s)]
*  They eat nonstop. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=422.82s)]
*  They have that way. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=423.82s)]
*  They have access to water and food the entire time. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=424.84s)]
*  They're like my buddy, Cory, dude. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=429.24s)]
*  And will they eat? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=432.64s)]
*  And what are they eating? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=434.59999999999997s)]
*  Corn? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=435.59999999999997s)]
*  It's a corn, soybean and then sometimes wheat. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=436.59999999999997s)]
*  And it's all natural. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=439.64s)]
*  We have our own hatchery. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=441.06s)]
*  So y'all ever got them and give them a little snack at night? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=442.06s)]
*  Is there any kind of a bedtime snack? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=444.64s)]
*  Is there anything where you're going to sneak out there? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=446.44s)]
*  You feel in a good mood. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=448.88s)]
*  You're going to go out there and hook them up? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=449.88s)]
*  No. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=451.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=452.88s)]
*  They're like, I don't want moon pie. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=453.94s)]
*  But they're like, no, we're good. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=454.94s)]
*  So they just like what they they're real. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=455.94s)]
*  No, no, they really just like that. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=457.94s)]
*  That feed, that corn, soybean max. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=459.78s)]
*  I mean, that's pretty much it. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=462.42s)]
*  Their water. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=465.21999999999997s)]
*  We have a water system. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=466.21999999999997s)]
*  I mean, they get in perfect pH every time. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=467.21999999999997s)]
*  OK. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=469.02s)]
*  So like we're really, really big on their water. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=470.02s)]
*  So it's like a little spa in there. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=471.9s)]
*  They're treating, you know, they got the heat going. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=473.38s)]
*  They got the food coming in. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=475.42s)]
*  They're really living. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=476.7s)]
*  They're living pretty large in there. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=477.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=479.34s)]
*  OK. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=480.34s)]
*  Curtains go down. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=481.34s)]
*  They get natural light. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=482.34s)]
*  I mean, they're they're safe from any type of predators. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=483.79999999999995s)]
*  Sounds like a detox I went to one time, honestly. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=487.47999999999996s)]
*  Be real honest. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=489.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=491.96s)]
*  Now, what about this? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=492.96s)]
*  So so so then you go in there and your daily routine, you cruise in there, cruise in there. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=493.96s)]
*  You have a special, you know, you got the gear on because you don't want to. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=498.44s)]
*  How detrimental is it if you bring in something from the outside world? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=501.15999999999997s)]
*  So just for instance, you probably heard of avian flu. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=504.44s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=507.08s)]
*  So like back 2016, 15 and 16, they had a huge outbreak. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=508.09999999999997s)]
*  Killed a million plus birds nationwide. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=513.54s)]
*  Damn. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=515.6999999999999s)]
*  Which it helped. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=516.6999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=517.6999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=518.6999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=519.6999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=520.6999999999999s)]
*  So it you know, we didn't luckily hit it. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=521.6999999999999s)]
*  And I hate to prosper on, you know, bad terms for other farmers because I hope we all get [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=523.38s)]
*  our right to do and everybody is successful. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=527.5s)]
*  But it helped us out and bumped us up real high. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=531.9s)]
*  And we did very well not having that avian flu. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=535.12s)]
*  But it's literally if I went outside, stepped in some goose crap and that fecal matter [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=538.4s)]
*  was on my shoe. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=542.92s)]
*  If I stepped in that barn with the same clothes I had on with that, it would 100 percent affect [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=544.6s)]
*  and mortality rate kill. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=549.8399999999999s)]
*  No way. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=550.8399999999999s)]
*  Within like three days. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=551.8399999999999s)]
*  Damn. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=552.8399999999999s)]
*  So they're a real it's a real it's almost like a they sound like almost like a science [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=553.8399999999999s)]
*  Not a science experiment, but they're like a real specific recipe. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=560.94s)]
*  If you put in a little bit of something that's not good, it's going down. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=565.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=568.38s)]
*  And see like a real sensitive. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=569.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=570.38s)]
*  So other birds can affect other birds. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=571.38s)]
*  Same like you can't have chickens on a turkey farm. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=573.02s)]
*  Same I can't have turkeys on chicken farm. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=575.3000000000001s)]
*  Stuff that would mess with a chicken will mess with a turkey. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=577.1600000000001s)]
*  Oh really? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=580.0600000000001s)]
*  And it won't won't seem like the geese that fly. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=581.14s)]
*  You know, they're they're just a carrier. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=583.46s)]
*  They don't they don't die from the avian flu, but they can spread it to other birds. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=585.38s)]
*  Even if say the. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=589.5999999999999s)]
*  Damn, it's like Succession. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=590.5999999999999s)]
*  Have you seen that show? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=591.5999999999999s)]
*  No, no, I actually haven't. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=592.5999999999999s)]
*  It's like, yeah, it's like family members trying to they're just not it's not just like [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=594.4399999999999s)]
*  that, but it's similar. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=599.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's just like, you know, the same breed you think everybody be looking out for each [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=600.4399999999999s)]
*  other, you know, goose is going to fly by and get a little intel or something. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=604.88s)]
*  Drop a note. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=609.04s)]
*  But instead, yeah, it's a family right here. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=610.04s)]
*  The front guy almost look like he got a little gobble on him. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=612.5999999999999s)]
*  But they are they're all like rich people and they're all like backstabbing. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=615.28s)]
*  Yeah, all the same breed. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=618.62s)]
*  I did see the first season now that you said that. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=619.9s)]
*  Yeah, I got I've just seen a little bit, but I got to see some more. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=621.98s)]
*  But anyway, so this is really cool. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=625.14s)]
*  So so now you go in there, you guys are kind of like you. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=627.98s)]
*  You're careful what you bring into the barn. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=630.7s)]
*  Yeah. And you get in there. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=632.94s)]
*  It's it's the early morning. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=635.22s)]
*  And then what are you guys doing at that point? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=636.62s)]
*  So we're going through making sure, you know, none of the water lines are broke. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=638.4200000000001s)]

*  The feeds all properly distributing through the lines. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=643.54s)]
*  OK. Occasionally, you'll have a mortality. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=646.38s)]
*  One bird might just crow from what could have been anything, just anything heart, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=648.5s)]
*  liver, you know, just sometimes you just, you know, you have so many birds in there. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=652.86s)]

*  They might have small beef going on in there. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=679.16s)]
*  They, you know, occasionally they do fight, you know, they'll occasionally [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=681.08s)]
*  rough up each other. You got to break them up. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=683.92s)]
*  Will they? Yeah. Yeah. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=685.76s)]
*  They're like, no nonsense. Keith Peterson. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=687.12s)]
*  Maybe you got to get in there like her being right in between. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=688.84s)]
*  OK, so now you got the farm going. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=693.24s)]
*  Everything's going pretty swell. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=695.08s)]
*  At what point do you guys start to get them ready for the slaughter? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=696.92s)]
*  Basically, what do you call it? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=701.6s)]
*  Just just harvest. OK. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=703.36s)]
*  Just kind of like [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=706.26s)]
*  same as if you're harvesting corn, just for getting ready to. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=708.16s)]
*  It's a I don't know, just going out or whatever. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=712.86s)]
*  Birds go out. That's kind of OK. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=715.94s)]
*  We're going they're going out. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=717.78s)]
*  We got a group coming in. We got a going out. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=718.86s)]
*  Yeah. So it's a nice way to say it. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=720.78s)]
*  They say it at senior homes, too, a lot of times, you know. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=722.08s)]
*  You know, Don is going out. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=724.5s)]
*  Yeah. You know, we got a question that came in right here for you, Robert. Yeah. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=726.04s)]
*  What up, Theo? [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=729.94s)]
*  Turkey farmer, how you doing? [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=731.46s)]
*  Yeah, I got a little question for you. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=733.7s)]
*  So I assume you're taking these turkeys in [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=736.58s)]
*  and you know, you got to kill them for meat, you know. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=741.04s)]
*  Are you the one who's doing these killings? [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=743.86s)]
*  How do you go? Do you just chop its head off? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=745.7s)]
*  How do you go about this? [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=747.96s)]
*  Is it peaceful? It's a long process. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=749.88s)]
*  And do you ever develop some sort of relationship with a certain turkey? [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=752.2s)]
*  Maybe he does like a little dance or something that you think is funny [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=756.42s)]
*  and something unique about him that you don't want to let him go. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=761.12s)]
*  You don't want to send him off some family for dinner. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=764.24s)]
*  So, yeah, have you ever kept one of these turkeys for a prolonged period of time? [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=767.16s)]
*  And that's about it. That'll do it right there for me. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=773.16s)]
*  They are. He's out gang, brother. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=775.74s)]
*  I hope you guys close, but he might not be. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=779.32s)]
*  You know, that's the world we live in, man. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=781.16s)]
*  Is this, you know, it is turkey farm. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=782.74s)]
*  Your interview. That's a good point. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=784.46s)]
*  Yeah, I'd say topic I'd send in. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=786.16s)]
*  So I'd be naked to talk to him about bird man. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=788.78s)]
*  Dude, I'm bringing my bird. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=792.3199999999999s)]
*  You know. So there you go. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=793.48s)]
*  That's a nice question. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=796.02s)]
*  What would you say that like when it comes time to shut them down? [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=796.9399999999999s)]
*  Right. You got to do it. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=800.36s)]
*  It's got to be done as part of it. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=801.8199999999999s)]
*  So so that's another aspect of the farm throughout. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=803.36s)]
*  There's birds that that need to be called either. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=806.8199999999999s)]
*  They get a broken wing, broken leg. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=809.78s)]
*  So something happens. They twist their stuff up. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=811.9399999999999s)]
*  You just got to euthanize them, you know, immediately. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=815.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, we don't want a bird to suffer while they're there. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=817.8199999999999s)]
*  We don't want they can't get food, water and they can't properly move. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=820.16s)]
*  We just go ahead and take them out. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=823.12s)]
*  Because what happens if a bird's in there, if a bird's in there [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=825.28s)]
*  and he can't move, then what's going on? [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=828.0s)]
*  The other birds will kill him. No way. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=829.54s)]
*  Yeah, we don't we don't let that happen. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=832.0799999999999s)]
*  And why do they do it? What's going on in there? [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=834.78s)]
*  Do you have any intel? [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=837.1999999999999s)]
*  Just turkeys being turkeys, man. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=838.38s)]
*  The real world, man, they don't care. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=840.3399999999999s)]
*  And it's like damn Sinaloa. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=842.54s)]
*  Yeah. So that's why I was telling Spence over there that we [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=844.38s)]
*  they're kind of like kids when they first come in, they're, you know, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=848.38s)]
*  love it and they're happy. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=851.06s)]
*  And then they turn into teenage assholes trying to kill you. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=852.88s)]
*  Just like in Jiu-Jitsu class, little kids start start cool. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=856.68s)]
*  And then next, you know, they're every beating up on the old man. Yeah. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=859.38s)]
*  OK, well, so you got the birds now, you guys. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=864.68s)]
*  And when they when they when they do, when they do send them out to harvest, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=867.26s)]
*  when they send them out, what's the process? [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=870.18s)]
*  Do they line them all up and just neck them out? [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=871.94s)]
*  Now, this this probably a little while. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=874.52s)]
*  We'll bring in 19 tractor trailers and hand load them on three guys. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=876.06s)]
*  They'll bring them up. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=881.9399999999999s)]
*  It's like a little escalator takes them right up and they [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=882.8s)]
*  pick one up, put them in the cage, load the cage up. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=886.02s)]
*  Truck goes down, turns back around. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=888.64s)]
*  They can load a truck up in like 35 minutes and they gas it. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=890.02s)]
*  Well, they take them back to the processing facility and that's I think they use [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=893.56s)]
*  like a CO2 base and they'll just put them to sleep. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=896.56s)]
*  Then they're cutting them up. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=899.66s)]
*  Really? Shing them up the conveyor belt. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=901.14s)]
*  So they put the meat to they just put them to sleep. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=902.86s)]
*  So they're not shooting them. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=905.34s)]
*  It's not like a bullet or anything. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=906.44s)]
*  No, no. Yeah. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=907.72s)]
*  So like on the farm, you got two options for your animal welfare. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=909.14s)]
*  You can either they have like a bolt gun, like a cap gun. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=912.98s)]
*  You hit them in the back of the head with it and they'll just take them right out. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=916.9s)]
*  Or some farmers rig up like a little box with CO2 and they'll put them in and that away. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=919.98s)]
*  They go night just go to sleep and then you put them in the compost [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=925.02s)]
*  and then we compost the birds for crop rotation. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=928.24s)]
*  We'll put them on fields and stuff. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=931.24s)]
*  Oh, so they'll become a fertilizer almost. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=932.9s)]
*  Yeah, we'll create fertilizer. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=934.66s)]
*  You know, all natural. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=935.9399999999999s)]
*  So you so you guys don't do the actual. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=937.3199999999999s)]
*  So the killing isn't actually done by you guys. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=940.9s)]
*  It's shipped. It's like outsourced. Yeah. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=942.5799999999999s)]
*  So now so now I will, you know, we have a bugsy seagull out there. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=944.5799999999999s)]
*  This rolls up. Yeah. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=948.4s)]
*  So we will kill birds and ones I have to call. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=950.16s)]
*  I'll I'll pull the meat out for friends and family. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=953.0799999999999s)]
*  Cut the breast meat. I got some pictures. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=955.16s)]
*  I'll give you guys and you can show them the size of the breast and stuff like that. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=956.62s)]
*  But damn, yeah, man. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=960.1999999999999s)]
*  Constant. OK, so so what were we talking about? [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=962.78s)]
*  The hit man, the guy comes in, the trucks come in, we load them out at night. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=965.16s)]
*  And then they start to they go to the plant. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=969.62s)]
*  They get, you know, processed up and then they're out the door [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=974.2s)]
*  within like 24 to 48. So you don't see them back. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=977.82s)]
*  You're not there putting them in the box. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=981.04s)]
*  You're not there putting them in there. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=982.38s)]
*  I watch them go out and make sure everything runs smoothly on my end. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=983.88s)]
*  That way, the birds are, you know, safely loaded. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=986.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Send them away because that's you know, that's our livelihood. Right. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=988.84s)]
*  Yeah, that's the work. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=992.0999999999999s)]
*  I mean, look, that's what it is. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=992.9399999999999s)]
*  I mean, people love it. I mean, yeah. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=994.4799999999999s)]
*  I mean, I think people do anyway. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=996.3599999999999s)]
*  Has the has the turkey market? [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=997.76s)]
*  Have people been buying less turkey over time? [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=999.56s)]
*  What's going on with Turkey? [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1001.78s)]
*  So Turkey's like influx. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1002.9s)]
*  So you'll get two years of like markets up and it'll drops back down. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1004.3599999999999s)]
*  Then it'll go back up. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1008.8199999999999s)]
*  And generally, that's because when they go up, Butterball and these bigger [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1010.16s)]
*  companies will come in and be like, we need to put 100 more houses across here. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1013.42s)]
*  So they'll flood the market with Turkey. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1017.54s)]
*  Then they'll sit there because we don't freeze our birds, our kids out fresh. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1020.1s)]
*  Like, what do you mean? [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1023.5600000000001s)]
*  They say we need to like, what do you mean that they're adjusting the market [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1024.64s)]
*  when they need to put more houses? [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1027.8600000000001s)]
*  So they'll see the market value, you know, Turkey value go up. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1029.64s)]
*  And then what does it get to? [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1032.44s)]
*  You know, all the pounds. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1034.8600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, like breast meat might be four something, five something a pound. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1036.74s)]
*  You know, they really throw the or then it will be as low as a dollar [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1040.78s)]
*  when it crashed because they'll have a lot of birds frozen. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1044.28s)]
*  Those bigger companies hold that stuff. Oh, I see. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1046.8600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, we really specialize, you know, not only in just Turkey growth. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1049.44s)]
*  We were the first ones doing antibiotic and organic turkeys. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1052.94s)]
*  We have two different divisions and we're considerably a small company [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1055.94s)]
*  compared to Cargill or Pilgrim's Pride or Tyson. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1059.74s)]
*  Tyson's huge. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1063.8200000000002s)]
*  And Butterball is the biggest turkey company probably in the world. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1064.8600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I used to watch. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1067.94s)]
*  Yeah, I know. I've had some Butterball before. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1071.2s)]
*  I'm sure. Yeah. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1073.2s)]
*  Yeah, they're I don't know if I like they're not. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1074.2s)]
*  I remember. Now, what about this guy is a question right here. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1075.96s)]
*  This Italian guy. All right. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1079.08s)]
*  What's up, Theo? What's up, Turkey farmer? [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1082.6799999999998s)]
*  Got a question, man. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1086.04s)]
*  What's up with the free range and the natural and organic and the regular? [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1088.08s)]
*  Is that just a farce? [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1094.8799999999999s)]
*  Is it the real deal? What are you buying at the stores? Thanks. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1096.72s)]
*  That's that's a good question. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1100.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, it's a great question, man. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1101.76s)]
*  Yeah. What is it? What how do they divide that up? [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1102.84s)]
*  What do you guys have to do? Do you guys have to? [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1104.9199999999998s)]
*  So so if it's like the other farms are more like the organic farms [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1107.04s)]
*  or antibiotic free, that's a it's heavily regulated. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1111.88s)]
*  So you got a lot more paperwork and actually like to be an organic turkey. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1114.92s)]
*  It has to come for organic females. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1120.34s)]
*  All those the closest organic female to us, I believe, is in Pennsylvania. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1122.06s)]
*  So we have contract farms and P.A. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1125.76s)]
*  that grows grows that particular bird. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1128.14s)]
*  OK, so so so a lot of what goes in, I heard this. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1129.78s)]
*  I have a friend that works for like a meat company called Cow or something, I think. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1132.44s)]
*  And but it's K.O.W. right. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1136.94s)]
*  And he sent me some fancy meat one time and it's good. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1139.58s)]
*  But, you know, it's still expensive. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1142.82s)]
*  But he was saying that what determines grass fed, it's just [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1146.3799999999999s)]
*  it's certain like really regulations don't even really have to do [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1152.78s)]
*  something with their eating. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1155.58s)]
*  It's just where they live at things like that. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1156.58s)]
*  What so what's that like for you guys? [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1159.46s)]
*  So you have the different different levels. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1161.1599999999999s)]
*  So like a you or whatever they call it's antibiotic free. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1163.12s)]
*  Only difference in between that is if, say, a bird gets like a common cold or something, [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1167.72s)]
*  you wouldn't be able to treat it with like our pen or a penicillin [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1172.5s)]
*  for like one or two days. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1175.5s)]
*  And everything's done very properly with a vet. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1177.1599999999999s)]
*  You know, we have a vet that checks the bird. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1180.08s)]
*  It's it's just a crazy industry. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1182.46s)]
*  But they they make sure they've really went and step, [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1184.4199999999998s)]
*  you know, from what it used to be to now. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1187.96s)]
*  Yeah, it's by the book. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1189.76s)]
*  Everything's clean and done professionally. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1191.06s)]
*  But so was it used to be the used to be this the damn dark art. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1193.6399999999999s)]
*  From from what I hear back in, we've been doing it since 89. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1197.8999999999999s)]
*  And it's been fairly consistent all the way up. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1200.72s)]
*  Just, you know, more regulations and we were wanting to stay on top of everything. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1203.34s)]
*  Yeah. But for like a free range bird. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1207.3s)]
*  So all they'll do is they'll take my barn, build doors, and then the doors will open [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1211.48s)]
*  and then they can go out in a fenced in area. OK. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1216.06s)]
*  Sometimes they don't even go out like my buddy grows a free range. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1219.56s)]
*  Yeah, they free free range chickens. Same thing. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1223.22s)]
*  He spent all this money. They leave the doors open. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1226.98s)]
*  The birds are inside where it's nice and safe anyway. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1229.6s)]
*  If it's sunny, they might come out for a little bit. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1232.1799999999998s)]
*  Check up and then they see a hawk or something. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1234.36s)]
*  No, I tell it back. Yeah. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1236.6399999999999s)]
*  Maybe Andy Dufresne sneaks out at night or one of them or one of them government geese. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1238.1799999999998s)]
*  Drop a turd down there. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1241.94s)]
*  I'm just saying you think there'd be a lot more of that Madagascar type activity, you know, [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1244.48s)]
*  somebody trying to really put it through a dirty spider in Charlotte's Web out there, you know. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1250.28s)]
*  But OK, so what are the different types, different varieties of turkey [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1255.1200000000001s)]
*  that's for sale on the market? [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1259.44s)]
*  You're just going to have the antibiotic free. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1260.74s)]
*  You're going to have an organic bird, free range bird, and then [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1262.54s)]
*  what they call a cage free bird, which no bird is caged up in a little cage. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1267.1200000000001s)]
*  That's just a fake narrative that people create to try to give people bad name farmers. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1272.34s)]
*  Sure. And no bird is completely cage free either. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1277.1999999999998s)]
*  Like you got to have some sort of way to keep the bird or it could leave. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1280.1599999999999s)]
*  Right. Can turkeys leave? [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1283.54s)]
*  Well, I mean, I've had it where they're smart enough to turn the doorknob [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1285.08s)]
*  and whack it open with their wing and actually try to make a jailbreak. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1290.04s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1293.58s)]
*  But that's that's far and few between the turkeys are in a wide open barn. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1295.12s)]
*  You know, you're looking at one barn's [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1299.46s)]
*  40,000 square feet per barn. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1304.8200000000002s)]
*  OK, so you guys get out there, you got all the turkeys, they come in and they go out. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1308.0800000000002s)]
*  And like so around Thanksgiving, like is there an extra batch? [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1313.68s)]
*  Do you double up on your batches, like starting in like October or something? [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1317.22s)]
*  Or, you know, would you say it's not in 19 weeks? [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1321.44s)]
*  19 weeks. So that's that's for heavy, Tom. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1324.98s)]
*  And if it's going for when we're doing like turkeys for Thanksgiving, [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1327.28s)]
*  they're probably they're probably putting them in, they're taking them out at half that. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1332.1200000000001s)]
*  So they're probably going out around 13 to 15 weeks. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1335.2s)]
*  A medium sized bird. OK. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1339.24s)]
*  And that's the one that most people buy for Thanksgiving. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1341.08s)]
*  That's what they're going to buy for Thanksgiving. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1343.24s)]
*  And they'll put these specialty birds just for that. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1345.1200000000001s)]
*  And they're their medium Toms is what they'll call them. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1347.16s)]
*  Yeah. And how do they get the name Tom? [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1350.54s)]
*  It's genetically, I guess that's what you call, you know, [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1353.72s)]
*  a Tom and a hen. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1357.28s)]
*  And we'll have hens in there occasionally because they'll sex them, [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1358.32s)]
*  but they don't always get them right. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1361.32s)]
*  So you have big old hens mixed in there with the Tom. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1362.4s)]
*  Is there trans turkeys? [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1365.58s)]
*  Do you start to see that even in like the turkey? [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1367.04s)]
*  They don't really identify other other than Tom and hen. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1369.46s)]
*  And maybe, you know, you'll find a dominant. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1372.54s)]
*  I found hens with beards on them. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1376.2s)]
*  Maybe they're maybe they're transitioning. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1378.1200000000001s)]
*  Oh, I found some of them, too, around town. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1380.1200000000001s)]
*  I've definitely had one of my buddies had a real issue with them. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1383.16s)]
*  But he's doing good now. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1387.56s)]
*  I mean, he's doing pretty good anyway. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1389.78s)]
*  He's on like a ranch right now in Montana. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1391.08s)]
*  But the holidays are the most wonderful time of the year. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1392.7s)]
*  It's a good time to to hug somebody and to tickle somebody. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1397.6200000000001s)]
*  You don't even know that well, if you want legally. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1400.78s)]
*  And in a safe area. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1405.1200000000001s)]
*  With more people shopping online every year, you got to ship stuff, man. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1407.78s)]
*  You got to damn get things out of your possession and into somebody else's [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1411.0s)]
*  possession, even Santa. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1413.9s)]
*  I heard a rumor some he's not even going to some countries anymore [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1416.2s)]
*  because of the crime and stuff. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1418.84s)]
*  And he's going he's just going to ship stuff there. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1420.08s)]
*  He's going to use ShipStation. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1422.34s)]

*  Well, let me think what I want to ask right now. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1538.54s)]
*  So you got these different types, you got the males. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1539.9399999999998s)]
*  So can I eat a male [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1542.86s)]
*  turkey or a female turkey at Thanksgiving? [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1547.34s)]
*  Can I have either one? Yeah, potentially it might be either or. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1549.5s)]
*  So I don't have any idea. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1552.62s)]
*  Wow. Now, my mom know if it comes in the kitchen and she's in there doing it. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1554.4199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, you would never know. Really? [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1558.3s)]
*  Yeah, because so we sell turkey fries. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1559.84s)]
*  OK. And that's turkey nuts. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1562.86s)]
*  So they're they're they have glands and their nuts are actually in their wings. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1565.22s)]
*  No way. Yeah. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1569.78s)]
*  So they'll pop them things out and you fry them up. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1571.1799999999998s)]
*  They good or bad. They're good. Yeah. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1574.6999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, they're do they bust a little or they just kind of. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1576.74s)]
*  Now they just fry them up. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1580.6599999999999s)]
*  It's just like, you know, eating it. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1581.6999999999998s)]
*  Like a what? This is like a nugget, like a chicken nugget. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1583.54s)]
*  You know, you get you eat nuggets. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1586.3s)]
*  Is this them right here? Yeah. Wow. Yeah. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1588.54s)]
*  Yeah, they're good, man. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1592.8s)]
*  We've served them at numerous meetings or, you know, congressmen [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1593.96s)]
*  and senators and stuff go to the Turkey Federation meeting. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1597.08s)]
*  We used to have them there. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1599.46s)]
*  I mean, I just say elk nuts like a week ago because we went out elk hunting [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1601.6s)]
*  and our guide fixed up a nice rocky mountain elk parmigiana. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1606.3999999999999s)]
*  Well, I think, look, Joe Rogan can apparently eat his own penis. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1612.32s)]
*  I read the other day on the Internet. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1615.3999999999999s)]
*  So I think at this point, everything's everything's fair game. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1616.56s)]
*  Yeah. If I was starving, I'd eat one of my nuts right out of my damn body, [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1621.34s)]
*  I think, you know, because they feel it feels like you have to heal up. Good. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1624.22s)]
*  Yeah, I'd have one. I'm going to have both of them. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1628.5s)]
*  Like some creep, you know, but. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1631.02s)]
*  OK, so. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1634.08s)]
*  Do why does Turkey look so ugly, though? [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1636.96s)]
*  And is that a fin if I say that? [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1640.8s)]
*  No, I mean, they're, you know, they are calling my babies. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1642.22s)]
*  But yeah, no, I mean, like that. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1644.46s)]
*  But you know what I'm saying? Like to me, because I actually went jogging this morning [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1646.44s)]
*  and I go jogging on this around this lake and there's a lot of turkeys out there. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1650.04s)]
*  Not this time of year, actually. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1653.88s)]
*  But usually there's a lot of turkeys out there and they're just big. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1655.2s)]
*  And they're they're just not the most attractive. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1658.24s)]
*  You know, they're not peacock. But right. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1661.04s)]
*  You know, they are. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1663.6200000000001s)]
*  I don't know. They're pretty majestic for the most part. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1665.56s)]
*  It's probably just the beauties in the eye of the beholder for the most part. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1668.24s)]
*  Some people love turkeys, love the way they look. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1671.88s)]
*  A lot of my buddies are turkey hunters. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1673.88s)]
*  So they're they're all about getting every every species of turkey [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1675.34s)]
*  hunted and mounted and displayed as wall art for, you know, their memory of that hunt. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1678.34s)]
*  Yeah. And they like eating them too. They're delicious. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1683.26s)]
*  Oh, yeah. You kind of figure they probably were at some point, some type of raptor. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1687.6s)]
*  If you go back to dinosaurs. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1692.56s)]
*  Maybe they've just evolved. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1694.3799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Like your little fur got a little smaller claws, but they still try to cut you. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1695.72s)]
*  Yeah. So you get a chance. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1700.02s)]
*  How sharp is that talent? [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1702.78s)]
*  How could that thing get you or not? [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1704.4s)]
*  Oh, yeah. I mean, I've had them where they cut through my pants. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1706.62s)]
*  I sent sent some pictures over where they've gotten me [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1709.32s)]
*  in the leg in the back. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1713.66s)]
*  I mean, they they're with our turkeys. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1716.04s)]
*  We don't have spurs. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1718.54s)]
*  So so they'll they'll have those at the hatchery. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1720.3s)]
*  They'll have them nip. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1722.8s)]
*  And so we really don't get messed up. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1724.0s)]
*  But their front calls, you know, when they jump up, [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1726.34s)]
*  they're jumping up with their feet to latch on. OK. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1728.84s)]
*  You can see that. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1731.6s)]
*  Yeah. So that's a scar from there. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1732.3999999999999s)]
*  Look, I got some cam haze boots and save my toes. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1733.94s)]
*  But oh, yeah. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1736.1799999999998s)]
*  But the rest of you, you need that full cam haze. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1737.86s)]
*  Yeah. He needs to come out with some leggings or something for me. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1740.24s)]
*  Dying yoga pants or something. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1744.44s)]
*  So that's one turkey talent did that to you. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1746.8999999999999s)]
*  Now, what is their talent look like? [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1748.98s)]
*  What is their leg? What is that leg look like? [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1750.28s)]
*  Let's see their leg of the foot. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1752.24s)]
*  OK. The one that spread out. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1754.24s)]
*  You see, so they got these toenails and that's what's got. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1756.6599999999999s)]
*  That's that's what cut me. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1760.28s)]
*  Well, they stay now. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1761.8s)]
*  Oh, wow. So they have. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1763.94s)]
*  So they have a spur. Ours are docked. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1766.02s)]
*  So they won't have that long spur like on a wild turkey. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1767.78s)]
*  That will be there, but it'll be nubbed off because they cut them off. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1770.8999999999999s)]
*  Yes. You don't want that in there because they'll kill each other. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1774.3s)]
*  We murder him like all sorts. Wow. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1776.98s)]
*  I wouldn't even go through there at a point if they were like that. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1779.24s)]
*  But now those claws. And like I said, you'll see turkeys. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1782.54s)]
*  You got videos of turkeys fighting out in the wilderness. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1785.3999999999999s)]
*  Same thing. Just bigger bird. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1787.32s)]
*  They're going to jump up at you. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1788.98s)]
*  They'll try to get you. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1791.26s)]
*  I mean, I've had them peck me in the forehead, working on the feed line, [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1792.64s)]
*  getting motors put back on. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1795.22s)]
*  They can. And do they seem manipulative? [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1797.26s)]
*  What do turkeys seem like as a very nice at first? Yeah. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1799.52s)]
*  So, you know, they're like, hey, what's up? [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1803.3600000000001s)]
*  You can be sitting there and they'll kind of come up and you can, [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1804.98s)]
*  you know, pat them on the head. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1807.24s)]
*  And then just next thing you know, they turn around, run around, say, [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1809.1200000000001s)]
*  you know, John, look at this. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1811.78s)]
*  And then they'll fucking hammer you. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1813.58s)]
*  Yeah. So it's if you can work in two [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1816.48s)]
*  a lot of times, I've been doing this so long by myself. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1819.5600000000002s)]
*  Some of these repairs. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1822.2s)]
*  And I mean, they'll pick motor lines, everything where I have to go [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1823.0600000000002s)]
*  and replace electrical. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1826.16s)]
*  They'll break water lines down where they'll rip the line, tear the water up. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1828.4s)]
*  And I got to get in there before it floods the barn. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1831.94s)]
*  I mean, they can they can be destructive. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1833.9s)]
*  Does it seem calculated, though? Does it seem like they have it does? [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1836.44s)]
*  Yeah. So we take every measure when we go through. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1839.74s)]
*  We're tying up lines, making sure if there's a will, there's a way. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1841.5800000000002s)]
*  Turkey will definitely fuck something up. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1845.0s)]
*  But does there will seem to be that they want to create anarchy? [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1847.6000000000001s)]
*  Does it seem that they want to escape like what they want to know? [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1850.54s)]
*  You can literally leave the door open. They won't go nowhere. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1853.4s)]
*  Oh, I see. They'll just chill out, maybe put the head out. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1855.8s)]
*  They're just kind of like, what's up? [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1858.68s)]
*  But I think it's more like you're kind of like fresh meat in prison style. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1860.0800000000002s)]
*  You walk in there, they're like, well, I'm a get you boy. Oh, damn. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1864.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. And now this is after like 17, 18 weeks. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1867.78s)]
*  They're coming at you. Yeah. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1870.76s)]
*  Yeah. They got they got there to stop throwing up. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1871.66s)]
*  They don't know hormones going. They're getting crazy. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1875.02s)]
*  So their testosterone raises while they're in there. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1877.66s)]
*  Yeah. So you take their baby bird and then they become essentially a teenager. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1880.14s)]
*  So they got that teenager. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1884.4s)]
*  And now they grow other birds for breeding purposes where they'll get real big. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1885.94s)]
*  Seventy five, 80 pounds will be less birds in there. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1889.6000000000001s)]
*  And I've never been to a farm like that. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1892.72s)]
*  I've seen them. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1895.18s)]
*  And they say that once they get over that 19, 20 week range, like 22 weeks, [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1896.02s)]
*  they their testosterone goes back down and then they like mellow back out. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1901.06s)]
*  But you're you're riding right around that 19, 18, 19 week. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1904.8000000000002s)]
*  You got a good four weeks of, you know, battling, just trying to get through there, [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1908.3400000000001s)]
*  make sure everybody's good, not not getting getting yourself tore up. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1911.7800000000002s)]
*  So, you know, it gets a little hit managed in that last month. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1915.68s)]
*  Yeah. So, I mean, I've had a guy, one of my buddies, Mark, straight [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1918.38s)]
*  got drilled in the nuts. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1922.68s)]
*  We had a I was watching him crawl out of the barn. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1923.92s)]
*  Like it took him out, took him out. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1926.5800000000002s)]
*  And you're talking about force of a 40 pound bird and it just not tagged him. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1928.8200000000002s)]
*  Perfect. He was laying on the ground. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1931.82s)]
*  He was trying to get the third bird jumping on. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1933.9399999999998s)]
*  Yeah. You kind of always get a fear like something happened. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1936.12s)]
*  You get crippled in there. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1938.62s)]
*  They probably just kill you. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1940.12s)]
*  What's a great question we got coming up right here about how many birds. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1941.6599999999999s)]
*  Yo, what up, Theo? [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1949.5s)]
*  What up, Turkey farmer? [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1950.96s)]
*  It's Alex here, Fenton, Michigan. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1952.62s)]
*  Just really got a couple quick ones for you. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1955.5s)]
*  Do the turkeys have large talons? [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1958.74s)]
*  And if they do or if they don't, [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1961.86s)]
*  how many do you think it would take to to take one of you down? [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1965.1599999999999s)]
*  Gang gang. Gang, baby. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1969.8999999999999s)]
*  Thank you, brother. Yeah. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1971.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. How many turkeys did it take really to take out a Robert Huffman man? [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1972.3999999999999s)]
*  No, probably 10,000 or so. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1976.32s)]
*  Really? I mean, unless I stroke out or something in there, they might get me. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1979.62s)]
*  But, you know, but it looked like the damage that one could cause is pretty extensive. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1982.96s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. No, they I guess it's just all in the right right way. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1987.2s)]
*  They get you. Anybody get knocked out by anybody for this part. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1990.56s)]
*  So, you know, I could be leaning over and one whacked me in the noggin. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1993.1599999999999s)]
*  And if you go out in there, that's just it's they're going to get you on the ground. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=1996.84s)]
*  So they're more. Yeah. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2001.06s)]
*  So they might go around and they're just curious. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2002.6s)]
*  So they peck. Right. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2005.56s)]
*  You know, you might say you stroke out, fall down. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2006.94s)]
*  They peck you. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2009.6s)]
*  I'd imagine if no one found you for a few hours, probably wouldn't be good. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2010.7s)]
*  Right. Straight up. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2014.06s)]
*  So you run into some real it's a really [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2017.44s)]
*  it's same as these cat ladies and shit that die with [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2020.2s)]
*  the cats and get eaten up, sitting in a chair. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2023.1599999999999s)]
*  Do we had a lady in my neighborhood growing up, they had a panther in her. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2026.1599999999999s)]
*  She had a panther living in her place. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2030.26s)]
*  Nobody everybody always thought she was crazy. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2031.8999999999999s)]
*  I was yelling about this cat outside. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2033.6s)]
*  And people were like, get back in your house, you know. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2035.7s)]
*  And she had a fucking bobcat or panther or something. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2038.36s)]
*  Had a big daddy been living in her house. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2042.26s)]
*  And she's been in there living with it for years, man. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2045.06s)]
*  And everybody's just like, you're crazy, Miss Dorothy. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2048.26s)]
*  You know, go back inside and somebody threw a surprise party by our house [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2050.5s)]
*  or something, and somebody jumped out and yelled surprise. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2056.5s)]
*  And that damn cat fucking almost killed the guy. Damn serious shit. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2058.56s)]
*  I mean, it's just you don't know, you know, you don't know really what's going on. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2063.2400000000002s)]
*  I think inside of some of these animals, that's really the tricky part for me. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2066.0s)]
*  Yeah. Is there is there a time where you get a real big one and then you're like, [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2069.44s)]
*  oh, I got to pull this one out because this one I got to use for breed. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2072.8s)]
*  And this one is goes somewhere else. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2075.64s)]
*  Does that ever happen? Or at this point, you know exactly what you're getting. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2077.2s)]
*  We're getting into the perfect genetics for the birds to create, [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2079.6s)]
*  you know, solid breast meat. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2084.3999999999996s)]
*  We're really going for a heavier bird for breast and and thigh [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2085.6s)]
*  so we can feed feed America. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2089.48s)]
*  We're trying to get back in. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2090.98s)]
*  That's why we're always revolving and just constant constant birds year round. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2093.5s)]
*  How has the meat? [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2098.64s)]
*  Damn, that's you right there. Yeah. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2099.54s)]
*  Damn, that's whether that's your first wife. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2101.64s)]
*  Yeah, this is damn beautiful. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2104.7s)]
*  Pretty good. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2106.4s)]
*  That's actually when they're going out. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2108.04s)]
*  So that's a good picture. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2109.4s)]
*  See the feed lines raised. Everything's there. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2110.34s)]
*  Lights are on. It's nighttime. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2112.1800000000003s)]
*  That's one of the heavier birds that he probably weighed close to [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2114.44s)]
*  only forty six, forty seven pounds. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2117.44s)]
*  And this is only a middle time, right? [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2119.5s)]
*  No, this is a heavy time. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2121.58s)]
*  Oh, this is heavy. That's big boys there. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2122.5s)]
*  That's that's see they got little beards, whatnot. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2124.2000000000003s)]
*  Dude, it's really they're kind of beautiful. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2127.34s)]
*  I didn't I guess I have not seen pictures like this. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2128.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, they're nice, pretty white birds and really clean. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2131.4s)]
*  Licks to the that's why we do litter quality. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2134.68s)]
*  We're in their tilling day to day operation every week. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2137.22s)]
*  We go in there with a tractor and a tiller to make sure the, [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2139.72s)]
*  you know, the shavings get brought back to the top. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2142.2599999999998s)]
*  Everything stays nice for their feet, [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2144.2799999999997s)]
*  because if you've got poor litter quality and poor, poor life, [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2146.52s)]
*  these birds won't look like that. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2149.3799999999997s)]
*  They'll be we really run down. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2150.7599999999998s)]
*  They'll have burned pads on their feet from the turkey, turkey crap. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2153.52s)]
*  It'll burn their feet. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2156.8199999999997s)]
*  So yeah, that's why we make sure everything's nice and nice and clean. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2157.68s)]
*  So they're a real sensitive animal, huh? [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2161.62s)]
*  They can be. Yeah. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2163.86s)]
*  It's interesting how they're tough and [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2165.76s)]
*  only turkeys are smart and dumb all at the same time. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2168.52s)]
*  Yes, just like me. Yeah, me too. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2171.36s)]
*  They damn I didn't know it was possible. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2173.28s)]
*  And then here we are. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2176.32s)]
*  What's something that I wouldn't expect about a turkey man? [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2180.6800000000003s)]
*  What's something that's really unique about them [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2184.0600000000004s)]
*  compared to maybe any other animals or something that really stands out about them? [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2185.86s)]
*  Because they definitely look really different. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2189.5800000000004s)]
*  They definitely they kind of seem like a peacock that's been, you know, [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2191.52s)]
*  essentially a peacock is a turkey, just just a different, [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2196.56s)]
*  you know, they're very, very similar, but they'll get hooks to they'll get spurs. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2200.2599999999998s)]
*  They just got a weirder [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2204.5s)]
*  call than a turkey does. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2207.52s)]
*  And then, oh, they're characteristics. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2208.9s)]
*  I mean, they're pretty much, you know, noble, noble animal. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2211.56s)]
*  They stick together. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2214.22s)]
*  Um. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2216.42s)]
*  I don't know, just. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2217.5s)]
*  I've been around them for so long, you know, take my I was raised, raised up in it. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2220.6s)]
*  Eighty nine. I was like five years old when my parents started it. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2224.7400000000002s)]
*  So your parents started this business. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2228.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. OK. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2229.64s)]
*  My mom and dad did it. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2230.64s)]
*  Mom worked at the bank. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2231.7s)]
*  Dad worked down the road driving heavy equipment for a company down in Northern Virginia. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2232.66s)]
*  And he would commute like two hours back and forth. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2236.9s)]
*  And we just needed to figure out a better way to to bring some money in for the farm, [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2239.66s)]
*  because the farm I actually live on Hazard Mill Farms, it's been in the family since, [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2245.9s)]
*  you know, continuously since the late 1700s. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2250.24s)]
*  And then we've been operating my great, great grandfather bought it in 1888 [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2254.56s)]
*  from another family member, and he bought a bunch of these tracks up. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2259.06s)]
*  And he owned both sides of the river. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2262.06s)]
*  Now, my other family owns the other side. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2263.74s)]
*  We got this side right on the Shenandoah River. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2265.6s)]
*  And has it always been turkeys for both sides? [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2268.86s)]
*  Or no, no, we we my parents were the side. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2271.2s)]
*  I guess I'd be a second generation turkey part. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2274.4s)]
*  But I mean, we did beef cattle. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2276.38s)]
*  My great grandfather would forge the river and bring cattle over there. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2277.88s)]
*  They did tomatoes for the Cannon Factory. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2280.84s)]
*  He was a big time farmer. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2284.08s)]
*  Granted, we were poor and lived off the land. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2286.7400000000002s)]
*  But they now I mean, I'm looking at some prime real estate [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2289.38s)]
*  that I just happened to put in the conservation easements. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2294.8s)]
*  I got worried about no development. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2297.54s)]
*  It's all bordered by national forests. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2299.1800000000003s)]
*  Right on the river. Yeah, right on the river. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2301.78s)]
*  Oh, wow. It's beautiful. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2303.3s)]
*  Yeah. So do do. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2304.4s)]
*  So you guys, at what point did you guys get out of cropping [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2308.1s)]
*  and just get into turkeys? [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2311.28s)]
*  So we were just on beef cattle. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2313.54s)]
*  My dad started started back bringing beef back on. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2315.0s)]
*  He married into the my mom's side and it's my mom, my grandmother, my aunt. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2317.9s)]
*  They own that property. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2321.58s)]
*  And, you know, he started it. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2323.28s)]
*  And then they decided, said, you can grow like I was telling you, [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2326.04s)]
*  instead of having to have 200 head of cattle, [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2329.34s)]
*  you can make the same money with two turkey barns that take up 14 acres. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2331.58s)]
*  Wow. So we're able to preserve the land [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2335.18s)]
*  to the way we want because we're more mountain land. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2338.14s)]
*  It's all up on Massadon Mountain. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2340.34s)]
*  Got some fields out there. We do hay and pasture. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2342.44s)]
*  But other than that, you know, we couldn't run [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2345.58s)]
*  the 200 head of cattle to make enough live, you know, make a living. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2349.18s)]
*  Justify it. Right. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2352.62s)]
*  Well, this is just more economical, makes more sense for you. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2353.98s)]
*  Yeah, it's still, you know, to start a new barn, start to finish right now. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2356.44s)]
*  If you're looking at you're probably looking at one point five million per barn. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2360.12s)]
*  Really start to finish and then you're not going to turn a profit until. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2362.8199999999997s)]
*  I think they're saying depending when that barn gets built, 13 months [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2367.58s)]
*  to 16 months by time your first flock and you're turning over some money. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2371.22s)]
*  So say you sell a flock, right? [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2374.88s)]
*  The market's at a decent price. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2376.34s)]
*  How I mean, can you is it can you make a decent living? [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2378.62s)]
*  I mean, I used to work on a farm or worked on soybean, corn and cotton farm [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2381.64s)]
*  in college at the end of college and at the end of high school [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2384.2799999999997s)]
*  and beginning of college. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2387.08s)]
*  And, you know, I didn't own anything, but I saw basically kind of how the living was [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2387.92s)]
*  and like how like, you know, when there was a bad crop, [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2392.2200000000003s)]
*  there was some subsidization by the government and stuff like that. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2394.6800000000003s)]
*  So at least you had a little bit of backup because you were providing like [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2397.08s)]
*  and something's and yeah, because you were providing a value to America. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2400.52s)]
*  You know, you're providing like food or whatever it was or animal food or whatever. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2404.76s)]
*  What what what is it like for you guys there with the market? [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2409.98s)]
*  Is it like what can a turkey farmer make? [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2414.46s)]
*  I'm pretty small scale compared to the other guys. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2418.28s)]
*  So like cash flow wise, you know, I'm pulling in, you know, roughly [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2421.02s)]
*  depending on the flock average, you know, you can make it 150, [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2426.12s)]
*  you know, give or take a year. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2430.6800000000003s)]
*  And that's not just on and granted, I'm still paying electric. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2433.58s)]
*  You know, some of that cost comes out, but we're kind of like a cooperative. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2436.98s)]
*  So we get we do get some dividends and stuff through it. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2440.42s)]
*  So it's not not as bad as if I would just grew for a privatized company. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2444.02s)]
*  Like you were sharecropping or something. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2448.02s)]
*  Yeah. Or if I grew for like [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2449.42s)]
*  butterball or something, right, they'll give you incentives and stuff as well [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2451.88s)]
*  if you do good for your first two years. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2455.78s)]
*  But after that, then there's no other incentive to grow for them. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2457.28s)]
*  And then you're already kind of locked in your captain at what you got. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2460.06s)]
*  And then you're like, well, do I build a couple more barns [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2462.92s)]
*  and take another chunk of investment out? [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2464.92s)]
*  So so it's one point five million to start a new barn roughly if you wanted to start one. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2466.88s)]
*  And that's and it's going to be and that's before you start to make any money to come in. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2471.7200000000003s)]
*  It'll be after your first flock is done. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2475.72s)]
*  That's three, four months. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2478.16s)]
*  Yeah. Five months. Maybe. No, no. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2479.52s)]
*  It's first flock. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2480.7599999999998s)]
*  It's it's it's like I said, 13 to 14 months. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2482.4599999999996s)]
*  You're built. You got your first flock in and it's out the door. Turn around. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2485.7799999999997s)]
*  OK. And how long is that flock coming? [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2489.12s)]
*  You said it's 19 weeks, 19 weeks, 19 weeks. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2490.68s)]
*  Yeah. OK. How much months is that? [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2492.9599999999996s)]
*  Almost five months. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2494.68s)]
*  So you can maybe do two flocks in a year, kind of. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2496.22s)]
*  Is that what you kind of go for? [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2498.02s)]
*  We got three flocks a year. You do. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2498.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, because you can overlap some. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2500.22s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Huh. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2502.2799999999997s)]
*  Do you have the idea that you want to do another barn? [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2503.86s)]
*  You think you kind of get where you're at? [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2505.6s)]
*  I'm good where I'm at. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2507.1600000000003s)]
*  I got a like I was telling him I'm moving a shut down one production side [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2508.36s)]
*  and I'm actually created Hazard Mill Selects. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2513.1s)]
*  So right now we're doing CBD. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2516.46s)]
*  We're going hemp in there. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2517.76s)]
*  And then we're Virginia just went legal for marijuana. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2518.7200000000003s)]
*  So that's my whole another step. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2522.2000000000003s)]
*  I'm getting ready to try to get one of these permits and go. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2524.26s)]
*  Dude, if you came out with a tip with that turkey THC, that shit [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2529.1200000000003s)]
*  that'll put you to sleep, boy. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2532.1s)]
*  You know what I'm saying, do? [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2533.7599999999998s)]
*  Because both those things will put me to sleep. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2534.56s)]
*  If I have a little bit of turkey or I have a dang hit on a joint or hit on it. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2536.7s)]
*  Yeah, just smell you right out. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2540.2599999999998s)]
*  Dab, you know. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2541.6s)]
*  Hell, if I even kiss some girl that's been smoking dope, I fucking go to bed. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2542.5s)]
*  But I sleep real easy. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2545.7599999999998s)]
*  And I'm real, you know, I'm saying that I don't like to rub your belly. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2547.7999999999997s)]
*  Oh, dude. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2551.16s)]
*  I see a pillow, son. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2552.7s)]
*  It's over. Yeah. You know, it's time. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2554.2s)]
*  Why does why does turkey make people go to sleep? [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2557.1s)]
*  Now, I'm not I'm not too familiar with it, [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2560.84s)]
*  but I know they release some type of endorphin or whatnot. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2564.2400000000002s)]
*  But it's supposed to. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2568.8s)]
*  It's kind of like a melatonin you get from it. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2571.4s)]
*  Do turkeys sleep a lot? [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2573.9s)]
*  Do they have it because it's in them, I guess? [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2575.2000000000003s)]
*  Well, they'll they'll kind of get in that nesting when, you know, lights go out for them. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2577.56s)]
*  They'll they'll get their downtime and they'll kind of rubble up. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2580.9s)]
*  And that's when they're all together. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2584.3s)]
*  They kind of just like to stick together and you'll see see them all [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2585.9s)]
*  like wing to wing, just chilling out and the nuzzle down. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2589.54s)]
*  They'll take the fresh shavings, kick it over and then just kind of snuggle up. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2592.6s)]
*  Kind of like lions or something. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2596.24s)]
*  If you see a pride of lions out there. Yeah. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2597.3s)]
*  Now, what are turkeys like different in the wild? [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2602.04s)]
*  So do you turkey hunt also? Yeah. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2604.04s)]
*  Yeah. I'm an avid hunter, fisherman, outdoorsman. Yeah. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2605.74s)]
*  Pretty much the same, except for that. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2610.7599999999998s)]
*  They're able to they're not as heavy, so they'll fly out and roost every night. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2613.64s)]
*  So they'll do the same thing, but they'll roost in trees together. OK. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2617.5s)]
*  How high can a turkey get up in a tree? [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2622.0s)]
*  I've seen them up in pine trees, 20, 20 to 30 feet. No way. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2624.96s)]
*  Then they'll come off that roost and just glide. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2628.52s)]
*  I mean, if they're off off a canyon or a little cliff style, [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2630.86s)]
*  they'll just glide over and go like three or 400 yards and then just move. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2633.76s)]
*  And then they start doing doing turkey things, start pecking [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2638.1s)]
*  and looking for food and scratching around. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2641.16s)]
*  I've actually had turkeys come up to my barns [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2643.66s)]
*  and get them riled up where they're gobbling back and forth at each other [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2646.48s)]
*  during springtime. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2649.52s)]
*  They'll be outside like, what's up? [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2650.98s)]
*  And then they just start going back and forth. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2652.48s)]
*  And who fights more, the males or female turkeys? [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2654.58s)]
*  The males. Yeah. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2657.74s)]
*  Females, you know, other than if something's trying to get after their babies, [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2658.98s)]
*  they generally. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2662.78s)]
*  In the wild, they don't. Right. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2665.14s)]
*  Yeah. What keeps them from mating when they're in [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2666.68s)]
*  y'all's containment over there? [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2670.28s)]
*  I think it's just because they're not technically a mature bird. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2673.3999999999996s)]
*  Oh, so they're not even at what age do they start to mate? [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2676.2599999999998s)]
*  Like right about right when they're getting ready to go out. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2679.6s)]
*  So they don't really, you know. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2681.8599999999997s)]
*  So a lot of them are never going to see fatherhood, really. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2684.2999999999997s)]
*  No, no, well, they just get there, you know, do their job and. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2686.3599999999997s)]
*  You know, feed America. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2692.5s)]
*  It's dinner time. Everybody. I mean, it's. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2693.4599999999996s)]
*  Is there a lot of pushback on the industry? [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2698.2s)]
*  No, not I wouldn't say for. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2700.7599999999998s)]
*  It's such a staple. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2702.56s)]
*  See, turkeys, you know, we're not like chicken companies. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2704.16s)]
*  So, you know, there were a little more of a niche market compared to like Purdue [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2706.64s)]
*  for their chickens, because, you know, you're not seeing turkey [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2710.04s)]
*  chicken nuggets, you see turkey nuggets inside. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2712.74s)]
*  So the demand is so high for chicken that they have have a larger turnaround. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2715.24s)]
*  And then there, you know, there's instances where that you see some [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2719.8399999999997s)]
*  some bad stuff that happens on farm with other workers and stuff like that. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2722.8399999999997s)]
*  But how did how did y'all lose that battle? [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2726.2999999999997s)]
*  Was there like a battle where it was like chicken or turkey was going to be [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2729.06s)]
*  the excited, the one the new the thing, you know? [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2732.2799999999997s)]
*  I don't know, man. They've been growing. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2735.88s)]
*  Turkey since like the 50s and 60s in the Shenandoah Valley, where I'm from. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2739.08s)]
*  And I don't think it was ever. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2742.82s)]
*  I guess it was something back in the day, because I guess turkeys got stapled [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2746.62s)]
*  as the Thanksgiving, you know, niche. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2749.72s)]
*  And then you think, I'm only turkey once a year, maybe Christmas. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2752.36s)]
*  You know, yeah. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2756.16s)]
*  So you're like, OK, I eat my turkey and then just eat chicken the rest of the time. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2757.0s)]
*  Yeah. So I think maybe we kind of got ourselves put into the [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2760.9s)]
*  first Thanksgiving put us there. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2765.14s)]
*  Yeah. People get tired. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2766.9s)]
*  They eat that big meal. You get tired and you're like, [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2768.08s)]
*  oh, I'm good on turkey for a while. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2769.9s)]
*  Yeah. Maybe that's part of it, too. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2771.94s)]
*  Maybe turkey has that thing where it's like, I'm going to. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2773.38s)]
*  I'm a holiday. Yeah. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2776.3s)]
*  I think it's true. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2778.98s)]
*  It's like it's been romanticized kind of in culture as, yeah, like a holiday meat. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2779.84s)]
*  Special like. Yeah. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2783.98s)]
*  It's a fancy thing. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2785.6s)]
*  You would see rich people like at a thing and they got a big [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2786.64s)]
*  plaque or something they're eating off of and they're, you know, [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2790.14s)]
*  you know, somebody's rich and the kids on pills or whatever, but he's still [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2792.7799999999997s)]
*  like, it's always, you know, like the Norman Rockwell or something. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2797.18s)]
*  You'd see those pictures and I think it makes you feel turkey. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2800.08s)]
*  A full size pig with an apple stuck in. Yeah. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2803.18s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. King's table at King's law. Yeah. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2805.84s)]
*  Yeah. You would see that. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2808.84s)]
*  You're like, oh, man, this is a fancy turkey leg. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2809.68s)]
*  Oh, somebody. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2812.24s)]
*  Here's a question that came in right here from Christopher right here. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2815.64s)]
*  Let's get to it. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2818.14s)]
*  Hey, Theo, Mr. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2819.9s)]
*  Turkey farmer. This is Chris from down in Sydney, Australia. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2821.2799999999997s)]
*  Rise up lights. Rise up lights. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2824.98s)]
*  I was just wondering, I'm a big fan of turkey. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2829.7s)]
*  I think it's a great meat. It's nourishing. It's lean. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2832.88s)]
*  And I just wondered why you don't see it on more fast food chains [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2836.6s)]
*  like at McDonald's or KFC, because, you know, I'd love to have a Mcgobble [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2839.7s)]
*  gobble. No homo. Yeah, that's good. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2843.84s)]
*  Yeah. But yeah, that's my question. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2846.6600000000003s)]
*  Why don't you see turkey on more fast food menus? [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2848.4s)]
*  Because it's a great, great meat. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2851.3s)]
*  Yeah, it is. Gang, baby. Thank you, bro. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2852.96s)]
*  And rise up lights. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2856.46s)]
*  If you say razor, if you say rise up lights, rise up lights a couple times. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2857.76s)]
*  It sounds like razor blades in Australian. OK. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2863.94s)]
*  Rise up lights. You just taught me something. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2867.6400000000003s)]
*  You try it. It's right. Rise up lights. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2870.0s)]
*  Rise up lights. Rise up lights. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2874.0s)]
*  Yeah, it sounds like razor blades. Razor. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2875.5s)]
*  So anyway, just good icebreaker. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2877.76s)]
*  Good to, you know, keep the wife warm with that one. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2879.7400000000002s)]
*  But that's a great question. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2884.26s)]
*  Yeah. How does it why isn't it? [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2885.1400000000003s)]
*  Do you think it's headed that way? [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2886.8s)]
*  Well, first start, why isn't it? [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2888.5s)]
*  Why isn't Turkey more that thing? [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2889.8s)]
*  Now, you do see it at like a Jimmy John's. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2891.3s)]
*  You do see it at a Subways. You see it at Arby's. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2893.34s)]
*  So you're seeing like a lot of them. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2897.5s)]
*  It's going to be like the sliced turkey. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2899.6000000000004s)]
*  So that's something that we would probably sell, [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2901.2599999999998s)]
*  like a product where they're getting that breast meat to the masses. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2903.2599999999998s)]
*  I'd love to see like a turkey tender instead of a chicken tender. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2907.04s)]
*  I just think the market for it to be sustainable like that. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2911.8599999999997s)]
*  The reason you haven't seen the turkeys go hard, [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2915.14s)]
*  it's just really just that we don't have that type of [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2918.8599999999997s)]
*  that many farmers out there to actually be able to consistently sustain [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2924.2s)]
*  that that demand at the moment. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2927.7s)]
*  So it's kind of like we go all in and then [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2929.82s)]
*  say you guys don't end up wanting to, you know, turkey nuggets or whatnot. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2932.6200000000003s)]
*  And then then you got like a lot of farmers [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2936.26s)]
*  don't invest it, you know, two, three million dollars in this stuff. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2939.5s)]
*  And then they're out out on the streets again. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2942.2200000000003s)]
*  You almost need a different height, man. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2945.2000000000003s)]
*  You need it like a big PR thing. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2947.02s)]
*  You know, be like turkey is that thing. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2948.5s)]
*  It's like because you see us at Panera Bread. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2950.42s)]
*  That's another big comp. Oh, yeah. Yeah. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2952.8s)]
*  Yeah, it's interesting. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2955.92s)]
*  I hadn't really thought like it's only turkeys often sliced [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2956.82s)]
*  or you'll see it at like a Boston market or something like that. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2959.7400000000002s)]
*  Sometimes a place where they do more of a meal. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2962.48s)]
*  I think it's regarded as more of a meal and not as much of a. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2965.1200000000003s)]
*  I don't want to say like a cheap eat, but because I love turkey burgers. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2970.42s)]
*  Turkey burgers is something that I love. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2973.98s)]
*  It's great, man. So and maybe some of it's growing over time. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2976.1800000000003s)]
*  Do you know if the market is growing over time? [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2980.04s)]
*  It has compared. I mean, you're going from, you know, [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2982.48s)]
*  when my parents started in 89, I know I know they've had some attempts. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2985.28s)]
*  Niche markets where they push it. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2989.1000000000004s)]
*  But now, since people are more wanting to know what they put in their body, [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2991.1800000000003s)]
*  like you were saying, people want that lean protein from that turkey. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2995.48s)]
*  And it's different than chicken. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2998.4s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's if not better. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=2999.7400000000002s)]
*  I mean, you barbecue up a couple [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3001.98s)]

*  What I feel it's Carl here in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3251.44s)]
*  Shout out, Nick. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3254.16s)]
*  I have a quick question for your turkey farmer. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3255.74s)]
*  What does he eat on Thanksgiving? [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3258.8599999999997s)]
*  Because for me, if I was processing all those birds [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3262.16s)]
*  and getting ready for this Thanksgiving rush, I'd be so over it. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3265.2599999999998s)]
*  I'd be like, no, we're going to get some steaks. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3268.8399999999997s)]
*  We're going to get some ham or something, something else. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3270.84s)]
*  So what does he do? [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3274.5s)]
*  And then if he is turkey, then what's his favorite side? [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3275.4s)]
*  Because obviously the birdman is going to know the best side to go with some turkey. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3278.0s)]
*  So I'm looking for some suggestions. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3281.6400000000003s)]
*  Appreciate you. Gang gang. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3283.2000000000003s)]
*  That birdman. Yeah. What's the what is it? [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3285.36s)]
*  What's the choice from the captain himself? [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3287.6000000000004s)]
*  What is it? [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3289.76s)]
*  You know, I always joke around with the guys with the company. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3291.3s)]
*  We eat one of our turkeys every year. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3293.9s)]
*  So like just before I come here, one of my guys from the company, [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3295.44s)]
*  we kill our own birds and then we keep keep our turkey birds [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3298.76s)]
*  and we give everybody in the company a free turkey. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3302.42s)]
*  OK. But with that being said, I mean, I've been lobbying to to get some ham, [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3305.2200000000003s)]
*  maybe partner up with a pig company or exchange or something. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3310.5200000000004s)]
*  Yeah, you all do. Is there any dark you sneaking over there at night [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3315.88s)]
*  across the freaking pig pen or what? Is there any? [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3318.36s)]
*  No, no, it's none of that. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3320.96s)]
*  But do you choose? So for Thanksgiving, you guys have turkey. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3323.1600000000003s)]
*  Yes. I mean, I cook a lot. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3325.56s)]
*  I'm, you know, borderline chef, wife's chef. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3327.42s)]
*  But we we do the I do a nice infrared. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3330.32s)]
*  So I don't deep fry, but I put them in that infrared [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3334.16s)]
*  and it gets that crispiness just like a deep fried bird without all that oil. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3336.46s)]
*  Really? Is that the new thing? [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3339.7799999999997s)]
*  It's delicious. Is it? Yeah. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3341.56s)]
*  Because I grew up on that turducken, man. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3343.42s)]
*  And even I answered that we had damn turditos. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3344.98s)]
*  I remember it's like a turkey and a duck. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3348.2799999999997s)]
*  And then they fill it with Cheetos. I remember. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3350.2799999999997s)]
*  And I'm like, what is this shit? [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3352.86s)]
*  You know, I'm saying the head damn everything. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3354.16s)]
*  Spicy Cheetos or regular Cheetos? [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3355.56s)]
*  I think it was. I couldn't tell. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3357.68s)]
*  I think it was regular. OK. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3359.58s)]
*  Yeah, because we nobody in our area ate those jalapeno Cheetos. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3361.3799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it was more that they didn't even have the hot ones at that point. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3364.98s)]
*  It was just they were still doing the regular Cheeto, you know. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3367.8199999999997s)]
*  So mature. But that third item now, did that turducken? [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3371.56s)]
*  Did that ever hit you? Do you guys have to do that? [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3374.52s)]
*  No, no, I'm never. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3376.92s)]
*  I mean, I've bought a turducken. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3378.68s)]
*  You believe in all that? It's not. It's OK. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3380.3599999999997s)]
*  It's just a lot going on. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3382.58s)]
*  You got the turkey and chicken and all that stuff stuffed in there. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3384.52s)]
*  Sometimes I've seen them stuff a quail in that thing. Yeah. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3388.18s)]
*  Or I've seen a turala, turala, deep or whatever it is, turala, deep. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3391.24s)]
*  It's turkey alligator and then sheep meat in it. Oh. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3396.42s)]
*  And I'm like, what? [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3400.58s)]
*  At some point, people are just damn. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3401.72s)]
*  This is a damn gangbang. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3403.84s)]
*  I feel like, you know what I'm saying? Like, that's a little too much. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3405.34s)]
*  I feel like if you get those all those meats and just cook them [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3407.68s)]
*  primarily alone, you still do your own mix. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3410.9s)]
*  Yeah, you could mix it on your plate. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3414.08s)]
*  Like, why do you have to I feel like they get it robs flavor from one or the other. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3415.54s)]
*  That's a lot of trial and error there. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3419.78s)]
*  Now, I like I like my turkey. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3423.04s)]
*  I like to do it, you know, in that infrared deep fryer style. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3424.3s)]
*  Oil is fryer, whatever you want to call it. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3428.3s)]
*  I've never had that that song. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3430.5s)]
*  It's almost like a song. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3431.98s)]
*  So it's it's propane. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3433.44s)]
*  And then it's like one of those smokeless fire pits, you know. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3435.38s)]
*  So now the smoke comes up and it's like a tube and you drop the turkey [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3439.5s)]
*  and just like a fryer and the heat just goes around it. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3442.62s)]
*  And they crisp it up just perfect. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3445.42s)]
*  Oh, damn. Yeah. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3446.82s)]
*  Like that thing's in Barbados or something. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3448.42s)]
*  I like to inject it with some marinades, get it juicy. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3450.3s)]
*  Do you guys also have you ever thought of getting into that market [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3453.36s)]
*  or that's not really your market to get into like a marinate? [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3455.72s)]
*  Because I guess you don't have that storefront. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3458.96s)]
*  I right now do not have the storefront. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3460.8s)]
*  Eventually, you know, hazard bill farms itself. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3463.12s)]
*  You know, we're planning to put in probably some grapes to a winery. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3466.12s)]
*  I wanted to infuse some CBD into my wine tasting room. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3470.58s)]
*  I got an events barn down there on the river. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3475.08s)]
*  We've been doing some events. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3476.98s)]
*  Oh, no. And stuff. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3478.02s)]
*  Yeah, I'm curious. You sound like you have like a do you feel like [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3479.56s)]
*  you want it to be a turkey farmer? [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3482.86s)]
*  Do you feel like you want it to be an entrepreneur? [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3484.2200000000003s)]
*  Like, where do you kind of feel like some of your sense [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3486.16s)]
*  to do to be a businessman came from? [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3489.02s)]
*  Just just being able to diversify. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3491.52s)]
*  And my major push is to save small farms, be creative and then give back. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3493.88s)]
*  So entrepreneurship was, you know, all on me sitting around. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3500.78s)]
*  I want to be creative. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3504.48s)]
*  So my daughter doesn't have to sell the property. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3505.42s)]
*  Or I think the death of small farms is really where the mom and dad starts to farm. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3507.78s)]
*  We can't afford to live off them. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3513.94s)]
*  We go get a job. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3515.6400000000003s)]
*  Then we end up getting our own career. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3516.54s)]
*  So they just never really come back to the farm until mom and dad dies. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3518.28s)]
*  And then, boom, they're selling it. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3521.5800000000004s)]
*  And then they're selling it because their interest is gone. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3522.92s)]
*  So yeah, it's interesting how we do that, huh? [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3524.78s)]
*  Yes, I'm here to, you know, that's why I came to chat. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3527.7400000000002s)]
*  I mean, I'm really I'm on sixth district is the congressional district I'm in. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3531.48s)]
*  I'm on the Ag Advisory Committee for Congressman Klein. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3537.08s)]
*  OK, and and that's in Virginia. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3541.08s)]
*  Yeah, that's in Virginia. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3542.6800000000003s)]
*  So really bad props to Ben Klein, good friend of mine. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3544.04s)]
*  He really wants to know what's every niche. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3547.64s)]
*  He wants to know what's good for dairy for his district. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3549.7200000000003s)]
*  What's good for poultry? [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3552.38s)]
*  You know, he he doesn't know much about it because, you know, he was an attorney, [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3554.48s)]
*  Commonwealth attorney, and then got got the congressional spot there a few years back. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3558.3s)]
*  So, I mean, just I give him bad props. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3563.84s)]
*  He's going out trying to find us like minded farmers to meet and then help him out. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3565.44s)]
*  What do we need? How we can do better and how how can we save these farms [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3569.58s)]
*  and keep keep us rocking? [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3573.3s)]
*  Wow. And what's the biggest threat to the small farms? [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3574.88s)]
*  Um, subdivisions and development. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3578.94s)]
*  Oh, really? Yeah. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3582.3799999999997s)]
*  Oh, I guess. Oh, now you said that you had that conservative ship now. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3583.3799999999997s)]
*  A conservatorship. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3585.7999999999997s)]
*  I got a conservation easement. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3587.48s)]
*  Yeah, with VCC Virginia Council [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3590.14s)]
*  out of Stanton, Virginia. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3593.8799999999997s)]
*  So your land will be safe now, so they can't develop with. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3595.6s)]
*  So even if it's sold, they would have to buy that thing in a large track [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3597.74s)]
*  and there's no commercial nor housing can be developed. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3601.44s)]
*  Wow. If anything did happen. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3604.5s)]
*  Yeah, you know, it's interesting because I had on a guy who does small game. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3606.74s)]
*  He does like if you got something in your house, it's not your wife or kid. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3609.9399999999996s)]
*  And it should. But it's trying to, you know, yeah, be alive. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3613.06s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? That midsize animal control man. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3616.4599999999996s)]
*  Yeah, this fella. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3618.56s)]
*  And he said that a lot of times you find raccoons in your house. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3620.2999999999997s)]
*  You find this and he goes, it's because he's like, they don't know what your house, dude. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3623.8599999999997s)]
*  They're not like robbers or burglars or, you know, like they're not like the wet bandits. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3627.74s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? Like they are just they think it's a tree. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3631.9399999999996s)]
*  Like their trees have all been torn down and shit. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3634.7s)]
*  So they're just climbing into whatever seems like it's close to that. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3636.9399999999996s)]
*  So it's interesting when we start to really give up our nature. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3640.4399999999996s)]
*  I think a lot of it goes to to we get so stuck inside of ourselves. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3646.12s)]
*  Like I was going for a jog this morning. Beautiful out there, man. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3648.9199999999996s)]
*  And that's the place where I've seen the wild turkeys. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3652.22s)]
*  They just have them out there and like you see them gobbling and some of them. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3653.8799999999997s)]
*  There'll be a little crew of them. Pretty cool. Just to just to run right. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3656.96s)]
*  I mean, you're probably 15, 20 feet and sometimes they run off. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3660.12s)]
*  Sometimes they be a little curious. But so it's like but it's I'm sometimes [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3663.6s)]
*  I'm so in my head the whole time I'm running. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3668.94s)]
*  I'm barely even seeing that I'm in like a damn beautiful place. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3670.7999999999997s)]
*  You know, I mean, it's stunning. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3674.6s)]
*  So I'm missing all of the I'm missing all of the nature. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3675.88s)]
*  I think a lot of that that kind of stuff happens because we just don't [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3680.68s)]
*  we don't value it anymore. We don't even see it. Yeah. You know. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3683.64s)]
*  Anyway, that's a long diatribe for me. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3688.2599999999998s)]
*  But so so one of the big biggest problems is people coming along [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3690.58s)]
*  and just building stuff. Yeah. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3693.68s)]
*  Yeah. So like I said, as soon as that family lose interest [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3695.66s)]
*  and you can't blame the kid that went out and started a nice career somewhere else. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3698.56s)]
*  I get it. But if we're able to diversify, agritourism is huge for us right now. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3702.66s)]
*  That's kind of what I'm what I'm doing with the I want to do the grapes, the wine, [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3708.7999999999997s)]
*  CBD, eventually cannabis. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3712.64s)]
*  You know, I just want to be able to have a good living. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3715.18s)]
*  The wedding venue and events venue that I'm doing right now, [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3718.18s)]
*  it's been a big hit. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3720.98s)]
*  Done a lot of charity work this past year with it. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3722.04s)]
*  So it's give back to the community why we, you know, try to preserve [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3724.72s)]
*  this beautiful piece of track of land I got and [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3729.22s)]
*  just that whole valley. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3733.2599999999998s)]
*  I'm very fortunate not only my property, I mean, we we have a whole corridor [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3734.72s)]
*  on that river that's all under conservation easement now on the Shenandoah Valley. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3738.36s)]
*  Can you bring that up? Yeah. South Fork of the Shenandoah River. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3741.66s)]
*  And I think it's interesting that [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3745.36s)]
*  you know, because it is interesting if you're doing events and [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3748.58s)]
*  when I saw those pictures of the white [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3751.32s)]
*  and you show me the picture of you in there with those white birds. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3753.32s)]
*  Yeah, it's funny. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3756.2599999999998s)]
*  It really changed a lot of my perception of what I was even talking about [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3757.2599999999998s)]
*  because I just don't have any idea. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3762.32s)]
*  A lot of people have you have no idea. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3763.44s)]
*  Yeah, you don't you don't know the market. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3765.2599999999998s)]
*  It's not a very you've never seen anything. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3767.1s)]
*  Yeah, that's me right there. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3769.7999999999997s)]
*  Shenandoah River. Oh, that's beautiful, man. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3771.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, we got the that's that's a view from Andy Gets. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3774.34s)]
*  Go down a little bit that right there. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3777.4s)]
*  Shenandoah State Park. That's to the middle. Yeah. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3779.3s)]
*  So that's a view back going toward my mountain. OK. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3782.6s)]
*  That's my family across the river. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3785.78s)]
*  They're my great uncle put that and sold that to the state park [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3788.44s)]
*  to save it from being developed. Wow. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3791.84s)]
*  So it's Andy Gets State Park. It's really. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3793.62s)]
*  I mean, I'm not trying to be biased, [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3796.62s)]
*  but I think we have probably the prettiest stretch of river in the whole valley. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3798.62s)]
*  But it goes all the way up to Page and Leray [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3801.76s)]
*  and they'll it'll run all the way to Harper's Ferry. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3804.6600000000003s)]
*  All the way up to in Tennessee. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3806.92s)]
*  West Virginia, Harper's Ferry. Oh, wow. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3808.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. Flows north. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3810.46s)]
*  So go all the way down and dump into Potomac. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3811.6600000000003s)]
*  So Front Royal, they'll run in. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3813.86s)]
*  That's our town we live in. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3815.56s)]
*  North and South meet. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3816.86s)]
*  And then that Shenandoah River becomes one. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3818.5s)]
*  The John Denver stuff. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3820.7000000000003s)]
*  Then you'll go on down and it'll join in. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3822.5s)]
*  Harper's Ferry and dump into the Potomac. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3824.3s)]
*  Wow. Just we did a set of show. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3826.2400000000002s)]
*  We still on the Potomac. I never knew what it was. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3827.88s)]
*  I mean, I knew about it. Yeah. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3830.04s)]
*  But it's yeah, it's just funny. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3831.78s)]
*  We just I mean, I don't know. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3834.6800000000003s)]
*  And I'll say we but I need to see more nature [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3836.7s)]
*  so that it becomes a, you know, more common understanding. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3839.0s)]
*  Anytime you want to come out, take you fishing. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3841.8999999999996s)]
*  I see you caught smallmouth there a while back. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3843.44s)]
*  Oh, yeah, dude. Barely caught it. Jesus. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3845.64s)]
*  You got it in, man. But it was pretty cool. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3848.8799999999997s)]
*  We were catching the minnows. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3850.3399999999997s)]
*  Minnows. Yeah. Literally, I did like we had like one of those nets. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3852.3799999999997s)]
*  You throw it, you know, it was so cool. I'd never done it. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3855.02s)]
*  So then you get it on the thing and then you put it in this other thing [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3858.16s)]
*  in this other area where the water is water. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3861.62s)]
*  And then next thing you know, you get a oh, dude, they were like hammering it. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3864.28s)]
*  But after about 32 minutes, 31 minutes, they quit. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3868.82s)]
*  I think that word got out. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3872.6200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. You got so many in one hole. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3874.42s)]
*  They get gigs get up. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3877.2200000000003s)]
*  But yeah, anytime you come on out to the river, man, we'll take you up. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3878.5600000000004s)]
*  What's the city that's near you guys? [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3882.8s)]
*  So Front Royal, Lou Ray, that's kind of rural front row [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3884.6600000000003s)]
*  where the gateway is Skyline Drive. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3888.44s)]
*  And that's the start. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3890.54s)]
*  And Skyline Drive will go all the way down to Stanton. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3891.6s)]
*  And it turns into the Blue Ridge Parkway, goes North Carolina. OK. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3895.0s)]
*  But Winchester, I know you probably heard of Winchester. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3899.04s)]
*  Winchester, Virginia. Yeah. No. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3901.7799999999997s)]
*  So that's the next one up. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3903.52s)]
*  And then we're only like 70 miles from D.C. OK. Yeah. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3905.02s)]
*  Yeah, man, I wouldn't mind coming to check out the turkey farm, [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3909.56s)]
*  maybe on a tour whenever we do D.C. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3912.2599999999998s)]
*  we could set it up because we just went to Richmond. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3915.92s)]
*  But I'm sure we'll go somewhere else. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3919.1s)]
*  But yeah, it's just funny, man, until I saw that picture of you with those, [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3922.44s)]
*  but I'm like, I didn't even know they looked like this. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3925.28s)]
*  I don't have a real perception of something. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3927.2000000000003s)]
*  What's another question that came in? [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3930.78s)]
*  Here for Robert Spence. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3934.34s)]
*  Oh, shoot. Got to turn that around. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3938.06s)]
*  What up, Theo? What up, Turkey Killer? [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3941.28s)]
*  I know Theo, you know, he believes in it. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3944.42s)]
*  And so people like to debate it. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3946.82s)]
*  But I want to know if there's ever been a turkey with that DS, [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3950.1600000000003s)]
*  you know, seen one with one eye open or cross-eyed or whatever. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3954.6000000000004s)]
*  Curious to see if you ever seen one and do those kind of get kicked out [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3960.3s)]
*  from the rest of the group as far as what gets put on Thanksgiving [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3963.6800000000003s)]
*  dinner table or what? [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3968.02s)]
*  Let me know. All right. Gang gang turkey hitter. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3970.6800000000003s)]
*  Gang, baby. Yeah. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3974.28s)]
*  Do turkeys get diseases like humans? [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3975.34s)]
*  Do they get Down syndrome? [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3977.2400000000002s)]
*  They'll have some modified genetics every once while, like a crooked foot or, [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3978.6800000000003s)]
*  you know, just like a droopy neck or it's not so much like [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3982.32s)]
*  what we call it, like Down syndrome. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3987.26s)]
*  I just think it's, you know, they're born with some type of disability. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3988.76s)]
*  And usually they get called out. Just. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3992.2000000000003s)]
*  That's nature. Yeah, man. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3997.26s)]
*  You either you don't want that bird to suffer in it. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=3998.4s)]
*  It's like I said, depending on the bird. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4000.96s)]
*  Like one guy asked if we ever kind of keep them. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4003.16s)]
*  I do have like a holding pen to help birds to heal back up. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4005.7000000000003s)]
*  And if they can make it, they can. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4009.5s)]
*  That way they're not in general population. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4011.64s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. Kind of. Yeah. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4013.64s)]
*  Yeah. Get them out of jail. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4015.5s)]
*  Put them in that solitary. But. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4016.94s)]
*  But now we're we're just trying to run a healthy, successful business, hopefully. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4020.18s)]
*  And but yeah, they just get cold, man. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4025.42s)]
*  Some sometimes a dog eat world out there. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4028.02s)]
*  Yeah, it's and well, it's funny how we get to the point [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4030.26s)]
*  where we romanticize nature as if it's going to do this beautiful thing for itself. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4033.04s)]
*  That once we become involved, that like, oh, well, [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4039.2799999999997s)]
*  of course, sometimes we're using animals for food, of course. But. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4043.9199999999996s)]
*  Yeah. But also, it's like, you know, [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4047.12s)]
*  like a raccoon will kill its children, a raccoon, a man raccoon [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4050.8599999999997s)]
*  will kill a female raccoon's children just so she'll go back in the heat [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4055.9599999999996s)]

*  on the spot, you know, you got to make that call and not even second guess. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4072.6000000000004s)]
*  I mean, you can't talk the same stuff about how, you know, cruel the hunting, [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4076.2200000000003s)]
*  you know, the nature is compared to hunting. And it's true. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4081.54s)]
*  I mean, you you're able to, you know, arrow that that animal or, [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4084.26s)]
*  you know, shoot that animal at a good ethical shot. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4088.62s)]
*  And you're able to harvest that meat with, you know, minimum damage where [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4092.46s)]
*  you watch a wilder beast or whatever out there getting eaten by a lion [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4096.0599999999995s)]
*  while he's just sitting there with a broken back holler and same with the bears. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4099.58s)]
*  And it's just. Yeah, they're not doing it. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4103.18s)]
*  I think it's like they're inviting them to a damn holiday and they eat them [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4105.1s)]
*  while they're still alive. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4108.0599999999995s)]
*  It's like, man, come on. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4109.7s)]

*  Oh, that whole world is interesting. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4113.1s)]
*  You know, we had the guy, Jimmy John, who John Leotow, who who ran the Jimmy, [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4114.54s)]
*  who created the Jimmy Johns Company, right? [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4119.86s)]
*  And we were talking a little bit. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4121.42s)]
*  He's a big game hunter. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4123.06s)]
*  And but what some people don't know is that you pay sometimes exorbitant fees [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4124.1s)]
*  to go hunt like a specific animal and then the fee will [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4128.5s)]
*  pay for like the yeah, will pay for like local school. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4133.5s)]
*  I mean, especially like when you're in Africa, some of these other countries, [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4137.1s)]
*  like you're paying for like you're going to really keep that economy alive. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4139.66s)]
*  And it provides that food for that that community. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4143.14s)]
*  I mean, yeah, there's tons of things that go into that. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4145.620000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. The food. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4147.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Conservation is key because they they have those villagers come. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4149.34s)]
*  And actually, I have a friend that's South African and they, you know, [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4153.22s)]
*  his family had a hunting preserve. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4156.14s)]
*  He moved to my town. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4157.740000000001s)]
*  But same thing, man. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4158.740000000001s)]
*  They're they're there to feed the village. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4160.34s)]
*  And they got like 100 little they watch out for poachers. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4162.26s)]
*  They'll notify the oh, yeah, you know, they're there to snitch on these, [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4166.34s)]
*  you know, awful people that are poachers and. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4170.1s)]
*  You know, that's their livelihood. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4173.34s)]
*  Yes, it's their food. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4175.22s)]
*  That's what keeps them surviving. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4176.580000000001s)]
*  Yes. So it's interesting. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4178.5s)]
*  It's like Wendy. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4179.660000000001s)]
*  It's like, yeah, what is you like? [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4180.700000000001s)]
*  That whole line is very interesting. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4183.860000000001s)]
*  Do you feel like turkeys seem like a regular pet? [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4186.780000000001s)]
*  Do they seem like a dog? [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4189.9800000000005s)]
*  Do they seem like they have that kind of thing in them? [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4191.3s)]
*  Or do they seem more distant and more like just a snack? [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4193.620000000001s)]
*  I mean, there's a there's a fine balance. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4200.18s)]
*  If you. I don't care if that you had two turkeys by theirself [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4201.78s)]
*  in a pen that you farm raised, you're they can kind of, you know, [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4206.219999999999s)]
*  they can get to a point where they're kind of a little bit nicer. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4209.7s)]
*  But like I said, the people that are raising turkeys, small, small range [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4213.0599999999995s)]
*  and backyard at a point at that 18 to 19 old range, [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4216.98s)]
*  they're still going to be asshole. Right. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4222.179999999999s)]
*  But like I said, as they get older, that stuff goes away. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4224.0599999999995s)]
*  They'll mellow out. Right. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4226.5s)]
*  And I've seen turkeys that are pretty chilled and cool. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4228.259999999999s)]
*  And then I've seen turkeys that are, you know, it's probably just like human [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4231.14s)]
*  nature, you know, some of us are chilled and others are complete dicks. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4233.9s)]
*  Oh, dude. Most. I mean, when I was 16 years old, I was probably deserved to die. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4238.26s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, if I'm really saying the same thing, everybody I know did. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4241.98s)]
*  What's the personal life like over there? [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4246.9s)]
*  You got a spouse, a sea butcher, beautiful wife here today. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4248.38s)]

*  You got when y'all were at what age were you? [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4256.78s)]
*  Oh, I think I was mid 20s by then. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4259.54s)]
*  So yeah, I think we've been together for about eight years. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4262.46s)]
*  So what's a nice run on? [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4266.820000000001s)]
*  How's it been when you give my thumbs up so far? [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4269.42s)]
*  She puts up with me. Yeah, she. Yeah, she's a good girl. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4271.38s)]
*  Did she want to be a entrepreneur? [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4274.38s)]
*  Does she have a business side or is that? Yeah. Yeah. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4276.38s)]

*  We got together. I built her a food truck. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4285.06s)]
*  She was cheffing up some some quality food, a couple of wineries. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4287.9800000000005s)]
*  We do some big events like Cycle Virginia, where there's like [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4291.18s)]

*  And so that's a small business. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4322.66s)]
*  And that's what kind of stuff would you get from there? [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4324.3s)]

*  Yeah. Yeah. So it's no for kids. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4338.26s)]
*  I'm sure she would make something for some animals, some dogs and cats. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4340.46s)]
*  But she's got her template done and she'll do from babies up to toddlers. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4343.42s)]
*  So it's kind of like that. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4348.86s)]
*  I don't know if you ever heard of rags, but that's kind of kind of like a kids [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4350.7s)]

*  and getting some children. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4360.58s)]

*  where there's a little less liquor in. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4372.62s)]
*  Well, you're good over here. You probably get you a suburbian. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4374.18s)]
*  I got to. Yeah, maybe one with more antibiotics in it. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4377.0199999999995s)]

*  you definitely find it. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4391.099999999999s)]
*  You definitely find more of like kind of a home. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4392.18s)]
*  I don't want to say homemaker type, but people that there's people [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4393.98s)]
*  that's more family centric, I think here. Yeah. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4396.74s)]
*  And like Los Angeles there, it's a little bit more work centric. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4399.82s)]
*  And it's hard to have a family because everybody kind of [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4402.58s)]
*  that's part of the family, but it's hard to have like a space. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4405.3s)]
*  Yeah. For a family to really like breathe. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4408.22s)]

*  Same with me. She keeps my my books in order. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4420.58s)]
*  So I don't have to thank as much. Yeah. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4423.62s)]
*  On that I feel you taxes taxes are the devil. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4426.82s)]
*  I think it's the devil. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4430.46s)]
*  That's trouble. Yeah, it is trouble, man. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4434.0199999999995s)]
*  And what's the biggest threat in the turkey crops every year? [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4436.94s)]
*  Just just the unknown avian flu or some lightning or something. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4441.139999999999s)]
*  No, lightning is not a big deal. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4446.139999999999s)]
*  No, we're good. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4448.3s)]
*  That I mean, you can have pileups [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4449.74s)]
*  if loud noises go out. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4453.179999999999s)]
*  But like I said, we got alarm systems in there. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4454.82s)]
*  We know what that stuff's running at. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4457.3s)]
*  I mean, if something happened, I get a phone call right now [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4459.14s)]
*  and I'll send my worker in there. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4461.26s)]
*  The bigger operations, they'll have like a whole command center [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4464.02s)]
*  and they'll have cameras on every every angle. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4467.06s)]
*  Computers run the like pumped. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4469.620000000001s)]
*  Yeah, man. Computers. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4471.38s)]
*  Computers run the curtain machines, the heaters. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4472.46s)]
*  Everything's on thermostat. Everything. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4475.26s)]
*  And we're trying to provide them with the best possible [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4477.26s)]
*  growing environment. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4480.34s)]
*  And that's pretty much, you know, as long as you don't mess up [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4481.34s)]
*  with the biosecurity and go in there and bring something from the outside world, [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4484.9800000000005s)]
*  you're usually golden. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4488.26s)]
*  Now, there's a lot of like a high. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4490.5s)]
*  I mean, even with that avian flu or whatever, avian flu. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4493.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah. And humans can get that too. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4496.54s)]
*  Now, that's not transmitted from from what I know. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4498.780000000001s)]
*  You know what we've read on that. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4502.18s)]
*  That's not something. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4503.42s)]
*  There's a type of avian flu that will go transfer to humans. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4504.58s)]
*  But I think all that stuff's over in China. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4509.38s)]
*  And can we transfer anything to them? [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4511.06s)]
*  Is there any like illness that you would have or would have? [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4513.780000000001s)]
*  No, no. Let's don't do it today. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4517.0599999999995s)]
*  No, nothing that we carry would, you know, transcend over there. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4518.74s)]
*  I mean, they had a I think some turkeys had what they call like a blue comb. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4523.259999999999s)]
*  It's kind of like a coronavirus. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4528.219999999999s)]
*  But that's something that's been for years they've had. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4530.54s)]
*  And it's just kind of similar symptoms other than you get. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4533.74s)]
*  They get like a kind of a cough, chill out for about two weeks. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4536.379999999999s)]
*  It's just like a little flu. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4538.78s)]
*  But it's not, you know, it does hurt their growth, [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4540.5s)]
*  but it doesn't really like massively kill them. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4542.7s)]
*  But I've heard of stuff like that out there. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4544.98s)]
*  But, you know, for most part, in the valley, we've done very well. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4547.139999999999s)]
*  And we're spaced out enough and we create, you know, good, good quality birds. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4550.5s)]
*  And another little statistic I didn't even hit you with just [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4555.219999999999s)]
*  just the industry alone for poultry in Virginia. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4561.139999999999s)]
*  You know, that's that's a 12 to 13 billion dollar industry. Wow. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4563.7s)]
*  That we provide. Wow. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4568.74s)]
*  So it's not like it's small time. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4571.74s)]
*  I mean, we're small time, but we're providing a much larger service than what we. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4573.66s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. You don't think about it. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4578.46s)]
*  I mean, people just think everything just comes from somewhere. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4580.5s)]
*  People think you just get email to Turkey now. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4582.82s)]
*  Like, it's just, you know, yeah. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4584.7s)]
*  One last question I had, why can't why do we cannot have turkey eggs? [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4588.22s)]
*  It's the same as chicken eggs. Yeah. No way. Yeah. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4591.82s)]
*  Yeah. It's a bigger, bigger egg. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4595.3s)]
*  I didn't know it. It's bigger, too. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4597.18s)]
*  It's a little bit bigger. And does it taste the same? [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4599.9s)]
*  I mean, it's not too much different. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4602.179999999999s)]
*  I've only had it a few times, but I mean, you you can potentially get turkey eggs [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4604.0199999999995s)]
*  if you had like a a lay in operation, like a small time. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4608.3s)]
*  And it's I believe I don't even know anybody right now that does that. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4612.7s)]
*  You know, like from a small farm aspect, like, you know, [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4615.74s)]
*  everybody has some chickens or something. Yeah. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4619.099999999999s)]
*  And they produce you get three chickens. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4621.78s)]
*  They're producing way more eggs than you could ever eat by yourself. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4623.98s)]
*  Oh, yeah. My sister, the name eating egg, egg, every other dying egg, [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4626.74s)]
*  just dying eggs on them, you know, dying them for Halloween and shit. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4630.1s)]
*  They're out of their minds. But [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4633.22s)]
*  but yeah, they got I love their when they have chickens. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4636.22s)]
*  I love being over there. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4639.06s)]
*  Some of the chickens get pretty friendly. Yeah, some some will. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4640.02s)]
*  Some usually the roosters, like I said, just like a turkey dickhead. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4643.3s)]
*  Yeah. Coming up, trying to throw throw bows on you. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4647.900000000001s)]
*  So turkeys are more like a rooster. Yeah. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4650.740000000001s)]
*  So that's a concept. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4653.58s)]
*  You know how roosters can be really aggressive, chase you. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4654.700000000001s)]
*  Them turkeys will chase you. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4657.9s)]
*  I wonder some of these kind of more like athletic type [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4659.5s)]
*  men's and stuff would do a chicken, a turkey egg. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4662.22s)]
*  I wonder if there'd be a market for that. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4665.14s)]
*  Like, I feel like if I'm a protein junk, you know, like I'm one of those guys, [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4666.7s)]
*  then I'd love to have me, you know, eight turkey eggs at the house. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4670.82s)]
*  Have the boys come over. Yeah. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4673.54s)]
*  Oh, I mean, I think some of them guys, they go for ostrich eggs. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4675.06s)]

*  I never even looked at one. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4685.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, damn. Yeah. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4687.860000000001s)]
*  See, it's a handful. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4689.860000000001s)]
*  It's bigger than a chicken egg. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4692.860000000001s)]

*  I think they're going to pack packs on or base on or something. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4752.86s)]
*  Something like that. Something something. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4757.26s)]

*  So I run the gyms with other instructors, a couple of guys that, you know, came up through the ranks with me. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4771.3s)]
*  And I'm currently a brown belt right now under Christian Woodmansey. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=4776.22s)]

*  from everywhere from New Jersey, Atlanta. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=5167.259999999999s)]
*  They come out and I partnered with my best friend, TJ. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=5169.34s)]
*  He's a VP of the Black American Outdoorsmen. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=5171.78s)]
*  They got a pretty good size following. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=5175.7s)]
*  And we bring them out and give them all their swag. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=5177.14s)]

*  Yeah, they got some cool groups out there, dude. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=5184.74s)]
*  I see on TikTok some black hunter dudes sometimes. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=5186.22s)]
*  Yeah, because I never growing up, I never saw that, you know. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=5188.58s)]
*  But now you see a lot more. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=5191.22s)]
*  I just had never seen it. But anyway, it's getting now, man. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=5193.900000000001s)]

*  it's just going to be good for our industry and our sport, [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=5203.34s)]
*  for the hunting aspect and the outdoors. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=5205.46s)]
*  And the main goal is to try to save as much land [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=5207.820000000001s)]
*  that we can for not only farming, but, you know, certain places [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=5210.62s)]
*  just need to go look at. Yeah. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=5214.62s)]
*  We only have pictures like that that we can pull up in 20 years. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=5216.38s)]
*  Yeah. If we don't take care of certain land, you know. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=5219.18s)]
*  It's funny, because even we went and looked in Chattanooga [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=5222.14s)]
*  a couple of months ago, we're doing a show over there. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=5224.42s)]
*  So we went out to the. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=5226.7s)]
*  The you can see some of the river stuff there. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=5228.66s)]
*  And and now there's more factories in the distance. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=5230.46s)]
*  So even the scenery there is just getting a little bit marred. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=5233.0599999999995s)]
*  You guys go up on the cliff. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=5235.54s)]

*  But it's just interesting. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=5239.98s)]
*  We don't think about all that, you know, and until today we do. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=5240.78s)]
*  And I don't think what Turkey, what it looks like to be a turkey farmer. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=5244.0199999999995s)]
*  And I'll see that picture. It's funny. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=5246.139999999999s)]

*  See you in my. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=5286.46s)]
*  But it's going to take. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=5290.54s)]
*  A little time. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=5293.5s)]
*  For me to set that parking break and let myself. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=5296.5s)]
*  Shining light on me. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=5302.42s)]
*  I sit and tell you my story. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=5308.18s)]
*  Shining light on me. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=5311.9400000000005s)]
*  And I will find a song. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=5316.1s)]
*  I will sing it just for you. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=5320.62s)]
*  And now I've been moving way too fast on the runaway train with a heavy load of my past. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=5328.7s)]
*  And these. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=5336.46s)]
*  Wheels that I've been riding on, they want something that they damn they're gone. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=5339.820000000001s)]
*  I guess now they just. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBY15cxUQI&t=5344.700000000001s)]
