*  One of them also hosts a podcast with his brother Daniel and that's a name of that guy. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  And that show is called the Bro Mally Show. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  You can check out both of these men. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=53.32s)]
*  I'm happy to have them back. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=54.6s)]
*  We're going to be on the podcast for the second time. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=56.32s)]
*  It is Mr. Sean O'Malley and Tim Welch. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=59.44s)]
*  Are you jaded out? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=86.32s)]
*  Jaded out until you clayed out. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=102.28s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=104.08s)]
*  You all were witnesses, huh? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=105.08s)]
*  Yeah, the truth. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=106.08s)]
*  The one and only truth. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=107.08s)]
*  Just him. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=108.08s)]
*  I'm more of a Christian slash Lutheran. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=109.08s)]
*  When I was growing up, we went to 6th Baptist, I think, or 7th Baptist. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=113.64s)]
*  Which one was it? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=117.83999999999999s)]
*  I want to say it was 7th Baptist. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=118.83999999999999s)]
*  Because we don't want to disrespect the 7th Baptists. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=120.83999999999999s)]
*  We were at the end of the Baptist line. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=124.32s)]
*  We were barely... [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=126.84s)]
*  You weren't the first Baptist? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=127.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=130.04s)]
*  They had a sign going into the church that said, Lord wanted. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=131.04s)]
*  So they were looking for him. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=134.44s)]
*  It was a lot of soul searching. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=138.64s)]
*  You're looking healthy. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=142.67999999999998s)]
*  Really? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=143.67999999999998s)]
*  I mean, your complexion, your build. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=144.67999999999998s)]
*  I want to know what you've been eating. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=146.2s)]
*  What did I have? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=148.2s)]
*  Or what you haven't been eating. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=149.2s)]
*  I had a crab cake yesterday. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=151.07999999999998s)]
*  What else? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=153.07999999999998s)]
*  I don't know really. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=156.88s)]
*  I guess endorphins. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=157.88s)]
*  I don't know if endorphins or something. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=158.88s)]
*  I don't even know how you have that. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=159.88s)]
*  But we're sitting here. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=162.83999999999997s)]
*  We got Sugar Sean. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=163.83999999999997s)]
*  We got Timbo, Timmy Welch. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=166.32s)]
*  Thank you guys for your time today. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=170.83999999999997s)]
*  Amen. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=172.04s)]
*  You all look very... [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=173.04s)]
*  Tim, you remind me of a hitman or a wrestler in the 80s or late 80s. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=179.04s)]
*  Oh, a gay one? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=188.04s)]
*  But he would never admit he was gay. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=190.04s)]
*  In fact, he threatened to fight gay. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=192.04s)]
*  Like, I'll fight gay. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=194.04s)]
*  I'll go 40 rounds with gay. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=195.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=197.04s)]
*  It's in the closet. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=198.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=199.04s)]
*  I've been called a fag a handful of times. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=200.23999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=202.23999999999998s)]
*  Well, I mean, when my girl met me, she thought Tim and I were gay for the first time. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=203.23999999999998s)]
*  So we've been called, been there. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=209.23999999999998s)]
*  How close have you guys ever been in a nudist environment where you guys are both nude? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=211.23999999999998s)]
*  Probably grappling. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=216.23999999999998s)]
*  I mean, you're both, you know... [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=217.23999999999998s)]
*  I mean, in a sexual... [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=219.23999999999998s)]
*  Has there ever been a sexual environment where you guys were... [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=220.23999999999998s)]
*  Double teaming to shake or something? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=223.23999999999998s)]
*  Or just even with somebody you're coaching, you're cornering him or vice versa. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=224.23999999999998s)]
*  Like in a room? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=229.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=230.44s)]
*  Have you ever cornered during sex is what I'm asking. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=231.44s)]
*  That's a good question. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=233.44s)]
*  Yeah, nothing yet. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=234.44s)]
*  I think... [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=235.44s)]
*  No, there's going to be a time where we're... [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=236.44s)]
*  Oh, Alanita! [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=238.44s)]
*  That's his baby. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=239.44s)]
*  There's going to be... [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=240.44s)]
*  Look at her. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=241.44s)]
*  She has her backpack on. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=242.44s)]
*  Look at her. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=243.44s)]
*  Yeah, I saw her, dude. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=244.44s)]
*  Are we looking at my girl? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=245.44s)]
*  That's one of many. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=246.44s)]
*  I watched seven minutes of her swim lessons. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=247.44s)]
*  Are you kidding me? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=248.44s)]
*  You think I don't know her? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=249.44s)]
*  No, I think there'll be a time where we're like double teaming a chick or like we both [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=250.44s)]
*  got a same, a different chick in like a hotel or something. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=255.44s)]
*  There'll be a crazy time because we party. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=258.64s)]
*  What did you all think of that Oscars deal, man? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=263.64s)]
*  I thought it was like Tim said, it was a nice shot. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=266.64s)]
*  It wasn't loaded up. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=268.64s)]
*  It was like you couldn't see it coming. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=269.64s)]
*  It was boom. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=271.64s)]
*  It was direct, open hand so he didn't drop him, which was best case scenario because [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=272.64s)]
*  I don't think he wanted to knock him out. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=276.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=278.64s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=279.64s)]
*  So a good slap. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=280.64s)]
*  I thought it was a good shot. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=281.64s)]
*  Do you think Rock handled it as well as he could? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=282.64s)]
*  Because Rock, at a certain point, it looks like he thinks that it's going to be he's [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=284.84s)]
*  joking. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=289.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=290.84s)]
*  And then I'm sure at a certain point, I bet it was very close quarters when the energy [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=291.84s)]
*  probably changed in his mind. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=295.24s)]
*  He's like, oh, this is not a joke. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=296.24s)]
*  What do I do? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=298.24s)]
*  Do you think Rock did the best thing that he could have done? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=299.24s)]
*  Oh, fuck. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=302.24s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=303.24s)]
*  I think so. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=304.24s)]
*  I mean, you see him kind of want to get fired up, but I think he did it the best because [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=305.24s)]
*  what the fuck is he supposed to do? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=309.74s)]
*  And imagine what would have happened if Will smacked him and it piled up, Chris just bored [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=311.24s)]
*  him. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=316.04s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I'm saying. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=317.04s)]
*  Good thing it wasn't like a boom. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=318.04s)]
*  That's the same scenario of Colby Jorge. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=320.24s)]
*  I was thinking I'm like, that was my best case scenario that that Jorge didn't knock [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=321.92s)]
*  Colby out, hit his head, kill him. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=325.84000000000003s)]
*  So you ran into Chris at the after party. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=327.68s)]
*  Yeah, bro. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=329.64s)]
*  So it was pretty wild. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=330.72s)]
*  So Spade took me over to the who actually is from Arizona. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=331.8s)]
*  Shout out. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=336.04s)]
*  I think he's from Scottsdale. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=337.04s)]
*  So Spade invited me to be his guest or whatever. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=339.12s)]
*  We went to the Vanity Fair party and then we went to some other dude, a rich guy's house. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=343.36s)]
*  This dude was really, really rich. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=351.12s)]
*  They had a machine in the front. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=352.56s)]
*  You could just get money out of it. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=354.08s)]
*  It was just like, it was an ATM, but you could guess any number and it gave you, it was like [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=355.08s)]
*  this dude was real, real rich. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=359.56s)]
*  Like, yeah, they had even his dog had like a little wallet on the side. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=361.56s)]
*  So this dude was really, really rich and we went in and like Jennifer Lawrence is sitting [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=367.32s)]
*  in the back just hanging out outside, like just in her pajamas. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=372.2s)]
*  She like lived next door, I guess. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=376.48s)]
*  And so she came over because she heard some compotion or whatever. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=378.08s)]
*  So she's out back just hanging out. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=381.28s)]
*  Like there's like Pellanopy, Pellanopy Cruise. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=383.12s)]
*  Like a, you know, just fancy people. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=388.96s)]
*  I mean, it's like fancy people you see on the magazine and they're just sitting there, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=390.71999999999997s)]
*  They had some raviolis. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=394.88s)]
*  What else did they have? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=397.48s)]
*  They had a salad that looked, it was a little wilted. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=398.48s)]
*  I thought it a little bit of wilted, but people were eating it. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=401.92s)]
*  Rich people will eat, they'll eat kind of more, they'll say it's like more artistic [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=404.96000000000004s)]
*  kind of, but anyway, so we get to finally see Chris Rock, right? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=409.56s)]
*  And so, and I'm with David Spade, so Spade knows him. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=413.20000000000005s)]
*  So they're just kind of talking and he was just shocked. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=416.24s)]
*  He was like, what the fuck happened? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=420.24s)]
*  He's almost, it reminded me of, you ever been at a party and somebody gets hit by somebody [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=423.4s)]
*  and then the person that hit them leaves? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=427.44s)]
*  And there was never really like a big fight or maybe there even was a fight, but the one [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=430.35999999999996s)]
*  dude never had any idea there was any beef or anything going on. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=434.15999999999997s)]
*  And then you start talking to that guy and he's like, bro, what the fuck happened? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=438.96s)]
*  Like what, what do you think? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=442.0s)]
*  You know, that's kind of what it was. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=443.44s)]
*  He was just like, what the fuck happened? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=445.0s)]
*  So did he not know that she had alopecia or whatever disease? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=446.32s)]
*  That's why she was bald? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=450.03999999999996s)]
*  Did he not know that? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=451.52s)]
*  I think he had no clue. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=452.64s)]
*  I think he had no clue. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=454.0s)]
*  And who don't have alopecia? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=455.8s)]
*  Everybody's going bald. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=457.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=458.44s)]
*  Well, it's, I'm not. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=459.44s)]
*  Not yet. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=461.36s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=462.36s)]
*  And when you start, dude, it's going to look crazy. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=463.36s)]
*  You go like one of those things that kids used to put on the end of their pencils. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=464.36s)]
*  It's going to be wild. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=467.64s)]
*  It's the front or the back. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=469.68s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=471.68s)]
*  Which, what do you want to lose first? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=472.68s)]
*  Do you think if you had to lose front or back? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=474.12s)]
*  I just shaved the back. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=476.15999999999997s)]
*  So I was like a good front profile talking to chicks. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=477.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=480.08s)]
*  You got to go with the front. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=481.08s)]
*  Then you turn around. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=482.52s)]
*  No, I wouldn't turn around. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=483.52s)]
*  It's a salvage yard back there. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=484.52s)]
*  Did you notice any of those A-listers judging you? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=487.4s)]
*  You know, this party, there was no, and I'd never been, I've been to some fancy spaces, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=490.64s)]
*  but I'd never been in anything like this. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=495.84s)]
*  Like apparently this is like the party to end up at. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=497.15999999999997s)]
*  Were you wearing a suit? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=500.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=501.2s)]
*  Oh good. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=502.2s)]
*  I was wearing a suit. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=503.2s)]
*  And yeah, so we were sitting at Spades. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=504.2s)]
*  We watched the Oscars over there. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=507.15999999999997s)]
*  So we're just watching. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=508.8s)]
*  And then the slap happens and it went mute on the television. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=509.8s)]
*  Everybody's like, dang. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=513.96s)]
*  And we didn't know if it was real. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=514.96s)]
*  And then all these text messages started coming in. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=516.8s)]
*  And then we ended up, oh, we went to the Vanity Fair and nobody was really kind of talking [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=520.92s)]
*  about it. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=525.04s)]
*  I think everybody was kind of in shock. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=526.04s)]
*  Or contemplating whether it was real or not. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=527.6s)]
*  That's what I was wondering. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=529.88s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=530.88s)]
*  There was a guy, there was a guy, a writer there. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=531.88s)]
*  And I remember him saying, I don't think that it was real. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=534.0s)]
*  I'm like, I don't think the acting could be that great. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=537.16s)]
*  No way, bro. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=539.16s)]
*  And so yeah, then we ended up at the party and then Rock was there, which I thought was [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=540.16s)]
*  a cool movie. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=544.04s)]
*  He's at the party. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=545.04s)]
*  He's not like ducking anything. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=546.04s)]
*  I think he thought it was really weird. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=547.04s)]
*  He didn't look like affected. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=548.16s)]
*  He didn't have like a little cast on his jaw or nothing. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=549.16s)]
*  What would you have done if you got smacked like that? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=553.56s)]
*  I don't think you, I think your reaction is so fast. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=555.64s)]
*  I think you wouldn't have been able to be hit by that. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=558.88s)]
*  But yeah, what do you think? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=561.3599999999999s)]
*  I think I would have been, I think at a certain point as he's approaching, I think I would [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=562.52s)]
*  have like, I would have at least embraced, like taken on the idea that something was [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=567.64s)]
*  going to happen. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=571.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=572.28s)]
*  Put up karate hands. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=573.28s)]
*  I would have done something. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=574.28s)]
*  Peaceful karate hands. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=575.28s)]
*  Even these. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=576.28s)]
*  Just some separation though between you. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=577.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=579.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=580.08s)]
*  I'd have done something or at least position myself like it was something was going to [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=581.08s)]
*  happen. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=583.2s)]
*  I still might get hit, but something, you know, I'm going to look like I'm ready to [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=584.2s)]
*  get hit. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=586.9200000000001s)]
*  But Rock took it like a, like a champ, bro. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=587.9200000000001s)]
*  I agree. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=591.32s)]
*  He took it like a champ. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=592.32s)]
*  What rematch would you rather see? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=594.6800000000001s)]
*  Mosvidal versus Colby or Rock versus Smith? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=597.48s)]
*  Rock versus Smith probably just cause I don't know how that plays out, but Colby versus [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=601.5600000000001s)]
*  Jorge I think, I mean, I think that plays out pretty similar to how it played out the [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=605.16s)]
*  first time. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=609.96s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=610.96s)]
*  Well, how much bigger is Will than Chris? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=611.96s)]
*  I think at least 50 pounds. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=614.32s)]
*  I know that. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=615.6s)]
*  How tall is Chris? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=616.6s)]
*  You mind checking that out? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=617.6s)]
*  How tall is Chris Rock? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=620.0s)]
*  Five, 10. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=621.4s)]
*  Wow. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=622.88s)]
*  I wonder if either can scrap. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=623.88s)]
*  Will Smith is six, one and a half. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=626.04s)]
*  Did you measure him at the Oscars? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=628.1999999999999s)]
*  I looked it up. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=630.56s)]
*  Oh, oh you did. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=631.56s)]
*  And then I got bored of looking it up because I was trying to figure out the weights or [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=633.0799999999999s)]
*  whatever and I just went to sleep. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=635.56s)]
*  Yeah, I did that sometimes. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=637.04s)]
*  But yeah, so that, yeah. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=638.24s)]
*  That'd be a good scrap though. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=639.9599999999999s)]
*  But that was it. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=641.04s)]
*  He was chilling. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=642.04s)]
*  Like the whole party was crazy. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=643.04s)]
*  It was like, like, I mean, it was just, I felt like I was literally wandering through [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=644.04s)]
*  Netflix or something, you know? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=650.0s)]

*  We've been hanging out, we hung out with her twice. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=750.64s)]
*  We were just, you know, having a good time. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=752.12s)]
*  But it makes our sex, when we have sex by ourselves, better. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=753.68s)]
*  You know, like we go hook up with the chick, and then the next night we're hooking up with [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=758.4s)]
*  each other, talking about that moment or whatever. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=761.5600000000001s)]

*  It's a skill. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=772.0s)]
*  It's a relationship, relationships are a skill, and doing things like that, like we went on [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=773.0s)]
*  a date with her, we went out to dinner, but we ended up getting it to go, because my sexual [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=776.92s)]
*  tension was too high. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=780.92s)]
*  Really? [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=782.12s)]
*  Ordered dinner, I'm like, hey, let's just get it to go. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=783.12s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=784.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=785.64s)]
*  Anyway, but doing shit like that makes our sex even better. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=786.64s)]
*  Do you have other people reaching out to you about like, how do I get my life to that situation? [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=789.08s)]
*  It's... [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=794.6400000000001s)]
*  Because you know there's some dude sitting at a dang Chipotle right now with his lady [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=795.6400000000001s)]
*  and be like, hey... [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=800.12s)]
*  A lot, I mean, it's so hard because everyone's so insecure. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=801.12s)]
*  Like it's a build up over the years and trust, and like the biggest thing for Danny is like [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=804.24s)]
*  making sure I'm not gonna like go and fall in love with this girl and leave her. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=809.8000000000001s)]
*  So it's like, there's just a lot of communication, it's a lot of years built up and listening [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=813.0400000000001s)]
*  to podcasts, but the biggest thing is the girls, like Mariah and Danny, being open to it and [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=816.6400000000001s)]
*  listening to podcasts and listening or reading books and doing their own research and that's [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=820.72s)]
*  huge. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=826.4s)]
*  And if a girl isn't open for that, it's going to be very tough to, I don't know, live a [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=827.4s)]
*  fake life for the most part. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=832.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=834.9200000000001s)]
*  Have you experienced any three bangers? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=836.0400000000001s)]
*  Let me think. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=838.72s)]
*  I've been in, oh, I remember years ago I got in, there was a lady that looked like, there [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=839.72s)]
*  was like this pretty hot chick right in Missouri and then there was her friend, I think maybe [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=845.4s)]
*  her cousin or somebody. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=848.92s)]
*  And they said they were cousins, but they also could have been lying about being cousins. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=851.3199999999999s)]
*  And one of them looked like one of those power lifters from like the, like 1910s or whatever [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=856.0s)]
*  who would lift like the big thing that it said like a hundred pounds on each side, you [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=861.3199999999999s)]
*  know, this chick was jacked, bro. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=864.92s)]
*  And I had to really make it happen fast because I had to be at the airport in like 40 minutes, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=867.4399999999999s)]
*  right? [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=871.7199999999999s)]
*  It's kind of nice and you have to make it happen fast and then you have an excuse to [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=872.7199999999999s)]
*  if, you know what I mean? [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=875.1999999999999s)]
*  I like that. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=876.1999999999999s)]
*  Anyway. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=877.1999999999999s)]
*  I'm fast man, you know, because I'm, my dick has a short wick, you know, it has a good, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=878.48s)]
*  it's a good penis, but as a short wick, bro, you know, I'm quick to the dynamite. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=884.2s)]
*  And that's fine. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=888.8000000000001s)]
*  I've always been that way. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=889.8000000000001s)]
*  I stay it up front. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=890.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=891.8000000000001s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=892.8000000000001s)]
*  Like, Hey, we're going to be talking again in about three minutes. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=893.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=894.8000000000001s)]
*  That's what I say. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=895.8000000000001s)]
*  Round two will be better. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=896.8000000000001s)]
*  Round two won't be better. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=897.8000000000001s)]
*  So anyway, uh, so the one I started, it's always tough cause you don't know like which [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=900.8000000000001s)]
*  one to hook up with kind of first and one who you are more attracted to or the other [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=905.46s)]
*  one. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=909.1s)]
*  Cause you don't know what you want. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=910.1s)]
*  You know, it probably has to be an even space in the deal. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=911.1s)]
*  And so I started hooking up with one of them and then the other one got all aggressive [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=913.98s)]
*  and started kind of shaking my shoulders and stuff and like, uh, yeah, just very like a [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=917.44s)]
*  aggro and just kind of move, just like moving, like moving my head right between her tits [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=924.5400000000001s)]
*  like that. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=929.2800000000001s)]
*  And, uh, and bro, I got so scared, bro. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=930.2800000000001s)]
*  I was so scared because it was a dark hotel room. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=934.58s)]
*  It was Missouri. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=936.5400000000001s)]
*  It was probably a day's end, you know, and it was, yeah, it was real, real dicey. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=937.5400000000001s)]
*  And so I'm sure I, you know, E jack pretty quick and kind of rolled out. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=941.1800000000001s)]

*  But yeah, I mean, they're definitely possibility to knock each other out, but I don't know [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1270.54s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1279.8999999999999s)]
*  I think they're locked up, right? [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1280.8999999999999s)]
*  I think they're locked up for a four. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1281.8999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1282.8999999999999s)]

*  Petter? [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1447.8s)]

*  No, not really. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1450.8s)]
*  It was funny. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1452.52s)]
*  Somebody came down and said, hey dude, Petter said his corner can't come. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1454.2s)]
*  So I just messaged Petter on Instagram. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1458.08s)]
*  I've never talked to him before other than on Twitter. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1459.48s)]
*  And sent him a video and he opened it and posted it on Twitter. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1462.84s)]
*  A lot of people thought I was serious. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1466.96s)]
*  I wouldn't waste my time going, I don't give a fuck if he wins or loses. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1469.92s)]
*  You want someone in your corner that genuinely wants you to win or is going to somewhat care. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1473.08s)]
*  What kind of video did you send him? [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1480.0s)]
*  Like a video of you cornering somebody? [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1481.8s)]
*  I was streaming and I was like, yo, Petter heard you need a corner. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1483.52s)]
*  Let me know if you, let me know. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1486.52s)]
*  I'll be there. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1488.4s)]
*  But that fight's going to be sick. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1489.4s)]
*  I would love, you know, I want Petter to win. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1491.2s)]
*  I want to win two more fights and knock out Petter for the belt. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1494.0s)]
*  That's ideal. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1499.08s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1501.08s)]
*  But do you think, I'm going to head up here. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1502.08s)]
*  I feel like I'm not in costume enough. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1504.08s)]
*  No, you're good. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1506.56s)]
*  Do you think though that, because now you're like, I remember asking you whenever you came [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1507.56s)]
*  on this past weekend the first time, I remember asking you and saying, dude, if you, like [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1513.76s)]
*  you just started maybe like doing some streaming or gaming and stuff. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1519.48s)]
*  And I was like, if you started making more money off of that and stuff, like with that, [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1523.28s)]
*  what's your passion kind of, you're like, it's just, I love to fight. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1527.6s)]
*  Fighting's what I like. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1530.2s)]
*  But now that you have like another life, you have another revenue stream. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1531.32s)]
*  Similar probably to your fighting purses, I would guess at this point, I mean, there's [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1537.24s)]
*  good money in this type of thing. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1541.48s)]
*  Do you want to kind of like make it a little bit longer almost? [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1544.76s)]
*  I'd be like, I'll do a fight a year, you know, like. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1551.88s)]
*  Good question. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1555.4s)]
*  I'll answer it like this. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1556.4s)]
*  I definitely make more money outside of fighting than I do fighting right now. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1557.4s)]
*  Hopefully, you know, I have two more fights in my contract, fight those out. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1561.0400000000002s)]
*  Hopefully, that's not the case. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1564.8000000000002s)]
*  I've been a professional athlete at the highest level, being the star that I am. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1566.84s)]
*  I hopefully will be making more money than I am outside of the UFC, ideally. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1571.0s)]
*  With that being said, yeah, I think eventually I would like to get to where I'm just doing [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1575.8s)]
*  super fights, you know, living, training every day. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1581.6399999999999s)]
*  It's fucking hard on the body, dude. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1585.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1586.9599999999998s)]
*  It's like some days you just don't want to fucking train, especially going through fight [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1587.9599999999998s)]
*  camps. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1590.4399999999998s)]
*  Last year I did three fight camps, about eight weeks out each, eight, 16, 24 weeks [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1591.4399999999998s)]
*  out of the year. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1596.08s)]
*  I was in fight camp and it was a lot. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1597.08s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1599.6799999999998s)]
*  It's hard to say. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1600.6799999999998s)]
*  It depends when you ask me because when I am in fight camp, I do enjoy it and I learn [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1601.6799999999998s)]
*  how to enjoy it. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1604.04s)]
*  By the end of it though, like where Tim is at, Tim has a big competition coming up, ADCC [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1605.56s)]
*  trials. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1609.6799999999998s)]
*  You're just fucking over it, dude. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1610.6799999999998s)]
*  You just don't want to train anymore. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1612.8799999999999s)]
*  It's just like you want to go out there, compete. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1614.76s)]
*  And then recently after my fights, I like to fucking party, dude. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1617.04s)]
*  I go through like eight weeks, like straight up two months of wanting to just like every [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1619.8799999999999s)]
*  weekend just kind of where the boys at, like let's fucking go because it's in camp, so [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1623.76s)]
*  much discipline you're missing out on. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1629.56s)]
*  You feel like you're missing out on everything. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1631.44s)]
*  You're just training and recovering, training and recovering. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1632.96s)]
*  So after the fights, yeah, you get a little carried away or at least I do or have been [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1636.1200000000001s)]
*  for about two months wanting to just party. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1639.28s)]
*  But if I could, if I could, you know, two fights a year, I'd be happy with two fights [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1641.0s)]
*  a year, you know, early, maybe one early January, February, March, and then this December. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1646.16s)]
*  I like fighting in December for some reason. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1651.8s)]
*  It's just a nice way to end the year. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1653.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I don't even know what the fucking question was. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1656.12s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you know what I mean? [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1658.24s)]
*  The fucking discipline with the diets, dude, you just want some sourdough. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1659.3999999999999s)]

*  Uh, that Bantamweight division is fucking fired up. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1760.4s)]
*  I like I keep getting asked who I want to fight. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1763.3200000000002s)]
*  I really wanted to fight May 7th. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1765.64s)]
*  There's a card here in Phoenix. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1767.0s)]
*  I, you know, I wanted to fight Pedro Munoz, um, but apparently he's, he's not ready to [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1768.28s)]
*  go till July. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1774.04s)]
*  So there's a big card July 2nd international fight week. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1775.52s)]
*  I'm hoping praying Jehovah that, uh, he's ready to go by July 2nd. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1778.04s)]
*  You know, do you know that you're, is there something kind of brewing? [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1784.36s)]
*  You just can't really say it or you still know? [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1787.36s)]
*  That's, that's as, as much as I know right now is I'm trying to fight Pedro, [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1789.44s)]
*  Prelin Pedro July 2nd, if he's, if he's ready to go. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1793.56s)]
*  And if not, I would like to know, you know, Pedro, let me know if you can't fight so I [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1797.2399999999998s)]
*  can, you know, look for someone else. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1801.04s)]
*  But that's, that's the plan. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1802.28s)]
*  I want to go knock out Pedro, knock out Rob Font. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1803.1599999999999s)]
*  If he beats Cheeto wouldn't mind knocking out Cheeto again. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1806.8799999999999s)]
*  Uh, and then fight for the title. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1809.8799999999999s)]
*  Do you think, and other things could happen in there too, that could shake [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1812.6s)]
*  that whole pudding up. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1815.8s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1817.9199999999998s)]
*  But do you, would Cheeto have a new advantage against you since you guys fought [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1818.6799999999998s)]
*  before, do you think there's, cause he would be the first person I guess fight [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1822.8s)]
*  you again? [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1825.52s)]
*  That'd be a first rematch. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1826.48s)]
*  So would there be, is there an advantage that he could have even from a coaching [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1828.0s)]
*  standpoint? [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1831.76s)]
*  What, what do both you guys think? [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1833.1200000000001s)]
*  If you go back and watch that fight, I'm not being biased towards myself. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1835.0s)]
*  If you go back and watch that fight, he landed one kick with his big toe on my [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1840.64s)]
*  nerve, which shut off my foot, shut off my whole leg. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1845.88s)]
*  I couldn't walk. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1848.6000000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1849.64s)]
*  But before that, before that, uh, before that I was, dude, I was piecing him up [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1850.0400000000002s)]
*  even when he kicked my leg, I was still stumbling around, piecing him up. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1855.8s)]
*  I blitzed in through a combo, pieced him up. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1859.08s)]
*  He turtled up and I went back to step, step back and my foot just, there was [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1861.32s)]
*  nothing there just laid on my back and he landed an elbow, uh, at that point, [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1865.56s)]
*  you know, I was a minute and a half in my leg was completely numb and I fall on [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1870.36s)]
*  my back. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1874.84s)]
*  He gets on top, lands a little elbow, ref stops it. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1875.2s)]
*  Um, you know, in his mind, depending on how his mind works, I would assume he's [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1878.12s)]
*  gotta know that wasn't like a, that wasn't a win. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1883.72s)]
*  That wasn't me going out there and knocking out Halley on pipe. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1887.48s)]
*  That's a win. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1889.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1890.3600000000001s)]
*  Me knocking out Eddie Wineland. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1890.96s)]
*  That's a win. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1892.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1893.76s)]
*  If someone, he lost that one. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1894.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1895.68s)]
*  You sleep like him last night. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1896.3200000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1897.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1898.16s)]
*  I think, you know, in his mind, he's got to know, he's got to know that wasn't, [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1898.64s)]
*  it's not a win. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1902.92s)]
*  He wouldn't be so insecure about it. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1904.2s)]
*  I mean, he wouldn't get so fucking fired up if he knew it was going to be like, [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1905.8000000000002s)]
*  what? [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1908.76s)]
*  I fucking knocked you out. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1909.0s)]
*  You, but he gets fired up. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1909.8000000000002s)]
*  But I think mentally he's a super strong kid, but I think his coaches saw the [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1911.32s)]
*  speed that you have and saw like, fuck, we got out of their best case scenario. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1915.48s)]
*  So that's a big fight. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1919.92s)]
*  He's gotta say, he's gotta say, yeah, I want it again. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1921.64s)]
*  I'll do it again. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1924.44s)]
*  He can't say anything else, but it's going to happen again. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1925.0s)]
*  Well, I think there's something to, and do you think that, that Cheetah would [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1927.88s)]
*  have an advantage to having been in there with them before, been in there with Sean [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1931.68s)]
*  before it wasn't, it wasn't a fight was so quick, right? [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1935.04s)]
*  If anything, it's worse for him that he knows how much faster I am than him. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1938.1599999999999s)]
*  He's got to have felt that. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1941.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1943.32s)]
*  Um, well, what about this? [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1944.32s)]
*  Hi, I'm just a big fan of hers. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1945.8799999999999s)]
*  Um, what about, uh, oh fuck, there was someone's gonna ask you dog about that. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1947.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1955.12s)]
*  I mean, it, I don't know. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1955.52s)]
*  It was, it was, yeah. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1957.56s)]
*  I mean, look, it's, oh, here's one of the reasons I think probably people would [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1958.9599999999998s)]
*  get upset is because since you have more of a name also outside of the sport or [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1963.12s)]
*  congruent with the sport, right? [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1967.84s)]
*  You have like a, an energy of vibe, right? [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1969.9599999999998s)]
*  You're also a commodity outside of it that if they win or lose kind of. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1972.48s)]
*  You're still, you had kind of have this other bravado that goes on. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1977.76s)]
*  So I could understand probably that even if somebody beats you and, but people are [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1982.24s)]
*  still talking about you or you still have your show going, you still have a way to [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1987.1999999999998s)]
*  like be kind of winning each week in your own like world and stuff that people would [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1990.9199999999998s)]
*  be like, oh, that P that it would rub people a little bit, just because I think [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=1997.0s)]
*  by nature we all get jealous, you know, or, and I'm not saying he's jealous, but I [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2001.48s)]
*  think we all get, you know, I think that would just be normal. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2005.52s)]
*  I got a lot of hate for the undefeated, like even from other professional fighters. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2009.76s)]
*  I mean, is it, you hear Colby, Colby coming in was just sound the full [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2013.44s)]
*  semper, he's like, I feel like he said, he feels like he's undefeated. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2017.88s)]
*  He feels like those fights against tomorrow, he didn't lose. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2020.4s)]
*  He thought he won in his mind. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2022.8s)]
*  And it's to random to other people, normal people sound stupid. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2024.2s)]
*  I get it, dude. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2029.04s)]
*  I don't feel like I lost that fight. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2029.8s)]
*  I did not feel like my skill set lost to his skills. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2031.2s)]
*  So I feel like it's a completely freak accident. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2034.52s)]
*  Why hasn't it happened again? [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2037.2s)]
*  Why hasn't he's fought like three or four times? [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2038.3600000000001s)]
*  Why hasn't he kicked that nerve again? [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2040.3600000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2042.2s)]
*  It's something that fires me up. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2042.44s)]
*  I love Joe Rogan, but God damn it. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2043.92s)]
*  He, Oh, I'd love to just watch that fight back with him. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2046.6000000000001s)]
*  And he's like, Oh, he kicked though. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2050.64s)]
*  She kicked his legs right out from under him. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2051.92s)]
*  It's like he really didn't do. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2054.16s)]
*  He landed one kick on my nerve with his toe. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2055.32s)]
*  And they obviously, you see me get fired up about it. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2058.44s)]
*  I'm going to get that rematch back. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2060.44s)]
*  It's going to be a big fight. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2062.12s)]
*  Um, so I mean, so along the way that'd be a fight you'd like to have. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2063.44s)]
*  Probably it's going to happen. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2067.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2068.32s)]
*  It just needs to make sense. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2068.48s)]
*  It needs to make sense. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2070.04s)]
*  My whole career has made sense. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2071.0s)]
*  It just, that fight will happen when it makes sense. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2072.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2074.8s)]
*  I don't Rob font. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2075.36s)]
*  Who do you think wins that? [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2076.6s)]
*  It's a very interesting matchup. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2077.6s)]
*  Rob font, Cheeto five rounds in the smaller cage. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2079.08s)]
*  Well, I think after that kind of thing, you'll start to get a better idea. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2082.36s)]
*  You know, that's it. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2085.52s)]
*  That's the neatest thing about y'all sport is like, while you're waiting for [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2086.24s)]
*  your fighter, you know, other, there's other little pieces that are shifting. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2089.08s)]
*  And so you're like, Oh, the whole, the landscape could look totally different. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2093.64s)]
*  You know, and what about the do jolly's, uh, more, uh, gee, it's hard to read a [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2097.72s)]
*  lot of the rent, it just, it's hard to get through it. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2104.08s)]
*  Um, is Vash Vili, you know, Rob. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2106.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2109.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2109.36s)]
*  People forget about him just because his name's too hard to pronounce. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2109.7599999999998s)]
*  People literally forget about him. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2112.6s)]
*  They forget about him because his name's hard to pronounce. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2114.48s)]
*  I think they forget about him because he's, he's the typical like kind of wrestler. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2116.04s)]
*  When he fights his time to go get a snack or it's not like entertaining. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2119.4s)]
*  There's no VAT, like there's nothing plus like side to that. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2122.8399999999997s)]
*  Those fights, right. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2126.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2128.2799999999997s)]
*  Tough motherfucker, good motherfucker. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2128.7599999999998s)]
*  There's just no, like if that fights, like if I'm champ and he's next, that [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2130.3199999999997s)]
*  fight happens, you know what I mean? [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2134.24s)]
*  Um, yeah, it's exciting, dude. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2136.0s)]
*  The divisions on fire right now. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2138.44s)]
*  We got Jose Aldo, TJ Dillashaw, Corey Sanning, Peter Aljo, like the [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2139.76s)]
*  fucking divisions on fire. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2143.8s)]
*  Cody's coming back up. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2145.6000000000004s)]
*  I think Cody's going back up to the Vantamweight or Bellator, one of the two. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2146.88s)]
*  Will you even forget about Dillashaw that he just came back? [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2150.48s)]
*  I mean, he had the one fight against Sanning and that's it, right? [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2153.4s)]
*  That fight was so impressive coming off the EPO. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2155.52s)]
*  Everyone knew everyone was questioning him for him to go out there, lose the [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2158.32s)]
*  first couple of rounds to Corey, get his ACL or whatever torn off in the first [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2162.1600000000003s)]
*  round for him to adjust and adapt to be able to pull off the victory. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2166.08s)]
*  But that's also a close fight. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2169.64s)]
*  Like Corey says, he thinks he won that fight. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2171.12s)]
*  And you know, I think a lot of people thought he won that fight close fight, [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2173.04s)]
*  but for TJ to actually get that victory, that was fucking huge. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2176.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2179.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2181.48s)]
*  That's sick, man. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2181.72s)]
*  That whole division. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2182.44s)]
*  Did you rewatch Peter versus Aljo yet? [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2183.08s)]
*  I rewatched some of the fights they post on YouTube and they just recently posted that. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2185.24s)]
*  Oh no, I haven't rewatched it. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2189.4s)]
*  I remember watching it live and I remember thinking that Peter was going to win, but [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2190.6s)]
*  then surprise that Aljo kind of kept it going. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2195.88s)]
*  So, I don't know. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2199.52s)]
*  It was slowly getting bad for Aljo towards the end there. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2201.2000000000003s)]
*  Like there were still like 10, nine, eight minutes left or whatever to fight. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2205.32s)]
*  And Peter would didn't look like he was slowing down. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2208.84s)]
*  Well, Peter would like kind of go down and he, every time he was moving, he was [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2211.32s)]
*  throwing, throwing just punches every time he was moving, everything he, it was like, [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2215.1600000000003s)]
*  it's like, he couldn't even not throw a punch. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2219.56s)]
*  It's like you could shake his hand and he would also punch you, you know? [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2221.8s)]
*  It's like he couldn't help it. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2224.8399999999997s)]
*  Like he's Russian. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2226.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2227.08s)]
*  Oh dude, Russian. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2227.3999999999996s)]
*  That's why I think Russian might be the hardest to knock. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2228.7999999999997s)]
*  I think Russian seems, I mean, you guys would know a lot better, but Russian seems [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2230.7599999999998s)]
*  like the hardest snow brothers. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2234.6s)]
*  A lot of people call them. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2236.2799999999997s)]
*  Snow brothers. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2237.0s)]
*  Uh, they seem like the hardest to knock out. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2238.08s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2240.6s)]
*  I'm, I'm excited to fight Peter someday. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2241.0s)]
*  He's a little fucker's tough, dude. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2243.2s)]
*  He's sick to watch. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2244.96s)]
*  Terminator, dude. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2245.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2246.68s)]
*  He's not like a, he, I think he is capable of grappling and kind of being like a [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2247.04s)]
*  hardcore grappler, like he's capable of it, a skillset, but to do life [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2251.24s)]
*  to box, that's a fucking fight, like actually fighting, entertain, which is [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2254.6s)]
*  I think what I respect so much about him. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2257.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2259.68s)]
*  That he has the skillset to be boring, like Murat or someone like that, but he [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2260.0s)]
*  chooses to be a fucking gangster. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2263.4s)]
*  Sick to watch. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2265.64s)]
*  See, Colby was really pushing for the Israel, Addis, on you fight. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2266.44s)]

*  Him against Israel. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2271.12s)]
*  I'll say this about Colby, man. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2273.4s)]
*  He does a great job of kind of. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2274.64s)]
*  Possession, you don't realize it, but he positions himself into these great fights. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2278.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2282.04s)]
*  Well, yeah, he doesn't get finned. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2282.44s)]
*  Like the fights are close enough to where it's like, okay, that, you know, [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2283.6s)]
*  cause he didn't get finished by tomorrow. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2286.56s)]
*  If he got finished, it's like a, it puts you in a different situation, a different [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2288.08s)]
*  position to be able to, he can't call out Izzy. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2291.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2293.24s)]
*  Now it's like, oh, he's coming off a loss, but the people are still like, oh yeah, [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2293.4s)]
*  that would be interesting. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2297.44s)]
*  And Israel's kind of the defender of the free world in a weird way. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2298.7999999999997s)]
*  So I could see him taking that just to go in like one, I'm going to shut this [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2301.36s)]
*  guy up or something kind of thing. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2304.84s)]
*  I don't think UFC makes that coming off a loss, never been UFC welterweight champ. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2306.04s)]
*  Like, I mean, after Jared, can an ear, they might. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2311.44s)]

*  They don't have their Russian state news. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2558.48s)]
*  So whatever they put out is the only news the Russians can see. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2562.28s)]
*  So they don't really know that they're invading Ukraine or whatever. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2566.16s)]
*  They think they're, they're fighting Ukraine for a different reason. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2570.56s)]

*  life starts to get more past in it. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2643.16s)]
*  So you start to think, I think about the history more because your own life is [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2644.9199999999996s)]

*  Randomly we did the pod Sundays. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2736.8399999999997s)]
*  The more popular that you guys get in, the more that your life kind [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2739.16s)]
*  of gets bigger with fighting. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2742.12s)]
*  Do you have to be careful who you spar with and stuff? [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2743.3599999999997s)]
*  Do you get a lot more selective with that or what does that kind of look like? [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2745.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2749.16s)]
*  I mean, as far as actual sparring leading up for a fight, like sparring, [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2749.48s)]
*  headgear, mouth guard, chin pads, all that shit. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2753.3599999999997s)]
*  I don't spar outside of camp. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2755.44s)]
*  I haven't for years. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2757.12s)]
*  I spar once I get a fight booked, I'll start sparring, sparring grappling wise. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2758.0s)]
*  I mean, you don't, if there's a new kid and he just looks like a complete fucking [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2763.08s)]
*  spaz or a huge guy, I'll avoid them. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2767.6s)]
*  But usually we pick the rounds for him when we're going to training camp and [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2769.4s)]
*  it's eight weeks out, try to figure out who's the best. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2772.92s)]
*  Then we pick the right kids. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2775.48s)]
*  Okay. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2776.72s)]

*  spar leading up to a fight. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2780.2799999999997s)]
*  You got to get the timing down. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2781.36s)]
*  You got to get that, that same energy, that same fucking feeling as a fight. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2782.4s)]
*  Um, but you also don't want to go in there and have a fight of the night, [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2787.68s)]
*  a $50,000 fight of the night or a fight of the night round or a fucking crazy [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2791.2799999999997s)]
*  round. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2794.96s)]
*  Like you don't want to get hurt sparring. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2795.52s)]
*  That's where nine, like so many people get hurt sparring. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2798.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2802.12s)]
*  And it's just where I'd rather go into a fight healthy with let like less intense [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2802.6s)]
*  intensity sparring thing. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2808.0s)]
*  Be like, damn, I spart so fucking hard for this camp, but my hand can't make a [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2809.56s)]

*  Labrum? [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2902.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2903.96s)]
*  You got them in your shoulders too. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2904.16s)]
*  Wow. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2906.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2907.12s)]
*  Some people do, you probably don't. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2907.64s)]
*  Yeah, I might not have them. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2909.32s)]
*  What's that for Poirier? [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2910.2799999999997s)]
*  It's speaking of, you know what I mean? [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2911.3199999999997s)]
*  He wanted to fight Nate. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2913.3999999999996s)]
*  Nate doesn't really seem like that's going to happen. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2914.3999999999996s)]
*  Colby and Dustin would be such a sick fucking fight, dude. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2916.96s)]
*  I think Dustin knows that Colby is a motherfucker to fight, dude. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2921.2s)]
*  He is his car. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2925.8399999999997s)]
*  He's not going to get tired. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2926.8799999999997s)]
*  He's, he's wrestling's elite. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2929.0s)]
*  His striking, it's weird cause striking is kind of sloppy, but it's very effective [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2930.8799999999997s)]
*  in an MMA, especially with this threat, the takedown. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2935.0s)]
*  I bet Dustin looks at that fight like, God damn it, dude. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2937.7999999999997s)]
*  I do not want to lose to that motherfucker. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2940.64s)]
*  I don't even know if it's worth fighting him. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2942.4799999999996s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2943.64s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2944.04s)]
*  Well you weigh out Nate and Colby. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2944.56s)]
*  Come on. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2946.4399999999996s)]
*  So yeah, you want that Nate fight. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2946.9599999999996s)]
*  Yeah, you want the Nate fight. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2948.3599999999997s)]
*  And also it's like, you know, the Nate fight is probably going to go the distance. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2949.3999999999996s)]
*  It's just going to be a, just people hitting each other. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2953.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2958.3199999999997s)]
*  It's going to be a real dog fight. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2958.6s)]
*  But Dustin versus Colby is very interesting cause Dustin's a motherfucker, dude. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2960.3599999999997s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2964.7599999999998s)]
*  Throws bombs, also has good pace. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2965.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2968.08s)]
*  I don't think he, it doesn't seem like he wants, he doesn't want to give Colby that [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2968.2s)]
*  like you deserve to fight, you know, it's. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2973.36s)]
*  I could see that for sure. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2976.04s)]
*  It's a big fight. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2977.12s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2977.92s)]
*  And Dustin has, you know, I feel like that in certain ways, like I don't want to [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2978.4s)]
*  give people big fights. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2981.56s)]
*  I just don't, they don't deserve it. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2982.4s)]
*  Is there a guy out there that's even in front of you that you feel like this is, [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2985.04s)]
*  I wouldn't do it? [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2988.4s)]
*  Uh, I don't know. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2990.4s)]
*  Just give them the opportunity. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2991.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2993.7999999999997s)]
*  Well, that's kind of, I feel with the Cheeto rematch, you know, you earn it. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2994.12s)]
*  What, like that's what I'm saying. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2997.72s)]
*  It'll happen when it happens. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2998.56s)]
*  Like build yourself up, make your name. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=2999.6s)]
*  I made a name for Cheeto. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3002.7599999999998s)]
*  He's got a name because of me. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3003.92s)]
*  Build yourself up, but you know, let's build the big, a big fight. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3005.72s)]
*  We'll say, you say, uh, Jan wins, right? [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3009.6s)]
*  Okay. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3013.2s)]
*  Then what, then who's cause Sanhagen and Jan fought. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3013.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3017.96s)]
*  TJ's probably next. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3018.3199999999997s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3019.6s)]
*  Or TJ versus Aldo or TJ versus Dominic Cruz is super interesting. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3020.96s)]
*  Um, you know, I don't think Rob Cheeto, I don't think the winner of that [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3024.7200000000003s)]
*  gets a, gets a title fight. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3030.0400000000004s)]
*  Uh, I'd say TJ's probably next. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3031.5600000000004s)]
*  I would, I would guess. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3034.5600000000004s)]
*  When you, um, yeah. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3037.0400000000004s)]
*  And who's, who does Sanhagen fight? [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3038.6800000000003s)]
*  Winner of Rob Cheeto. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3041.1600000000003s)]
*  And then for that would be a title eliminator maybe. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3042.2000000000003s)]
*  That's it. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3045.44s)]
*  I mean, there's, there's the whole division. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3045.8s)]
*  There's just so many fucking like, [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3047.36s)]
*  and you have to like look at it. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3049.36s)]
*  It's going to take a year, you know, every time it's like, this is a year and a [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3050.52s)]
*  half later, is that person still going to be in and what's going to be going on? [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3053.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3057.7200000000003s)]
*  It's pretty captivating. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3058.2400000000002s)]
*  You know, it's super, it's super interesting. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3059.48s)]
*  It's crazy to think about like the MLB NFL, NBA, like it's like, they just play [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3060.88s)]
*  every weekend to multiple times a week. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3065.6000000000004s)]
*  Sometimes fighting it's like, if you get three fights in a year, it's like a lot. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3067.32s)]
*  It's a good amount. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3072.6000000000004s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3073.92s)]
*  And also it's hard to even like UFC became my favorite sport. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3075.3199999999997s)]
*  Like MMA became my favorite sport. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3079.24s)]
*  It's interesting. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3081.3599999999997s)]
*  Like probably over the pandemic because it was available and yeah. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3081.7999999999997s)]
*  And it was just, I don't know. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3086.68s)]
*  It was there. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3089.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3089.8399999999997s)]
*  It was just there first of all. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3090.0s)]
*  And it didn't seem like a bitch. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3091.56s)]
*  Like the rest, everything else seemed to like turn into such a pussy fat. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3093.2s)]
*  It was just like, [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3096.48s)]
*  NBA is weird because it's like, sometimes like going the beginning of the game. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3097.0s)]
*  It doesn't really seem like it's more like I'd watch the fourth quarter. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3101.3199999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3104.44s)]
*  What was your favorite before fighting? [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3104.8s)]
*  I think it was NFL. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3106.84s)]
*  Was it? [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3108.0s)]
*  But now you start to know the player. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3108.48s)]
*  It doesn't seem like there's any beef between the teams that much anymore. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3110.0s)]
*  Like I think that's one thing that UFC still has. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3112.96s)]
*  You know. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3115.8s)]
*  It's the president. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3116.7200000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3118.0s)]
*  All day in the white. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3118.28s)]
*  You know that they still have these guys, there's still beef between them. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3119.6s)]
*  The money isn't so much that, that one of them is going to say, Oh, let's just [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3124.6400000000003s)]
*  have a good time out here. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3128.92s)]
*  Like the NBA players, they're all friends. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3129.76s)]
*  Now there's just not as much. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3131.6s)]
*  Compete like, yeah. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3133.7999999999997s)]
*  Like I have to win this. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3135.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3137.7599999999998s)]
*  I guess there's probably like, like Tom Brady. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3138.0s)]
*  It seems like that. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3139.7599999999998s)]
*  Like there's, there's those competitors, LeBron James, like, right. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3140.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3144.92s)]
*  And fighting it's fucking life or death. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3144.96s)]
*  Really? [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3147.24s)]
*  Like you could die in there. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3147.68s)]
*  I guess football is similar, but. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3149.24s)]
*  But everybody says so controlled in what they say in those places. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3151.12s)]
*  Like they all have publicists that may. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3154.08s)]
*  So nobody's like, Hey, fuck the dolphins. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3156.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3158.48s)]
*  I'm going to be, I hope we really the fuck out of the dolphins. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3158.96s)]
*  Like if one player said that they would be the favorite player in a week. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3161.28s)]
*  They can't say that they're legally not allowed to, I don't think in their [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3166.1600000000003s)]
*  contracts to be like other Twitter has to be certain, like, like look at AB now. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3169.6800000000003s)]
*  Agent Brown, look at him going crazy. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=3174.44s)]

*  than it is, you know, right? [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4160.0s)]
*  Cause like you just had, were you expecting to have a child? [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4161.759999999999s)]

*  And it seems like it's been a real blessing. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4165.48s)]
*  It was probably the biggest blessing in my life because I got a lot of money and [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4167.36s)]
*  a lot of fame shortly after that to where I don't know if I would have been able [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4172.679999999999s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4180.679999999999s)]
*  Just cause you meet guys like Steve and fucking Kyle and six, nine and fucking [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4181.44s)]

*  And like, you have all these opportunities that go come to Puerto Rico, [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4188.24s)]
*  you'll come to Miami, you'll come hang out with 42 Doug. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4190.8s)]
*  Like Steve text me, he's like, you'll get on a plane, come hang out with [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4193.44s)]

*  I'm like, I could be there in six hours, but you know, having Elena and Danny [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4197.5199999999995s)]
*  fucking keeps me just like, it really, what it is after my fights, I deal with [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4204.5199999999995s)]
*  them way more anxiety. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4209.16s)]
*  I deal with anxiety because I sleep schedule is not as good. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4211.12s)]
*  I'm fucking partying. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4214.12s)]
*  I'm drinking, I'm doing alcohol and I deal with anxiety. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4215.16s)]
*  But when I'm in this phase where I'm at right now, training consistently, like [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4218.96s)]
*  my body's healthy, I can train. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4222.76s)]
*  I don't really have that anxiety. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4224.8s)]
*  I'm not, I'm comfortable with everything with my life. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4226.44s)]
*  So, but I'm still going, like after my next fight, I'm still going to go party [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4229.28s)]
*  and know I'm going to have that anxiety. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4232.599999999999s)]
*  I'm going to have deal with that fucking everything that comes with that life. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4234.879999999999s)]
*  But I always know like I can always, it takes me about two weeks to kind of, if I [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4239.12s)]
*  just do the same routine that I know I can be content with, with life. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4242.879999999999s)]
*  So yeah, having Elena saved my fucking life. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4246.759999999999s)]
*  And I, I truly believe that because I'm a crazy motherfucker, dude. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4249.96s)]
*  I'm scared of sugar sometimes. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4253.639999999999s)]
*  Like I don't want to let sugar out. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4255.6s)]
*  Really? [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4257.04s)]
*  I get nervous when I think about like after my fights, I'm like, okay, sometimes [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4258.24s)]
*  I'm like, dude, I don't want to party. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4262.04s)]
*  Don't make, don't make me do this. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4263.08s)]
*  And I really, I want to, but I'm also like, I don't want to because that leads to. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4264.36s)]
*  Right. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4269.2s)]
*  Then you don't know how hard, how far, how far you'll go. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4269.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4272.64s)]
*  Each time it goes a little bit further too. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4273.08s)]
*  Well, this time was a little bit less pride than the last fight, which not by [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4274.68s)]
*  lot, but it was a little bit less. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4278.5599999999995s)]
*  So maybe I'm managing it a little bit better, but also never partied in high [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4280.08s)]
*  school, never partied in college. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4283.6s)]
*  So these are kind of like my college partying days. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4284.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4287.6s)]
*  So that's a lot of pressure because then you get it now at a point when you [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4287.84s)]
*  can have access to everything. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4290.92s)]
*  Oh, it's, it's scary. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4292.240000000001s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4294.88s)]
*  And yeah, with that, if Elena wasn't in the picture, could be a lot worse. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4295.400000000001s)]
*  Going back to you having kids, you should just find the hottest chick, knock her up. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4299.8s)]

*  You're right. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4312.4400000000005s)]
*  I don't want some, I don't want to be driving around and I got two baby [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4312.68s)]

*  Do you think you have any more insight? [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4611.4800000000005s)]
*  Cause y'all live in like a desert area, like cause desert creates a lot of space [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4612.76s)]
*  in the brain and it's not the same in other places. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4616.12s)]
*  What do you mean? [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4618.84s)]
*  Um, where you might have a better insight into actually getting good [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4619.52s)]
*  visions and stuff out here. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4622.56s)]
*  Oh, um, good question. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4624.280000000001s)]
*  I feel like we, when I lived in Montana, I always like visualize pretty well. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4626.8s)]
*  Is that what we mean? [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4630.92s)]
*  Like visualize the future and stuff. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4631.48s)]
*  If you would have asked me when I was 16 years old, will you be in the UFC? [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4634.36s)]
*  Will you have money? [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4637.12s)]
*  Will you have fame? [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4638.36s)]
*  I would have a hundred percent said yes. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4639.0s)]
*  For whatever reason I seen that. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4640.639999999999s)]
*  I believed it with all of my fucking heart. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4642.48s)]
*  You could ask the people I was surrounded with. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4644.879999999999s)]
*  You could ask my dad, my parent. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4646.839999999999s)]
*  Like I believe that maybe when I was 16, maybe I wasn't do you see, it was like, [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4648.24s)]
*  will you be popular and have money? [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4652.16s)]
*  Then once I started fighting, it was like, oh shit, I'm going to be in the UFC. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4654.08s)]
*  I thought I knew or thought I was going to be UFC champion before I could even [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4657.24s)]
*  name the champions in the divisions. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4661.36s)]
*  Wow. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4663.04s)]
*  Which was really weird. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4663.92s)]
*  Do you, going back to what you said about like motivation and that kind of [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4666.4s)]
*  thing change, and I noticed that too, even with like, you know, you wonder like [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4669.799999999999s)]
*  if, uh, even with comedy, when the pandemic started, I was like, I wonder if [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4673.5199999999995s)]
*  I even wanted to do kind of, it was like, cause it finally stopped, you know, [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4677.679999999999s)]
*  I've been doing it for four, 15 years. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4681.679999999999s)]
*  I mean, finally there was something that made it just, you can't do it. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4683.28s)]
*  So I think my brain was like, you just started this 15 years ago. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4687.2s)]
*  We didn't know it would go where it's gone. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4691.24s)]
*  Do you even, you know, do you want to do something now? [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4693.959999999999s)]
*  Like your brain starts to like, you just have a moment of where you can have [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4696.959999999999s)]
*  reflection, you know, um, and is your motivation still the same? [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4700.16s)]
*  Um, well, I haven't got the belt yet. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4704.679999999999s)]
*  So like that, that I have to remind myself, like I need, I'm going to be the champion. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4706.759999999999s)]
*  I have to become a champion. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4710.799999999999s)]
*  That just has to happen. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4712.0s)]
*  But it all, it's interesting with you. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4713.799999999999s)]
*  Cause it almost seems like it's just about you. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4714.96s)]
*  It's not about these other, whoever else is in the way. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4716.84s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4719.88s)]
*  They're not really fixtures in your world as much. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4720.84s)]
*  It's, I mean, it really is kind of the sugar show. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4724.04s)]
*  It's just like, this is what I see. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4726.72s)]
*  And so I have to go get there. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4728.28s)]
*  Well, it's weird cause I, it's like, I feel like I'm the fucking champ. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4729.8s)]
*  I live like I'm the champ. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4733.12s)]
*  I'm like, okay, we got to remind yourself. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4734.32s)]
*  Whoa, whoa, whoa. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4735.4800000000005s)]
*  You're not actually the champ. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4736.0s)]
*  I got to remind myself that like, I feel like I'm the fucking champ. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4737.04s)]
*  I live like, I feel like I'm living like I'm the champ. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4740.04s)]
*  I got the house I want, the cars I want, whatever. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4741.96s)]
*  Like I'm fucking banging two chicks at the same time. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4744.08s)]
*  Like I'm like, I'm the champ, but I'm like, Whoa, whoa, whoa. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4747.16s)]
*  We still got to fucking keep preparing, keep training. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4749.12s)]
*  You got to get that. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4752.16s)]
*  You got to be the champ. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4752.6s)]
*  I got to wear that belt. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4753.56s)]
*  Do you find it harder to motivate him? [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4755.12s)]
*  Uh, I don't think so. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4758.4s)]
*  Cause he's smart enough to know. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4760.6s)]
*  It's not like I got to call him. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4762.04s)]
*  Hey, you got to fucking train. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4763.04s)]
*  Hey, you got to train. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4763.96s)]
*  He's smart enough to know that how much growth he still has because [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4764.96s)]
*  still come into jiu-jitsu and you get humbled or you come into practice [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4769.08s)]
*  and be like, damn, this guy fucked me up. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4772.44s)]
*  There's still a lot of growth left. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4774.599999999999s)]
*  So not too bad right now. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4776.0s)]
*  What is it? [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4778.12s)]
*  Probably 14 weeks till your next fight. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4778.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4781.44s)]
*  As long as we're staying consistent, at least, I mean, six, seven practices a [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4781.639999999999s)]
*  week compared to eight or nine or 10. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4785.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4787.839999999999s)]
*  That's good. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4788.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4788.639999999999s)]
*  Cause you can't train like this far out. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4788.96s)]
*  You can't train like you can't train. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4790.4s)]
*  Like you're in fight camp. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4792.679999999999s)]
*  You just can't do it. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4793.5199999999995s)]
*  You can't keep that pace for that long and you shouldn't. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4794.28s)]
*  It's not good. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4796.32s)]
*  Over training is a real fucking thing. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4796.879999999999s)]
*  So right now I'm like I said, I trained nine times in a, in a week for fight camp. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4798.92s)]
*  Right now I'm training six, seven, you know, you know what I mean? [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4803.5199999999995s)]
*  Oh, so I'm not over training. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4807.719999999999s)]
*  I was dealing with quadriceps tendonitis in my fucking knee since that last fight [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4809.12s)]
*  just recently, like last time. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4813.36s)]
*  What's that from? [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4814.759999999999s)]
*  Weed? [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4815.44s)]
*  Quadriceps tendonitis. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4817.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4818.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4818.799999999999s)]
*  Smoking weed. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4819.12s)]
*  No, it's from a just tendonitis overuse. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4819.92s)]
*  Like I said, I had three fights last year, so just fucking on it so much. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4822.12s)]
*  Recently, the last three weeks, I've been able to train hard consistently, like [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4826.280000000001s)]
*  going to comp training and going back to the MMA lab and wrestling with those guys. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4829.96s)]
*  That shit. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4834.8s)]
*  So I guess you really have to pay. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4835.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4837.72s)]
*  Now it's like everything's become a lot more of a science. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4838.16s)]
*  Like, okay, you know, the fight is then you have the eight weeks or however many [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4840.64s)]
*  weeks you're going to train before it. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4843.88s)]
*  You know, kind of like where you need to be at the beginning, where you need to be [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4845.68s)]
*  at four weeks, six weeks, and then seven weeks, eight weeks is important. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4849.2s)]
*  Those eight weeks, like from right now, what I do for the next eight weeks, I [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4853.04s)]
*  definitely got to improve, but what's the most important is those fucking eight [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4856.36s)]
*  weeks in training camp, getting in the best shape possible. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4859.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4862.32s)]
*  That's the most important part. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4862.64s)]
*  And it sucks thinking like I have 14 weeks. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4863.96s)]
*  It's like, that seems like so long, dude. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4866.64s)]
*  I wonder how many bantamweight fights are on the Phoenix card. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4869.0s)]
*  They could stay, say five weeks you had to prep. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4871.4800000000005s)]
*  Just like some random guy pulls out. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4873.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4875.8s)]
*  The thing that sucks too about moving up in the rankings, it's like, for me, I [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4876.24s)]
*  have two more fights in my country. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4881.56s)]
*  I want to fight, I want to be as close as possible to the title by the time that [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4882.4s)]
*  ends up. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4885.799999999999s)]
*  Really? [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4886.08s)]
*  Why? [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4886.4s)]
*  Because that's, you know, that's just negotiation reasons, leverage. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4887.24s)]
*  Like I, if I'm coming off two more KOs going into renegotiate my contract, like [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4891.16s)]
*  I'm going to get a fat fucking contract. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4895.24s)]
*  I lose my next two fights to random people. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4896.92s)]
*  It doesn't look good. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4900.16s)]
*  Like, right. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4900.879999999999s)]
*  But, but do you have to be as close to the title as possible, or does it help [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4902.16s)]
*  you to fight like guys that are like just the next one and the next one? [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4905.36s)]
*  That's why Pedro seems like that, that, that next fight that makes the most sense. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4909.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4913.8s)]
*  When it comes to negotiation time, do other like promotions get like an alert? [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4914.16s)]
*  How do they find out you're a free agent? [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4919.28s)]
*  And then they just start sending offers and then the UFC counters them. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4921.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4924.4s)]
*  The thing with the UFC is like, they don't want it to go to there. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4924.64s)]
*  They want to sign, they want to re-sign you before your contracts up. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4927.48s)]
*  So Bellator or one or whatever other company, cause right now they can't offer [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4930.6s)]
*  me, Hey, we'll pay you this much. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4935.92s)]
*  Cause I'm under contract. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4937.28s)]
*  I can't not talk to anyone else. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4938.04s)]
*  That's illegal. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4939.76s)]
*  So I say I've had all my two fights and now I'm a free agent, whether they hear [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4941.12s)]
*  that from me or they pay attention or whatever. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4944.64s)]
*  Um, and I, I, ah, yeah, I don't know. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4948.44s)]
*  Um, yeah. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4951.0s)]
*  Cause what could they really probably all, yeah, like what I'm wondering, but yeah, [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4951.96s)]
*  even it's just stay competitive as a business, they would have to [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4956.48s)]
*  probably make some offer. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4958.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4959.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4960.2s)]
*  And I want, I want to stay in the UFC. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4960.48s)]
*  I want to be in the UFC. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4962.08s)]
*  That's where I belong. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4963.08s)]
*  That's, I want to be the UFC champ. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4963.8s)]
*  I want to defend the title. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4964.96s)]
*  I want to move up. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4965.96s)]
*  I want to be in the UFC. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4966.56s)]
*  So like, obviously it's just, it's leverage. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4967.28s)]
*  It's like that they offer me this much. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4970.28s)]
*  Like, will you match the, will you see match that hopefully, you know, ideally [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4971.92s)]
*  I have a good relationship with them. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4975.679999999999s)]
*  They know what I'm worth. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4977.12s)]
*  So if they see like, yeah, that makes sense. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4978.24s)]
*  Like it's just, it's just leverage. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4980.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4982.4s)]
*  But yeah, I mean, UFC is fucking done, been nothing but good to me. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4983.8s)]
*  I fucking love the UFC. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4986.719999999999s)]
*  Dana White's the best fucking president in all of sports. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4987.96s)]
*  Oh, he's great. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=4991.12s)]

*  No, at the, um, yes, I got to do that, but I also got to just go to the Apex, go to [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=5000.36s)]
*  like their offices and stuff and meet with them. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=5004.88s)]
*  We're talking about maybe trying to do something together, you know? [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=5006.84s)]
*  Um, and so, uh, we went and talked with them and then we got to, and Dana came [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=5009.719999999999s)]

*  You wouldn't be able to get any rest though. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=5473.68s)]
*  He would just be up commentating all night. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=5475.0s)]
*  He does some serious research and like some serious homework for that shit. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=5477.0s)]
*  Oh, he's amazing. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=5480.36s)]
*  Bisping hangs sleeps upside down. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=5481.32s)]

*  Doesn't he? [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=5486.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=5486.719999999999s)]

*  He might beat my ass. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=5489.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=5490.16s)]
*  So I think you got to go with that because that would be good for sparring. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=5490.4s)]
*  So I think you marry Bisping. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=5492.679999999999s)]

*  Cause he's from Louisiana. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=5504.599999999999s)]

*  It would be eating good. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=5508.12s)]

*  Beautiful lady. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=5532.4s)]
*  So I would have someone else kill her, but she would not be around. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=5533.16s)]
*  Okay. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=5537.799999999999s)]

*  I think so. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=5678.04s)]
*  I think she met up with Trump and helped some people get out of jail. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=5678.599999999999s)]
*  If you had, say you had one time to smash Kim Kardashian's biscuits. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=5681.5599999999995s)]
*  Okay. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=5685.16s)]
*  And you were guaranteed I could get her pregnant. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=5686.5599999999995s)]
*  Okay. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=5689.639999999999s)]
*  Would you? [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=5690.2s)]
*  I would, I probably would. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=5691.88s)]
*  I'd just be like, why would I do that stressful add it to my life? [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=5693.48s)]
*  But I don't know if I can help myself. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=5695.88s)]
*  Yeah, the stress would be intense. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=5697.16s)]
*  Why? [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=5698.5599999999995s)]
*  Because then you, I mean, that's just, like you said, you're on the show, you're [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=5699.2s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=5706.72s)]
*  I would do it though, just cause I have no self fucking discipline. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=5707.36s)]
*  I think you'd have to do it to see what it would all be like, you know, with [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=5711.16s)]
*  the kid would even, yeah. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=5714.72s)]

*  Like, what would you do? [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=5733.76s)]
*  Could I be drunk? [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=5734.56s)]
*  That's a great question. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=5735.2s)]

*  I'm the funniest motherfucker alive. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=5743.0s)]
*  For me, I'd have my robe open and act surprised when she walked in. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=5745.12s)]
*  Would you be hard? [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtSSjyO1q6I&t=5750.16s)]
