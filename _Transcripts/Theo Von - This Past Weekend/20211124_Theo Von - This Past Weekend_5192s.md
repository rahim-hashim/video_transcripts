*  Imagine putting lipstick on your mouth. Sometimes you see a man, you know, your boy Terry or whatever and he does a lip stick [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kPPH3t2u0Q&t=816.22s)]
*  It's fine. You know, he says he was in a fire or whatever and that's why he gots to do it. Everybody knows [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kPPH3t2u0Q&t=822.7s)]

*  Just be if you want a woman out a little or you want to you know [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kPPH3t2u0Q&t=844.46s)]

*  But now imagine a man [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kPPH3t2u0Q&t=855.02s)]
*  Instead of just doing a lipstick. He puts a lipstick on his whole face [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kPPH3t2u0Q&t=857.82s)]
*  That's a clown [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kPPH3t2u0Q&t=864.46s)]
*  Okay, that's a clown guys and that's that's where it's alarming [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kPPH3t2u0Q&t=867.02s)]
*  You know, uh [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kPPH3t2u0Q&t=873.34s)]

*  You'd see him get pulled over all the time. They pull a dude over [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kPPH3t2u0Q&t=880.94s)]
*  We had a guy bus. He was I think people thought he just had allergies or seasonal allergies and uh, and that he was kind of [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kPPH3t2u0Q&t=885.34s)]

*  And he would get pulled over and I remember one time they pulled him over and there was they just pulled him over for being clown [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kPPH3t2u0Q&t=923.18s)]
*  And [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kPPH3t2u0Q&t=933.02s)]
*  The cops are trying to talk to him and nobody, you know, it's still kind of vague [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kPPH3t2u0Q&t=934.46s)]
*  Uh what the crime was and then he took his own clothes off and he had his he had more clothes painted under his clothes [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kPPH3t2u0Q&t=938.38s)]

*  And now he's naked now. It's a crime [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kPPH3t2u0Q&t=949.42s)]
*  And then [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kPPH3t2u0Q&t=952.2199999999999s)]
*  I think the one dude he tried to climb up an invisible ladder like a mime or whatever, you know [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kPPH3t2u0Q&t=953.8199999999999s)]

*  Which is basically the ninja of clowns [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kPPH3t2u0Q&t=964.3s)]
*  A mime is just a damn ninja clown [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kPPH3t2u0Q&t=967.8199999999999s)]
*  That's all that is bro. A mime is just a clown that [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kPPH3t2u0Q&t=971.3399999999999s)]
*  He's trying to climb an invisible ladder and the cops beat him down [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kPPH3t2u0Q&t=975.26s)]
*  um [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kPPH3t2u0Q&t=979.02s)]
*  But anyway, what was I talking about? [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kPPH3t2u0Q&t=981.5799999999999s)]
*  But I think a clown is just somebody I think that's afraid to ask you to touch they wiener [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kPPH3t2u0Q&t=983.8199999999999s)]

*  But he's trying to climb an invisible ladder [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kPPH3t2u0Q&t=1001.9s)]
*  Because some clown you see the wiener it's got pain on it that thing it's like what's even going on here you can't even [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kPPH3t2u0Q&t=1004.86s)]

*  People have to wear the uh mask now [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kPPH3t2u0Q&t=3675.2599999999998s)]

*  And I didn't know it [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kPPH3t2u0Q&t=3681.8999999999996s)]
*  So in burlington's man i'm out there i'm i'm i'm giving it my all [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kPPH3t2u0Q&t=3684.62s)]
*  And i'm like man, I don't have the response. I'm not feeling some of the response and then halfway through I realized [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kPPH3t2u0Q&t=3690.7799999999997s)]
*  These people are wearing masks [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kPPH3t2u0Q&t=3698.2200000000003s)]
*  I didn't even realize it [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kPPH3t2u0Q&t=3701.66s)]
*  And um [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kPPH3t2u0Q&t=3705.1s)]
*  And that kind of became a theme in a in a couple of the places we were [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kPPH3t2u0Q&t=3706.86s)]
*  You know that theaters would ask them to wear a mask some people would some people wouldn't [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kPPH3t2u0Q&t=3711.1s)]
*  uh [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kPPH3t2u0Q&t=3716.38s)]

*  um [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kPPH3t2u0Q&t=3724.06s)]
*  I felt like but the requirement of it that was a little bit that was that was tough [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kPPH3t2u0Q&t=3725.42s)]
*  Because some places they would make you or they would come and say something to you [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kPPH3t2u0Q&t=3731.1s)]
*  So I just want to say thank you to everybody who's putting up with that kind of stuff. I know it's not easy [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kPPH3t2u0Q&t=3735.34s)]
*  um [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kPPH3t2u0Q&t=3741.1s)]

*  I know it's not easy. I know it's not easy. I don't want to look past that [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kPPH3t2u0Q&t=3748.3s)]
*  I want to say thank you. Yeah, because some people bought tickets and then they realized they have the the theaters put in these mandates [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kPPH3t2u0Q&t=3750.94s)]
*  And andrew sholes just said fuck you to a theater and went to another place [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kPPH3t2u0Q&t=3759.98s)]
*  and um [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kPPH3t2u0Q&t=3764.38s)]
*  And I love that and and I would do that too. I think uh [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kPPH3t2u0Q&t=3766.78s)]

*  uh [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kPPH3t2u0Q&t=3787.5s)]
*  The people should be able to pay to go see what they want [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kPPH3t2u0Q&t=3788.78s)]
*  I then also believe people [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kPPH3t2u0Q&t=3792.54s)]
*  Should be able to go to a place where they know people are going to be masked or not masked [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kPPH3t2u0Q&t=3795.1800000000003s)]
