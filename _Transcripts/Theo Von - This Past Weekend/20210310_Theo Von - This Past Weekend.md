# Dr. Jordan Peterson  This Past Weekend w Theo Von #328
**Theo Von - This Past Weekend:** [March 10, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA)
*  Today's episode is brought to you by Magic Mind. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=0.0s)]
*  The anti-procrastination sipper. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6.16s)]
*  If you want that small upper, you can get it. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=9.32s)]
*  Go to magicmind.co and use code THEOMAGIC for 20% off. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=12.94s)]
*  Today's guest is his second time returning to the podcast. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=20.2s)]
*  He has a new book out, Beyond Order, 12 More Rules for Life. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=25.04s)]
*  I am almost to rule number four right now. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=31.68s)]
*  And man, he's just, you know, I'm gracious for his time. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=37.16s)]
*  You know, I'm honored to be able to talk to a thinking man. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=42.46s)]
*  This man is a real thinker and an order. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  And sometimes I can think and sometimes I can talk, but rarely can I do both. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=49.08s)]
*  He's a professor. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=54.14s)]
*  He's high level in so many fields. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=55.14s)]
*  He's a bestselling author, sold over five million copies of his first book, 12 Rules [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=57.7s)]
*  for Life. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=66.06s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Jordan Peterson. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=67.66s)]
*  Dr. Peterson, great to see you again. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=84.1s)]
*  Hi, Theo. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=105.86s)]
*  It's really good to see you too. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=106.86s)]
*  It's been a while, a long while. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=108.74s)]
*  Yeah, it has been a while. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=110.53999999999999s)]
*  Thank you for the new rules. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=112.02s)]
*  I got to ask you, how many, how many more rules are there overall because it's starting [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=114.22s)]
*  to add up? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=119.82s)]
*  Well, originally there was a list of 42. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=122.22s)]
*  I published that on Quora. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=125.82s)]
*  I've heard that. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=127.61999999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=129.14s)]
*  And so in principle, there's 18 more, but of course, you know, there's an infinite number [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=130.14s)]
*  of necessary rules. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=133.98s)]
*  I don't think I'll publish any more rule books, however. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=136.1s)]
*  I'm just letting you know as someone who's trying to abide by the rules, we're doing [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=140.5s)]
*  our best out here and we're glad that there's more, but it's also, it's a lot, it's a lot [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=144.98s)]
*  to do. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=149.98s)]
*  You know, it's a lot. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=150.98s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=151.98s)]
*  Well, and you can only beat the same horse so many times. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=152.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=157.38s)]
*  I don't think that's actually a saying, but now I've invented it. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=158.38s)]
*  Well, I've seen, so I grew up in some area. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=161.9s)]
*  They had a little bit of mild animal cruelty by us growing up. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=164.22s)]
*  I'm real heavy, but you know, probably I'm glad some of it wasn't documented at the time, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=167.45999999999998s)]
*  actually. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=173.34s)]
*  So I tried to get as far as I could into Beyond Order, into the new book. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=174.34s)]
*  And it's just, you know, it's hard. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=181.14s)]
*  There's a lot of like, you have to, you have to take your time and you have to really absorb [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=183.62s)]
*  as you go. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=187.94s)]
*  And there was one part, there's a lot of parts that stuck out for me, but so far there's [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=188.94s)]
*  a part in chapter three where you talk about fear and you talk about the fog. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=194.98s)]
*  And I wrote down a sentence that says that sometimes you're so afraid that you will not [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=204.66s)]
*  allow yourself to even know what you want. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=209.38s)]
*  I think that's very common. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=213.57999999999998s)]
*  It really hit me hard because sometimes, you know, I admit I'm afraid to like, I'm afraid [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=215.29999999999998s)]
*  to even map out, even to really write down and map out what I want. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=220.7s)]
*  But I don't know exactly, I tried to really drop down and figure out what the fear was. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=227.7s)]
*  Like why am I afraid? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=232.17999999999998s)]
*  And I've had some trouble really figuring that out. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=234.57999999999998s)]
*  Am I afraid that I'll have to then do it? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=238.14s)]
*  Am I afraid that I'll then feel inadequate based upon what I really want and where I [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=240.29999999999998s)]
*  currently am? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=244.7s)]
*  So I just wanted you to maybe expound on that a little bit and just kind of share like, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=247.1s)]
*  what did you think? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=252.78s)]
*  Why do I get afraid to really admit, even admit to myself what I really want? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=253.78s)]
*  Well, I think you put your finger on two of the fundamental reasons. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=259.98s)]
*  If you don't allow yourself to know what you want, then you haven't established your conditions [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=267.7s)]
*  for failure, right? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=273.98s)]
*  I mean, if you're aiming at a goal and the goal is really clear, then you can... [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=276.3s)]
*  Sorry, I lost you. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=285.02000000000004s)]
*  Oh, you did? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=286.98s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=288.7s)]
*  Just visually or can you still hear me? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=290.7s)]
*  I can hear you. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=295.58000000000004s)]
*  Just... [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=296.58000000000004s)]
*  Okay, there we go. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=297.58000000000004s)]
*  Sorry about that. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=299.06s)]
*  No worries. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=300.06s)]
*  I might have been just being still too. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=301.06s)]
*  Somehow I might get a little still. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=302.06s)]
*  No, it was the zoom. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=303.06s)]
*  I have low blood pressure. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=304.82s)]
*  Zoom minimized. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=305.82s)]
*  Okay, let's forget about that. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=306.82s)]
*  We can go back to this. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=307.82s)]
*  If you know what you want, then you know when you're failing. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=309.94s)]
*  If you don't allow yourself to know what you want, you can keep that foggy. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=314.78000000000003s)]
*  If you don't set out the conditions for your success, then you can avoid your responsibility [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=319.62s)]
*  because again, that's not clear. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=323.86s)]
*  The problem with wanting something is that in all probability, you're going to have to [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=325.98s)]
*  work for it. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=329.34000000000003s)]
*  You're going to have to make sacrifices and it's certainly possible that you want to [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=330.34000000000003s)]
*  avoid that. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=333.54s)]
*  You might be afraid to make it clear because other people could deny it to you too, which [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=337.5s)]
*  is something I write about a fair bit in that chapter. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=341.46000000000004s)]
*  The problem is, and failing to make any of that clear protects you right now, but it's [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=345.54s)]
*  really hard on you over the medium to long term because if you don't make it clear to [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=353.42s)]
*  you want or to other people, the probability that you're just going to stumble into it [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=360.18s)]
*  is pretty low. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=364.86s)]
*  You can put that off indefinitely day after day, but the problem with that is that you [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=367.86s)]
*  age while you're doing that and there's obviously a price to be paid for that. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=372.82s)]
*  That chapter, that's chapter three, do not hide things in the fog. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=380.3s)]
*  It's a warning about failing to pay attention. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=386.14s)]
*  Knowledge emerges in a very strange way. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=390.86s)]
*  It emerges obviously when we learn something, we started out by not knowing it. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=393.3s)]
*  What that means is that knowledge goes through a transformation process from being absolutely [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=399.18s)]
*  not there to being explicit and fully detailed. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=405.53999999999996s)]
*  One step of that process is emotion. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=411.03999999999996s)]
*  For example, you might find yourself frustrated, disappointed about the events of the day, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=414.3s)]
*  but be unable to exactly specify why. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=419.16s)]
*  That's extremely common. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=422.08s)]
*  You go home to your partner and you be in a bad mood and you'll snap at them for something [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=423.5s)]
*  and they'll say, well, what's up with you? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=428.5s)]
*  You'll say, well, nothing, you're just being annoying when it's perfectly clear to both [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=430.90000000000003s)]
*  of you that there is actually something up with you. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=434.3s)]
*  That disappointment and frustration, anger and sadness, let's say, or anxiety is a sign [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=437.66s)]
*  that something isn't right. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=442.98s)]
*  But it isn't necessarily that you're repressing knowledge of what's not right. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=444.98s)]
*  It's that you actually don't know. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=450.7s)]
*  The emotion is the first step in the process by which that knowledge emerges. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=453.58s)]
*  You might have to sit and think and talk to your partner or to a friend for God only knows [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=458.58s)]
*  how long before you're actually going to put your finger on what it is that you're upset [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=464.62s)]
*  about. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=468.78s)]
*  It could be very far removed from whatever happened to trigger you in the moment. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=470.22s)]
*  And so that's the fog. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=475.94000000000005s)]
*  And you can keep things in the fog just by not doing that. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=478.04s)]
*  It's really easy. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=481.42s)]
*  It's no dip more difficult than just sitting there doing nothing because creating knowledge [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=482.42s)]

*  Well, it's, you know, we've created and we've created such a perfect fog these days. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=490.22s)]
*  Like really the fog has been, it's become such a, the fog is such a business. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=497.0s)]
*  Every little thing that can be created to take away your attention from, or that can [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=502.84s)]
*  take away our attention from figuring out who we are or like kind of spelunking inside [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=509.72s)]
*  of ourselves and trying to get some answers has really been created. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=514.16s)]
*  It's almost, it's pretty masterful how much has been created out here on the outside to [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=518.76s)]
*  keep our attention away from delving inside of ourselves. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=523.84s)]
*  Well, you know, attention is the basic currency, right? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=527.9200000000001s)]
*  Everyone fights for it and it's incredibly valuable. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=532.8000000000001s)]
*  And it certainly is the case that it's also very tempting to turn your attention to things [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=536.64s)]
*  that grasp your short term interest rather than say pursuing the causes of negative emotion. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=545.6800000000001s)]
*  That's a good example. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=552.32s)]
*  And of course we have massive corporations working night and day to continually attract [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=553.32s)]
*  our attention and there's something sinister about that obviously, but, but you can't exactly [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=559.32s)]
*  lay responsibility at their feet because there isn't that, there's a tremendous overlap [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=565.4000000000001s)]

*  I think I really do believe that that's true. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=645.16s)]
*  I look as far as I can tell, we are teaching computers to, to read our minds as fast as [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=647.16s)]
*  we possibly can. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=655.04s)]
*  And they're way better at it than they were 10 years ago. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=657.0799999999999s)]
*  And they're going to be so much better at it in five years that we won't even be able [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=660.16s)]
*  to imagine it. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=663.28s)]

*  Oh, yeah. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=670.64s)]
*  For example, I'm talking about like guess what's happening. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=671.64s)]
*  It's not like, like they're going to guess what we're thinking or guess what we want [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=673.8399999999999s)]

*  Well, they might, but they won't do it by directly reading our brain waves or anything [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=679.3199999999999s)]
*  like that. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=683.88s)]

*  So if you stand in the corner and you look up at nothing in the sky and you stand there [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=758.64s)]
*  long enough, someone else will join you. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=764.48s)]
*  And then if there's two people, then there'll be 10 right away. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=766.88s)]
*  And the reason for that is that we, and this is again, something uniquely human, we attend [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=770.12s)]
*  to where other people point their eyes, assuming that if they're interested in it, we might [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=777.16s)]
*  be interested in it too. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=782.92s)]
*  And so that's, and human beings are visual animals. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=785.08s)]
*  About half our brain is taken up with visual processing. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=788.2800000000001s)]
*  We're much more visual than virtually any other animal. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=791.76s)]
*  And so computers are soon going to be able to track where we place our eyes, which of [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=794.5600000000001s)]
*  course advertisers are incredibly interested in. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=799.08s)]
*  And that's going to speed up the ability of high powered computational devices to understand [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=802.0400000000001s)]
*  as a group, but also each of us individually to an immense degree, immense degree. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=810.36s)]
*  And so, and I think we're probably 10 years away from computers that understand us better [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=815.64s)]
*  than we understand ourselves. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=821.94s)]
*  AI machines are going to get extremely good at this because it's so lucrative to be able [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=823.6800000000001s)]
*  to gauge attention. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=830.2s)]
*  There's nothing that's more valuable than that. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=832.88s)]
*  Do you feel like there should be, it's hard to say there should be legislation because [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=836.24s)]
*  I hate to put anything on the, you know, that the gov, it's the government's responsibility, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=843.8s)]
*  but should there be like rules or legislation between allowing computers and AI to get that [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=849.28s)]
*  advanced? [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=857.36s)]
*  Or is it still just fall on the feet of us as humans just to battle kind of the dark [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=858.52s)]
*  arts of these machines that can sort of like take us into a trance and then monetize the [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=864.88s)]
*  trance at the same time? [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=873.4399999999999s)]
*  I think that legislation in some sense is, it's going to be playing catch up and it's [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=876.24s)]
*  going to be farther and farther behind all the time because this is moving so fast and [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=882.16s)]
*  with such power and it's so distributed that no one is going to be able to even keep track [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=886.76s)]
*  of it, much less regulate it. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=893.2s)]
*  I mean, the interconnected environment is changing so rapidly that even if you're reasonably [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=894.6s)]
*  tech savvy, you can't keep up with all the major changes and there's no evidence whatsoever [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=902.16s)]
*  that that's going to do anything but accelerate. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=909.4s)]
*  And so I can't see how legislators have the ghost of a chance at keeping up with this, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=912.28s)]
*  even if they knew what to target or what to legislate. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=918.6s)]
*  More and more engineers are, I think China now graduates more engineers every year than [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=923.16s)]
*  the United States has engineers. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=927.48s)]
*  Oh yeah, China, you could be eight years old in China and be a damn engineer. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=929.56s)]
*  I've been over there and I've seen a six-year-old build a damn bridge in front of me. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=933.3199999999999s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=937.52s)]
*  They're highly capable. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=938.88s)]
*  Yes, well, and lots of other cultures are coming online very rapidly. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=940.12s)]
*  And so, well, there's no shortage of unbelievably proficient amateurs online as well and programmers [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=944.1999999999999s)]
*  and programming and so we ain't seen nothing yet. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=952.36s)]
*  And I really do believe computers are going to, your computer is going to understand you [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=956.4s)]
*  so well. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=959.92s)]
*  I think it won't be long till it knows what you're going to do more accurately than you [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=960.92s)]
*  do. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=967.36s)]
*  I think that's already true to some degree, but [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=968.36s)]
*  Well, then we're at a real loss because then if I've been afraid to make a plan for myself [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=970.5600000000001s)]
*  in my life and I've been afraid and I've been living in the fog and I've been just, you [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=974.88s)]
*  know, kind of sidestepping, really putting my fucking pants on as a human and taking [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=980.56s)]
*  some action, if I'm in that fog and then the computer is able to figure out what I'm going [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=989.68s)]
*  to do before I've even done it, but I haven't even made a plan, then surely the computer [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=995.12s)]
*  is going to make a plan for me, it feels like. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1000.1999999999999s)]
*  I think the computer is making a plan for you all the time already. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1002.4399999999999s)]
*  By default. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1006.1999999999999s)]
*  Look, that's exactly what advertising is. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1007.24s)]
*  Advertising makes a plan for you. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1010.8000000000001s)]
*  There's no difference between those two things except maybe one of sophistication. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1012.44s)]
*  So you know, I mean, when you're watching something and an ad pops up, that's a little [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1017.2800000000001s)]
*  world that you could visit. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1022.08s)]
*  And the advertiser obviously wants you to visit that. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1024.3600000000001s)]
*  The problem there, because you might think, well, it would be really good, the computer [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1027.8400000000001s)]
*  can help you make a plan, but I think what's more likely to happen, because at least to [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1030.88s)]
*  begin with, the computer is going to be paid, so to speak, by the advertisers to capitalize [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1035.76s)]
*  on your short term impulsivity is that ever more attractive distractions are going to [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1040.96s)]
*  be dangled in front of you. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1046.8799999999999s)]
*  And that's likely to keep you in the fog. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1049.2s)]
*  And what can I do to battle the fog? [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1054.76s)]
*  Like, what can I do, you know, as a human to retain my humanity as things get more tech [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1056.72s)]
*  and more and as tech becomes far smarter in some ways, you know, in technical ways than [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1067.04s)]
*  I'll ever be? [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1075.4s)]
*  Well, you know, I wish I knew the answer to that. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1077.68s)]
*  I don't, partly because the landscape that's unfolding in front of us, because it changes [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1081.6s)]
*  so rapidly, it's unpredictable. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1087.6s)]
*  You know, other rules in my two books address that to some degree. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1090.6399999999999s)]
*  I think your best bet, the best bet you have virtually all the time is to try not to lie [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1094.72s)]
*  to yourself. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1101.1799999999998s)]
*  And in my first book, 12 Rules for Life, I said, do not lie or no, I said the rule was [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1102.1799999999998s)]
*  tell the truth or at least do not lie. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1111.04s)]
*  Because you know, you might, I mean, can you tell the truth? [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1113.6399999999999s)]
*  You'd have to know the truth. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1117.68s)]
*  You know, you might be able to tell some partial truths, but you can't tell the truth. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1119.32s)]
*  But you can not say things that you know to be false. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1123.6s)]
*  And in the second book, the new one, rule five is do not do things that you hate, which [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1128.56s)]
*  is also a kind of lie. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1134.8799999999999s)]
*  And I don't mean, don't do difficult things like get out of bed at six in the morning [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1136.96s)]
*  and exercise. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1142.0400000000002s)]
*  You know, you might say, well, I hate going to the gym. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1143.0400000000002s)]
*  That isn't what I mean. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1145.4s)]
*  You don't really hate going to the gym. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1146.4s)]
*  You just find it difficult. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1147.64s)]
*  I'm thinking more that you might observe yourself engaging in activities that you find despicable [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1150.64s)]
*  even right then, but certainly later when your conscience dwells on them and that you [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1157.8000000000002s)]
*  should stop doing that because that's a form of behavioural lie. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1162.12s)]
*  I think the only thing we have to orient ourselves is as individuals is our willingness to live [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1167.08s)]
*  a life that's relatively free of unnecessary deceit or of deceit at all. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1177.36s)]
*  The 11th rule is do not allow yourself to become deceitful, resentful or arrogant. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1183.32s)]
*  I might have those out of order, but it's concentrating on the same sort of idea. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1187.84s)]
*  You know, it's partly, here's another way of looking at it. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1193.76s)]
*  Your attention moves around for reasons that you don't quite understand. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1199.3999999999999s)]
*  Those reasons are unconscious. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1204.6399999999999s)]
*  You can tell that to some degree because you can't make yourself pay attention to something [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1208.58s)]
*  that you aren't interested in. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1212.8799999999999s)]
*  Well, you can, but you really have to work at it. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1214.8799999999999s)]
*  You know, it's really easy to pay attention to something you're interested in. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1217.16s)]
*  That's not difficult at all. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1221.96s)]
*  In fact, it's enjoyable, whereas paying attention to something that you're not interested in [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1222.96s)]
*  requires will and effort. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1227.1200000000001s)]
*  So you can see that there's unconscious mechanisms at work there because you can't control them. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1230.28s)]
*  Now the danger to deceit is that you'll pathologize those unconscious mechanisms because as you [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1235.28s)]
*  practice something, imagine you practice a particular form of untruth, you tell yourself [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1244.76s)]
*  a story that you know to be false and that becomes your habitual way of looking at the [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1248.3s)]
*  world. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1253.2s)]
*  Well, what that means is that you're forming habits that are unconscious because habits [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1254.2s)]
*  become unconscious and then they skew the way the world appears to you. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1258.16s)]
*  It'll pull your interest in places that aren't good for you to go, that aren't associated [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1263.48s)]
*  with the real world. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1268.52s)]
*  And so that's not to be wished for. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1270.84s)]
*  That's because you don't want to be out of sync with your automatic self. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1274.56s)]
*  That's bad news. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1281.8s)]
*  And lying definitely does that, especially if it's habitual. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1283.24s)]
*  Because it creates what, a false truth? [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1287.1599999999999s)]
*  Well it creates a false truth and a false you. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1290.3999999999999s)]
*  You know, because there's different kinds of memory. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1294.0s)]
*  There's the memory that's associated with the way the world is and that's called episodic [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1296.44s)]
*  memory. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1301.3200000000002s)]
*  And then there's another, or declarative memory, there's another kind of memory that's memory [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1302.3200000000002s)]
*  for action. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1307.56s)]
*  And so that's what you use when you play tennis or ride a bike or play the piano. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1309.6000000000001s)]
*  You know how to move your hands and you move your body and that's a kind of memory as well. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1313.88s)]
*  And you don't want to pathologize either of those because then you become, you see, once [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1320.72s)]
*  the deceit has become habitual, then you're its victim, you're its pawn because it's automatic. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1328.56s)]
*  And that's a terrible fate. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1337.04s)]
*  You don't want that. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1339.56s)]
*  You really don't want that. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1341.0s)]
*  I think your best defense against anything that's trying to hijack your attention is [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1342.28s)]
*  something like honesty. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1348.88s)]
*  It's also very useful, and I stress this quite a bit in this second book, to surround yourself [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1350.36s)]
*  with people who want the best for you and who care for you because they can also help [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1356.48s)]
*  keep you on the straight and narrow path. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1361.12s)]
*  And you know, that's not a matter of some trivial moral injunction. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1364.3999999999999s)]
*  There's terrible places you can end up. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1370.32s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1372.32s)]
*  Oh definitely. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1373.32s)]
*  I've been to some of those places and it's, yeah, and you don't get any sleep when you're [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1374.32s)]
*  there either, I'll tell you that. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1378.1599999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1380.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1381.88s)]
*  Another indication that your unconscious mind is not working properly at some point, right? [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1382.88s)]
*  Because the sleep-wake cycle gets dysregulated. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1387.04s)]
*  That's very unpleasant to say the least. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1391.08s)]
*  Dr. Peterson, so getting back to the fog and just the things that can take away our [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1393.28s)]
*  attention and how valuable our attention is, what can I do to kind of, are we going to [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1399.68s)]
*  start to see like new parts of, like new, like small societies form of people that [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1405.84s)]
*  don't want to be influenced by technology? [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1411.1999999999998s)]
*  Or you know, what do you feel like some of the future looks like as far as trying to [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1414.6399999999999s)]
*  retain some sense of holding on to my attention and using it for myself as opposed to letting [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1420.9599999999998s)]
*  it be used by outside influences? [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1430.3999999999999s)]
*  Does that make any sense or not? [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1433.0s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1435.96s)]
*  Well, look, there's another rule, I suppose, a dictum perhaps, that if you don't have your [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1436.96s)]
*  own story, then you're going to be a bit player in someone else's story. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1444.16s)]
*  Okay, so let's talk about that fog again. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1448.1200000000001s)]
*  So let's say because of the reasons you already laid out, you don't want to make your conditions [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1450.8000000000002s)]
*  for failure conscious because then you know when you're failing and that hurts. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1456.24s)]
*  You don't want to make your plans for the future too clear because then if you don't [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1460.7s)]
*  attain what you're looking for, it's very clear that you've lost it, which is somewhat [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1467.74s)]
*  different than failure, right? [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1472.5800000000002s)]
*  And then there's also the problem that if you make your motives clear to other people, [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1475.14s)]
*  then they really have the ammunition to hurt you because like I can hurt you by depriving [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1480.26s)]
*  you of what you want, but I can hurt you even better if I really know what you want and [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1485.56s)]
*  can deprive you of that. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1490.5s)]
*  So you have reasons to keep these things unclear. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1491.78s)]
*  But then, and then you, but the problem then is, is that you don't have a direction that's [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1494.62s)]
*  powerful, right? [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1500.5s)]
*  Because you're not consulting yourself, watching yourself, learning about yourself, figuring [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1502.18s)]
*  out who you are and figuring out what kind of route through life you would have to take [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1507.04s)]
*  to be engaged. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1512.36s)]
*  Okay, so then you get weak because you're not integrated. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1513.36s)]
*  You're all over the place. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1516.4s)]
*  You're scattered. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1517.46s)]
*  Well then anybody who is, has power for one reason or another, can compete with you for [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1519.46s)]
*  your own attention and win. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1528.42s)]
*  And so if you don't have your own plan, painful as it is to develop one, partly because you [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1531.3s)]
*  have to take your own inadequacies into account. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1536.14s)]
*  Oh yes. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1538.42s)]
*  And you also mentioned, you know, you, you posit an ideal. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1539.42s)]
*  This is what I want or this is who I could be. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1542.26s)]
*  is from you, the more inadequate you feel in relationship to it, you know, so that's [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1545.46s)]
*  another reason to avoid it. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1550.46s)]
*  But yes, well, that's why every ideal is a judge. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1551.94s)]
*  There's no getting away from that. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1555.44s)]
*  Now, if it's too much for you, I might say, well, make a lesser ideal, like try to pursue [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1556.98s)]
*  something that doesn't intimidate you into paralysis. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1562.14s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1564.82s)]
*  Start with something closer. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1565.82s)]
*  That's more manageable, huh? [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1566.82s)]
*  So you can even prove to yourself that you can do it. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1567.82s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1570.3400000000001s)]
*  What you really want to do is you want to lay out a plan that has a pretty high end [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1571.5s)]
*  aim, but that also consists of steps that aren't too intimidating that, that, so you [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1577.1799999999998s)]
*  have to ask yourself, um, I would like to do this. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1582.82s)]
*  Um, I should do it, but would I do it? [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1587.1399999999999s)]
*  And the answer is likely to be no often because you know what you're like, you're supposed [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1591.22s)]
*  to go to the gym, but you don't. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1595.6999999999998s)]
*  It's like, okay, well, maybe you won't go to the gym, but maybe you'd walk half [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1597.34s)]
*  a block every second day, something like that. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1601.32s)]
*  And you have to ask yourself, I write about this in the first chapter about the advantage [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1604.0s)]
*  of being a fool. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1608.2s)]
*  You know, if you notice that you're not so good at something, then you can calibrate [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1609.76s)]
*  down the goal until a fool like you can manage it and then you can attain it. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1614.32s)]
*  And then you're not quite so much of a fool. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1618.96s)]
*  And so, okay, so you have to build a plan. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1621.74s)]
*  I have a tool for that that I often recommend for people called self-authoring. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1624.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I'm very familiar with it. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1629.92s)]
*  Okay, well, and it is, it was developed in an attempt to help people write out, well, [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1632.44s)]
*  an account of themselves, past, present and future, but relevant to this discussion is [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1639.48s)]
*  to make a plan. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1644.0s)]
*  It's like, what is it that you need to thrive in the world or at least not to become bitter? [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1645.16s)]
*  And if you don't have your own plan that you're committed to, right, and honestly committed [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1650.72s)]
*  to what that means is that you will be the pawn of other people's decisions, especially [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1655.28s)]
*  now more than ever, it feels like. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1660.92s)]
*  Do you think that that's true? [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1662.44s)]
*  Well, that's that that certainly seems to be the conclusion we're reaching in the course [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1664.2s)]
*  of this conversation. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1668.52s)]
*  It's like as the powers around you become more and more invasive, but also also of more [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1669.6s)]
*  utility to you to some degree. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1675.92s)]
*  I mean, we don't want to be completely negative about computational power. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1677.48s)]
*  Right. Of course, having this discussion without it. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1681.04s)]
*  But as the as the forces around you have more and more capacity to grip your attention, [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1683.92s)]
*  it stands to reason that you're going to have to be the captain of your own ship to a greater [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1689.96s)]
*  and greater degree. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1695.14s)]
*  Otherwise you'll fall. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1696.92s)]
*  You'll fall prey to those who wish to monetize your attention. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1700.0400000000002s)]
*  So it's time for it's time to make a plan. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1703.8400000000001s)]
*  If you haven't made a plan, it's time to have a plan. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1705.88s)]
*  It's a really, it's a really good time to have a goal and to have a plan. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1708.0800000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1711.76s)]
*  Yes, I think I think that's it's always been the case that it's been good to have a plan. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1713.32s)]
*  But you know, I think it's particularly the case when things are changing so rapidly around [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1717.84s)]
*  you too, you know, because then it's your own ship. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1722.72s)]
*  You have a place for you in this maelstrom of constantly transforming opportunities [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1725.68s)]
*  and possibilities. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1732.16s)]
*  I do think it seems to me that we're increasingly being called upon to act as independent moral [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1733.8s)]
*  agents now, you know, informed by tradition, obviously, because it's very difficult to [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1741.76s)]
*  become wise all on your own. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1747.92s)]
*  But but and I suppose it's partly because we have more possibility and more power. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1750.4s)]
*  So we have to take more responsibility. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1756.04s)]
*  I can't see a way out of that. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1758.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1760.56s)]
*  Yeah, I think that makes sense. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1761.56s)]
*  I mean, and it's hard if we if we think about our own story, it's scary to make ourselves [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1762.56s)]
*  the hero of our own story in a lot of ways. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1767.04s)]
*  It feels I mean, it feels like what we would want to do, but it feels scary because you [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1769.44s)]
*  see what a hero has to do. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1775.0800000000002s)]
*  You know, you see what he has to give up presumptuous, doesn't it? [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1777.2s)]
*  You know, like, who are you to be a hero? [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1780.28s)]
*  Well, you know, we used to maybe now it feels like it's a necessity almost, though, a little [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1782.96s)]
*  bit more. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1787.24s)]
*  It starts to feel like it's becoming more of a necessity that if I want to really get [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1788.24s)]
*  through this and not only get through it, but do it well and be a leader and be someone [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1794.04s)]
*  who can affect others and be positive and be a part of what's good, then I need to at [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1799.16s)]
*  some point admit that maybe I do want to be my own hero, you know? [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1806.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1812.0400000000002s)]
*  Well, and I also think you have to deeply consider the alternatives. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1813.0400000000002s)]
*  You know, it's so as a clinician, I frequently saw that my clients were afraid to make a [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1817.0s)]
*  move. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1823.0800000000002s)]
*  I talk about that a little bit. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1824.0800000000002s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1825.64s)]
*  I think it's in that's in Chapter five again. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1826.64s)]
*  Do not do what you hate, which is full of sort of practical advice, I suppose, in relationship [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1828.28s)]
*  to career. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1833.16s)]
*  People are often afraid to make a change, to make a plan, to make a decision, to take [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1834.66s)]
*  responsibility. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1839.12s)]
*  And the right response to that is, yes, no wonder you're afraid. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1840.62s)]
*  This is frightening. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1846.6399999999999s)]
*  People, you know, they want to get a new job, so they have to they have to form format and [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1847.6399999999999s)]
*  update their their CVs, their resumes. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1854.46s)]
*  Well, just that alone is is enough to stop many, many people cold because, first of all, [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1857.76s)]
*  you have to gather up all that information. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1865.96s)]
*  And then second, you have to make a coherent narrative account of your life. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1868.0s)]
*  And third, you have to face all the things that you did in the past that didn't work [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1871.6s)]
*  out the way they were supposed to. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1876.48s)]
*  You have to take account of the gaps in your in your resume. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1878.1599999999999s)]
*  Like to make a resume is to take a cold hard look at yourself. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1882.32s)]
*  It's like, oh, God, who the hell wants to do that? [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1885.96s)]
*  Like an inventory kind of. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1888.32s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1890.16s)]
*  And but but and so you're afraid of that and you put it off and you put it off. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1891.16s)]
*  And oh, yeah. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1895.76s)]
*  And you can't say, well, don't be afraid of that. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1896.76s)]
*  What you can say, I think that's more useful is, OK, you don't like your job. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1899.1200000000001s)]
*  You don't like your current position. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1904.68s)]
*  You don't like your status. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1906.2s)]
*  You don't like your income. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1907.28s)]
*  You don't like your trajectory. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1908.44s)]
*  That's why you want to change. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1910.4s)]
*  OK, well, let's say you don't make your resume. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1911.72s)]
*  Then what does the world look like in five years? [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1915.6s)]
*  Like frightening as it is to make a plan, unhappy stasis just disintegrates. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1918.68s)]
*  And so one of the things we do do in the self-authoring program in the future authoring program is [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1925.96s)]
*  say, well, if you deteriorated according to your own vices. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1931.16s)]
*  And that went that got out of hand. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1937.64s)]
*  What would that look like five years down the road? [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1940.44s)]
*  You know, everyone knows. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1943.28s)]
*  Some people some people flirt with with alcoholism or drug abuse or or sex addiction. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1944.44s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1954.04s)]
*  That's right. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1955.3999999999999s)]
*  Fractured relationships, snacks, even candy, whatever. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1955.96s)]
*  And then, you know, you have a sense in your mind of what you'd be like if you let yourself go. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1960.44s)]
*  Oh, well, I'd be sick, man. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1964.92s)]
*  I'd be under a bridge or something. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1966.28s)]
*  I'd probably be behind like a. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1967.8799999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1970.44s)]
*  Living behind a Tim Hortons or something, you know, some type of place. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1971.0s)]
*  I'm trying to make it local to you. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1973.48s)]
*  But like some. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1974.68s)]
*  Yeah, I'd be living, you know, I'd just be doing drugs or just probably listening to Aerosmith. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1975.4s)]
*  I'd be outdoors, I bet. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1979.64s)]
*  No real home. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1981.08s)]
*  I'd have no family for you. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1982.44s)]
*  So for you, it's a vision of homelessness and substance abuse. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1984.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1988.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1989.16s)]
*  Well, you've got to ask yourself like, OK, think about that. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1989.4s)]
*  Is that what you want? [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1992.44s)]
*  And I don't I mean, think about it. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1993.4s)]
*  Imagine that that's what awaits you. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1995.4s)]
*  Well, then you have a better thing to be afraid of. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=1997.72s)]
*  It's like afraid as I am of gripping my own destiny. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2000.84s)]
*  Here's the alternative. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2006.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2007.4s)]
*  And now you've created the now you've created a reality of what that looks like. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2007.64s)]
*  So now you have something to battle against. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2011.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2013.56s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2014.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2015.08s)]
*  You need part of part of being motivated is to be afraid of the proper things, [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2015.56s)]
*  you know, afraid as you might be of success. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2021.0s)]
*  And fair enough, it's possible that you should be more afraid of stagnation and failure. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2023.4s)]
*  But you have to make those things real for you before they have any power. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2028.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2032.44s)]
*  As you're talking, I'm even realizing that if I don't make the the lowest, [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2032.76s)]
*  if I don't make the reality of what could happen if I don't take care of myself [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2037.88s)]
*  and if I were to like devolve and disintegrate into my worst place, [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2042.3600000000001s)]
*  if I don't make that a reality, it almost lets me stay in the fog even more because [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2046.6000000000001s)]
*  now even the there's not even the the end hasn't even been created. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2053.48s)]
*  I've left it all just so vague that I can just kind of meander around. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2057.56s)]
*  It's like it's it reminds me a little bit. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2061.56s)]
*  I didn't want to quit smoking for a while because if I quit smoking, [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2065.88s)]
*  then I would have to actually then do something else good for myself [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2071.7999999999997s)]
*  or I would have to then be a nonsmoker. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2076.2799999999997s)]
*  And a nonsmoker might then go for a run or he might like, you know, [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2079.4s)]
*  then achieve a different goal. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2085.0s)]
*  So one of the reasons I realized for a while that I didn't quit smoking was because [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2086.36s)]
*  if I was real honest with myself, I wanted to always have an excuse [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2092.36s)]
*  of why I couldn't do other stuff. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2096.28s)]
*  Right. I think that's a really good. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2098.6800000000003s)]
*  That's the kind of observation that's necessary. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2100.76s)]
*  So you've made three observations so far about, you know, [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2103.1600000000003s)]
*  sort of nefarious dark motives that keep you down. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2106.84s)]
*  You said, well, there's the unwillingness to take responsibility. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2110.76s)]
*  The fear of the distance between you and your ideal. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2114.84s)]
*  And then now you had another one, which is, well, [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2118.6800000000003s)]
*  it isn't just quitting smoking because that's part of the decision to be healthier. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2121.32s)]
*  Well, what does that mean? [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2125.48s)]
*  Well, it doesn't just mean quit smoking. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2126.6800000000003s)]
*  It implies other things. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2128.6800000000003s)]
*  And those things are effortful in the moment. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2130.52s)]
*  Right. They pay off in the medium to long term, but they're effortful in the moment. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2133.8s)]
*  And so and it that your ability to do that is [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2138.04s)]
*  exactly part and parcel of that process of pulling things out of the fog. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2144.76s)]
*  It's like, and these are really good questions to ask yourselves. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2148.92s)]
*  Like, well, what what reasons do I have that I don't want to admit [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2151.96s)]
*  that are stopping me from doing those things that I want to or know that I should? [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2157.1600000000003s)]
*  I'm afraid of judgment. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2162.2000000000003s)]
*  Mostly usually afraid of judgment. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2163.32s)]
*  Yeah. Yes. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2166.2000000000003s)]
*  Yes. I'm afraid I'll fail. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2167.96s)]
*  I'm afraid I'll realize that I'm not good enough [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2171.1600000000003s)]
*  or I was never capable enough in the first place. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2173.16s)]
*  Right. That's a really big one right there. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2176.7599999999998s)]
*  It's like I watched this Simpsons episode recently where Bart had to get a C on one class [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2178.6s)]
*  or or be held back and he actually studied for like two days and then he failed and he broke down. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2185.7999999999997s)]
*  And he said, well, my God, this is so terrible because I was failing before, but I wasn't trying. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2193.16s)]
*  And so I could always it wasn't really failure because I never tried. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2198.04s)]
*  I never tried, but this time I really tried and yet I failed. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2203.56s)]
*  And well, it turns out that, you know, it works out for him in the end. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2207.7999999999997s)]
*  But that's not the point. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2212.52s)]
*  I thought it was a very apropos episode because it is much different to fail when you've gone all in, [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2213.7999999999997s)]
*  you know, and that's that's very frightening. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2220.12s)]
*  Where does that fear come from inside of us? [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2222.52s)]
*  Is that a fear that's just built into like it's part of the human journey as a human? [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2224.6s)]
*  It's part of the journey of the spirit. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2230.12s)]
*  Is that something that's just built into us from birth kind of? [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2233.24s)]
*  Or do you think that some of that fear is learned over time? [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2238.04s)]
*  What do you what do you think about that? [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2240.92s)]
*  Well, I think I think fear of failure is part and parcel of of being human. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2243.3999999999996s)]
*  The particulars of that can be changed a lot by by by your upbringing. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2250.44s)]
*  I mean, if you were punished unduly for failure or perhaps protected too much from it, [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2255.8799999999997s)]
*  so you have no experience with it, then that can certainly elevate the danger. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2261.08s)]
*  Your own temperament can do that too, because, you know, sometime some people are more prone [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2269.3199999999997s)]
*  to catastrophize as a consequence of relatively trivial failures, and that can bring them down. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2274.2s)]
*  So but we are future oriented creatures, and that's a deep part of our nature. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2280.52s)]
*  And so that fear of failure, fear of judgment, all the things that you've raised so far, [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2286.7599999999998s)]
*  are are they're deeply central to our nature. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2294.2799999999997s)]
*  So you also mentioned, you know, we talked a little bit earlier about how [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2298.2799999999997s)]
*  not clarifying your future goals can keep you in the fog. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2305.3999999999996s)]
*  You pointed out you can do that equally with the future that is the failure. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2310.2s)]
*  And I think that's equally true is by, you know, you're smoking and you cannot think about that. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2315.88s)]
*  It's quite easy to not think about it'll plague you now and then. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2325.2400000000002s)]
*  But to think about something, generally speaking, is effortful. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2327.8s)]
*  And often you also have to talk to other people. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2331.48s)]
*  And so you have to put some time and energy into it, whereas not thinking about something [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2333.6400000000003s)]
*  is pretty easy. And so you'll be, you know, you wake up in the morning and cough and [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2340.12s)]
*  feel terrible because you smoked way too much. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2346.92s)]
*  And if you thought about that for a little while, you could see quite quickly where that's probably [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2349.0s)]
*  leading. But you can just not do that. Distract yourself. Think about something else. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2354.7599999999998s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Think about it. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2361.48s)]
*  Repression. Yep. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2362.44s)]
*  Play a game. Think about a think about a friend. Think about it. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2363.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, do it. There's so many things you could do. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2367.08s)]
*  So then you leave yourself undefined. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2371.08s)]
*  Well, the problem with all of that, too, is that I think then in some sense, you're destined to fail [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2372.8399999999997s)]
*  in the most fundamental sense, because unless you believe that you can get what you want [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2380.7599999999998s)]
*  without being sophisticated about failure and being sophisticated about success. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2385.3199999999997s)]
*  And I don't believe that because being successful at anything is actually rather unlikely. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2391.16s)]
*  Although being successful at something you have a decent shot at, but any particular thing is [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2397.8s)]
*  quite unlikely. And then if you put obstacles in your path, well, and you're facing competition [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2402.28s)]
*  because you're definitely always facing competition. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2409.48s)]
*  Yeah, there's people that want to define themselves. There's people that want to [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2412.76s)]
*  make that effort, that want to, you know, like open their eyes in the fog and really try and [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2415.96s)]
*  see themselves, you know? Yeah, that's going to be competition. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2422.2000000000003s)]
*  Yes, and in all likelihood, they're going to get there before you unless you think that you can [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2426.92s)]
*  stumble fortunately into what you desire. And I don't think virtually no one believes that if [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2432.52s)]
*  pushed. You know, they might assume that in some ways and act like that in some ways. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2438.2000000000003s)]
*  But if you push someone and say, look, you know, if you tried harder, would you do better? [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2443.7200000000003s)]
*  They think, well, yeah, probably. And so it's hard to deceive yourself about such things. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2449.24s)]
*  Is it more of a Western kind of philosophy that we can, like the fog is almost, is it more of a [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2457.7999999999997s)]
*  luxury almost of Western civilization to even be able to have a fog? I feel like in some cultures [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2469.16s)]
*  and societies, a fog would be a luxury maybe because you have to face real elements of [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2475.0s)]
*  survival more often. Well, we could say maybe that it's a danger of right. That's a better way. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2482.44s)]
*  Right. Right. Well, I've wondered this, you know, so let's say you're a parent and you're reasonably [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2490.04s)]
*  well off. Well, how much do you do for your kids? And the answer to that is surprisingly complicated [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2497.64s)]
*  because on the one hand, you want to do everything you can. On the other hand, [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2507.0s)]
*  if you deprive them of necessity, then you deprive them of the opportunity to know you deprive them [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2512.68s)]
*  of the motivation that that necessity often provides. And so, you know, you said, well, [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2521.32s)]
*  in cultures where you're living more hand to mouth, you don't have the luxury of [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2527.48s)]
*  making things unduly complicated. And there is some advantage in stark motivation. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2533.88s)]
*  You know, if you're really hungry, you don't have a lot of existential [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2541.32s)]
*  angst around eating. You just eat. And so that definitely is a problem. It isn't obvious to me [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2545.7999999999997s)]
*  what to do about that either. It's one of the diseases of wealth. What should I do? Well, [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2555.88s)]
*  I don't have to do anything. Well, why should I do anything or what calls to me? That's also a [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2565.0s)]
*  problem that's going to become increasingly relevant. Do you ever wish sometimes like if [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2571.64s)]
*  you could do it again, that you got to be in like a more of a primitive kind of life where you just [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2578.2799999999997s)]
*  like where things just felt like if you saw an animal, it kind of felt like y'all maybe knew what [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2582.92s)]
*  each other was thinking or something like that. Like sometimes I feel like I love being in America [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2587.8799999999997s)]
*  and I think it's really cool, but sometimes I'll see like something a national geographic or [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2594.52s)]
*  something and I'll be like, man, that really looks, it looks a lot more real, you know, [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2600.12s)]
*  like a lot more visceral. Like, like I've been to Africa before and I remember looking in the [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2605.08s)]
*  eyes of a man one time and it felt like he was like, no joke, doctor. It felt like he was like [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2609.96s)]
*  3 million years old. Like it just, like his eyes, it just felt like, man, you could just dive into [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2616.44s)]
*  his eyes and never hit the bottom, man. You know, I just, do you ever think like how neat it would be [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2623.4s)]
*  maybe to have more of a primitive type of, I don't know if primitive is the right word. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2628.92s)]
*  People obviously have a nostalgia for that, you know, I mean, that's why we camp. That's why [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2633.08s)]
*  people have a cottage in the woods. There is something about that more direct existence that [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2639.96s)]
*  is obviously attractive to us. It doesn't mean that we're likely to produce it for ourselves, [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2645.8s)]
*  although it is strange that we'll do that when we're vacationing. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2653.8s)]
*  Yeah, it is strange that we'll like kind of go back to almost like, [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2658.1200000000003s)]
*  we'll kind of flirt with having nothing kind of. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2661.32s)]
*  Yeah. And it isn't, it isn't exactly obvious. Well, and it's also interesting that we regard [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2663.88s)]
*  that as a break. And I think part of the reason for that, look, there isn't a lot of evidence [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2668.6800000000003s)]
*  that people in industrialized societies are happier than people who are in non-industrialized [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2673.7200000000003s)]
*  societies. In fact, the evidence is actually quite the reverse. I would believe that. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2679.96s)]
*  And I think the reason perhaps not the reason, our reason, because there's usually many reasons [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2685.16s)]
*  for anything is that it requires constant, it requires a certain amount of constant deferral [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2691.16s)]
*  of gratification to maintain an industrialized lifestyle. You're not living in the moment. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2700.12s)]
*  You're always putting off the moment so that, well, so that you'll live longer. So, I mean, [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2705.64s)]
*  one of the advantages of being in an industrialized society is that your life expectancy is much [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2710.44s)]
*  longer, but there is something that's more primordially satisfying about, or there seems [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2714.8399999999997s)]
*  to be about a lifestyle where the actions and the rewards and the punishments aren't so separated. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2721.4s)]
*  You know, you're going to medical school, you're slaving away, let's say, [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2730.36s)]
*  the reward for that is deferred far into the future. And you're giving up all sorts of [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2735.0s)]
*  momentary pleasures. And there's a cost associated with that as well. Now, [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2741.48s)]
*  and it isn't an easy one to, well, it's the constant battle that we have between what's good [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2750.12s)]
*  in the moment and what's good over the long run. It's a very difficult thing to get right. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2755.88s)]
*  Yeah. And our existence here is more about what's good over the long run. Maybe it's a little more [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2760.6800000000003s)]
*  like that. Well, that's yes. Well, at least the culture is built that way. Right. Right. Yeah. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2764.84s)]
*  Yeah. It's built on deferral of gratification and so on. And so that makes it kind of insipid in [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2770.44s)]
*  some ways. It isn't as adventurous or exciting. Yeah. Yeah. Or it doesn't seem that way. It's [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2779.24s)]
*  interesting though. I mean, it seems that people who are in less industrialized countries and have [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2785.3999999999996s)]
*  a less industrialized existence will trade that quite rapidly for the opportunity to progress, [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2791.9599999999996s)]
*  so to speak, economically. So yeah. All right. Let me crack in a little liquid death here as I [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2798.2799999999997s)]
*  hit these ad reads. COVID spring break is right around the corner. People are going to be running [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2805.08s)]

*  happiness in not goal scoring, but like I noticed in my own life in the past year, since I spoke to [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2970.2s)]
*  you last, you know, I've probably had some a decent amount of success and life kind of got a little [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2979.48s)]
*  bit more exciting with doing some touring and, you know, was more financially rewarding. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2984.04s)]
*  But I found that I was really not unhappy. I was grateful, but I guess I was a little unhappy. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2992.36s)]
*  I think I always felt like when I got to a certain level of success that the questions that I had [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=2998.68s)]
*  inside of my heart or inside of my brain or the discomfort, I felt like everything would go away. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3007.64s)]
*  Like life would hand me some like, like magic answer book that had a couple of decent answers [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3014.04s)]
*  in it, you know, but then like beyond order. Yes. Yes. Like beyond order, like there would be, [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3019.72s)]
*  okay, you did it. You know, like somebody comes out from behind the door and they're like, all [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3026.44s)]
*  right, bucko, you know, like finally Oz comes out, you know, and, um, right. But it not and says good [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3030.44s)]
*  job, but that never happens. No, no. Well, you know, that's, that's another indication of, [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3036.36s)]
*  of the perverseness of human beings to some degree. So look, there are, there are two kinds [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3043.48s)]
*  of reward. Technically speaking, there's satisfaction and there's incentive reward and [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3049.08s)]
*  satisfaction is the reward that you were sort of dreaming about. It's, it's the, so you're hungry [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3055.64s)]
*  and you have Thanksgiving dinner and you're no longer hungry. That's a reward. That's satiation. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3061.08s)]
*  It's satisfying. It, it stops you from being hungry. Well, you think, well, I'm hungry. I don't [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3065.96s)]
*  want to be hungry anymore, but hunger did give you something to do. And there was the anticipation [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3071.64s)]
*  of the meal, you know, and sometimes on Thanksgiving day, people will not eat all day just to heighten [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3076.92s)]
*  the anticipation, right? Because that increases the incentive reward and incentive reward is what you [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3082.2s)]
*  experience when you're moving towards a desired goal rather than when you attain it. And we do [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3089.16s)]
*  have this vision. It's a vision of utopia and probably is what motivates utopian thinking, [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3094.92s)]
*  motivates ideas of the promised land, which is milk and honey. That if we just turn the corner [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3100.2s)]
*  and get to here, everything will be all right. And that, that isn't the case. We're, we're wired up so [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3105.96s)]
*  that the pursuit is often more engaging than the, than the acquisition. Yeah. I wish I had to realize [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3115.56s)]
*  that though, as I was trying to acquire, I didn't, there were, it's like, it's such a tough thing. I [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3122.6s)]
*  missed some of the moments of the pursuit because I was so focused, I think on this [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3128.44s)]
*  end goal that would make any of the uncomfort or all it would make all the pain of the sacrifice. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3133.16s)]
*  It would make it all worth it kind of. Right, right, right. Well that, that there is some utility in [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3140.28s)]
*  that sort of dream too, because it, having that image of the future also motivates you to pursue [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3146.44s)]
*  it. But the problem with that kind of thinking, I suppose too, is that this is, Dostoevsky raised [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3151.72s)]
*  this in notes from underground. It's a great short book and he criticized it. If it's short, I'll give it a chance, man. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3158.7599999999998s)]
*  It's a great book. It's a great book. It's really, it's a real punch, that book. And it contains a very [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3165.7999999999997s)]
*  powerful critique of the idea of utopia and Dostoevsky's, and he was talking about the sort [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3172.04s)]
*  of precursors to the Russian communists and their notion. If you just gave everybody enough [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3177.72s)]
*  material resources, then all of a sudden the problems of the world would disappear. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3182.2s)]
*  Dostoevsky, first of all, points out that that's nonsense because, for reasons that are similar to [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3187.16s)]
*  the ones that you laid out, but also that even if it was true, people are so perverse in a sense, [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3193.64s)]
*  we're such peculiar creatures that we would smash our happiness all to pieces out of sheer boredom, [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3199.9599999999996s)]
*  just so something new and exciting could happen, so that we would have something to do again. And [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3207.0s)]
*  I read that and I thought, wow, that's exactly right. It's that it's this searching that's part [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3211.24s)]
*  of our essential nature is not only insatiable, but it's actually desirable because, well, what [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3216.6s)]
*  do you do? You shake hands with Oz and then you die? It's like, done, I'm over. Well, you don't, [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3225.96s)]
*  because you want to get on to the next great adventure. And so it is, you know, the Sermon [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3232.04s)]
*  on the Mount seems to address this to me, this fundamental problem. And my reading of it anyways [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3239.0s)]
*  is something like align yourself with the highest good that you're capable of imagining. And so for [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3245.24s)]
*  all intents and purposes, that's God, the sum total of all that's good, and you live in relationship [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3252.92s)]
*  to that and then concentrate on the moment. And see, it seems to me that way you get to have your [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3258.84s)]
*  cake and eat it too, right? Because you're aiming at something that's like the promised land, this [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3266.52s)]
*  proverbial utopia. It's it by definition is the best possible thing. And maybe your view of that's [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3271.6400000000003s)]
*  going to change as you mature, but it doesn't matter. That's still going to orient you. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3278.1200000000003s)]
*  And having that in mind, so now you're pointing in the right direction, you can attend very [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3281.8s)]
*  carefully to the details of the pursuit. And that's, I think that's, that's the best we can do. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3287.08s)]
*  Well, I certainly haven't. Well, I did come from the Sermon on the Mount. So hypothetically, [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3294.68s)]
*  it's a reliable source, you know, but I think it makes a tremendous amount of sense psychologically. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3299.88s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, why would you not aim at the best that you could conceptualize if you were going [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3305.3199999999997s)]
*  to aim? Right. And having done that, well, then it is reasonable to concentrate on the present [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3310.2s)]
*  and then you can then you can immerse yourself in the present and enjoy it. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3317.16s)]
*  And then you don't perhaps have those regrets that you described of missing the voyage because [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3324.2s)]
*  you were so focused on the on the on the say the material luxury. Yeah. And material luxury is a [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3329.16s)]
*  strange thing too, you know, I mean, it isn't obvious often whether you own something or it [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3337.0s)]
*  owns you. And I don't mean that in a flippant sense. Oh, I wouldn't at all. Recently I was [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3342.92s)]
*  investing in, you know, people doing cryptocurrency now it's like invisible. I don't even know what it [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3347.48s)]
*  is, you know, but it's people are excited by it. And I started to notice those markets on this [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3352.36s)]
*  crypto thing. And and I didn't mean to interrupt you, Dr. No, please go ahead. Thanks. So but I [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3358.6s)]
*  noticed like, I'd wake up in the middle of the night and I would check this thing. And finally, [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3365.32s)]
*  I realized like, whatever monies I'm going to possibly make in this portal, this gambling [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3369.8s)]
*  portal of cryptocurrency, which no judgment on it, I don't know enough about it to really judge it, [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3376.6000000000004s)]
*  but I'm spending like, important time checking it. I was just I realized I became a slave to it, [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3382.04s)]
*  like, and so I just sold it all. I don't want I just it did I in my heart and in my chest, [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3389.0800000000004s)]
*  it didn't feel good having that distraction to check all the time about what was going on with [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3395.64s)]
*  this money. It just felt like it owned me. And, and I immediately decided, you know what, I just [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3401.4s)]
*  don't want to be owned by this maybe something else, but just not this, you know. Right. And [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3407.24s)]
*  was it specifically the worry about it that was bothering you? Or what what do you think triggered [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3412.12s)]
*  or or alerted you to the fact that that pursuit wasn't for you? That's a great question. I think [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3417.0s)]
*  it was I couldn't control myself. This is the truth. I couldn't control myself from checking it. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3423.8s)]
*  And so the only alternative I had was to eliminate it. Because I was really having trouble. And it [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3433.88s)]
*  doesn't fully answer your question, but I was just having trouble stop checking it. So I just said, [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3441.0s)]
*  I have to get rid of it. Well, it answers it to some degree, you found to your surprise. See, [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3444.6800000000003s)]
*  this is partly what I what we were talking earlier about not hiding things in the fog. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3450.76s)]
*  This is part of the process of coming to a clearer vision of yourself is noticing exactly that. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3456.36s)]
*  Because your theory was, well, I can buy this cryptocurrency, and maybe I'll make some money. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3462.0400000000004s)]
*  But regardless, one way or another, this is going to make my life better. You had a theory of yourself [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3467.0800000000004s)]
*  and you had a theory of the money. Yeah, well, it turns out that that was wrong. Now, why exactly? [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3473.2400000000002s)]
*  We don't know. But the consequence of that was that you became a slave to a set of impulses that [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3479.08s)]
*  you didn't find enjoyable in the least. Yeah. And that is and so then you stop doing it. And [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3485.7999999999997s)]
*  fair enough. That seems to be the right solution. Yeah. And that's kind of a simple scale, I think. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3492.04s)]
*  And that scale evolves as I get a little bit older of does this make me feel good? Like, [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3497.16s)]
*  does it really make me feel good? Like even sometimes making some money doesn't really make [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3503.24s)]
*  me feel good. You know, like, does it make me feel good as like a human as like a [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3507.72s)]
*  something that has to be alive? Does it feel like it like brightens that part of me that makes me [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3514.9199999999996s)]
*  feel proud? You know, I guess. I don't know. I'm trying to explain it. No, that's a great thing [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3521.64s)]
*  to explain as far as I'm concerned. Because look, you said, does it make you feel good? And then [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3527.0s)]
*  you started to investigate what good meant. And while both of those things are really worth doing, [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3533.0s)]
*  they're not foolish in the least. Because what's good, you know, when you brought in the idea of [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3538.52s)]
*  being alive, which, you know, you might think, well, why did you bring in the idea of being [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3543.08s)]
*  alive? Obviously, you're alive. But you're you're there's a theory there that's emerging too, which [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3546.92s)]
*  is, well, I'm a living creature. And I'm well, this African that you saw who was so old, you're that [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3552.04s)]
*  old, you're really old, you know, life has been around for three and a half billion years, we're [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3558.6s)]
*  really old, and God only knows what we're up to, or who we are. And so you say, well, we're going to [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3563.88s)]
*  pursue what's good. And what is that? Well, it has something to do with the fact that we're alive, [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3569.7999999999997s)]
*  we have to serve our own biological reality, we have to address the good in a manner that's [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3575.96s)]
*  right for us as living creatures. And so you say, well, we have to pursue the good, but we also have [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3584.6s)]
*  to figure out what it means, what the good means. You know, and that's partly what I'm trying to do [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3591.08s)]
*  in, well, in Beyond Order, my other books, I looked a lot at traditional ideas of the good, [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3597.32s)]
*  most of those are grounded in religious conceptions, you know, what does it mean to [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3603.32s)]
*  pursue the good? What does it mean to be a good person? Well, these are very complicated problems. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3608.44s)]
*  And, but you don't get a free pass on them. If you're murky about them, then, well, you're ill [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3614.28s)]
*  defined and vague and inarticulate in your own life. And that's not, there's comfort in that. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3625.6400000000003s)]
*  It's comfortable. Yeah, it's very comfortable. It's like a nice very, it's like a nice shawl [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3632.6800000000003s)]
*  or something, you know, it's almost, it's merino wool. I mean, it's nice, you know, it's really [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3637.0800000000004s)]
*  comfortable. I'm not going to be comfortable and not have to ask myself, am I happy? Am I [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3642.92s)]
*  being of service? Do I feel like I'm contributing anything to the world? Do I feel like [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3648.44s)]
*  I'm being honest? Do I love myself? You know, do I love others? Am I being a good brother? [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3655.16s)]
*  Am I being a good son? If some of the answers aren't what I want them to be, am I trying [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3664.6s)]
*  in some way to maybe get to answers that I'm more happy with? You know, am I proud of myself? [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3671.7200000000003s)]
*  Am I ashamed of myself? Where does my shame come from? You know? Yeah, well, that's a good question. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3681.2400000000002s)]
*  That's a really tricky question. That's when I feel a lot. When you just feel a lot, I feel, [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3689.1600000000003s)]
*  you know, shame really, it's such a powerful thing. Sometimes I'm carrying shame. I don't [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3695.48s)]
*  even know if it's my own. Yes, well, that's why there's the concept of original sin. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3700.12s)]
*  You know, the shame is such a universal human emotion. It saturates our existence. It's [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3706.52s)]
*  partly because we're so social, you know, and so the sense that we have a responsibility to [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3712.68s)]
*  ourselves and to others is really built into us at a very, very profound level, multiple, [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3718.92s)]
*  in multiple ways. And we exist in relationship to that shame all the time. And it's easy to say, [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3725.3199999999997s)]
*  well, you should dispense with it, you know, and, but it's not so easy to do. And it's not even clear [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3732.52s)]
*  how you should go about dispensing with it. You know, I've seen people in my clinical practice who [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3739.64s)]
*  had what seemed to be seem to be counterproductive levels of shame, right? They would do things that [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3745.3199999999997s)]
*  someone else might do and then punish themselves far more than seemed appropriate. And I started [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3752.92s)]
*  to think about what does it mean to punish yourself appropriately? Philosophy of punishment, [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3759.48s)]
*  which I outlined to some degree in the first book on the chapter on children, which is don't let your [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3764.52s)]
*  children do anything that makes you dislike them. Well, you have to stop them. Well, how do you stop [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3769.2400000000002s)]
*  people? Well, you punish them one way or another, even if it's just withdrawal of attention. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3773.64s)]
*  So then, well, how should you punish, assuming there are standards, etc.? Well, one rule, at least [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3778.8399999999997s)]
*  with regards to yourself is you shouldn't hit yourself harder than is necessary to teach you. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3785.16s)]
*  Right? So if you've learned your lesson, good enough. And I think that's also often a [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3791.0s)]
*  pre condition for forgiving other people. It's like, well, you know, did they learn their lesson? [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3796.52s)]
*  Yes. Well, then maybe you can let it go because additional punishment, what is it going to make [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3802.52s)]
*  them learn their lesson even more? Why will I forgive myself? Why will I forgive other people [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3807.8s)]
*  before I forgive myself? I wonder. Well, that's a good question because it isn't obvious that [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3813.32s)]
*  you should, right? Because, you know, we tend to think that people are selfish and they put [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3818.84s)]
*  themselves first, but it's just as common. The reverse is just as common where they'll be better [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3825.5600000000004s)]
*  to other people than to themselves. Yeah, I feel that a lot. Yes, I think it's more common than the [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3831.64s)]
*  reverse, actually. Although people can act selfishly from time to time, I do think that most people [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3838.8399999999997s)]
*  punish themselves more than they punish other people. And that's also something to be aware [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3845.7999999999997s)]
*  of and to see if you can regulate that because it's not necessarily for the best, even if it [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3851.7999999999997s)]
*  might be associated with the willingness to take responsibility. Yeah, I think it just comes from [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3858.52s)]
*  having to take a lot of responsibility growing up and so you would be hyper, you know, you would have [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3863.16s)]
*  to be very stern on yourself. But I don't want to get away from shame because it's really important. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3867.8s)]
*  Well, shame is a good pointer to the good too, hypothetically, because you could ask yourself, [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3873.96s)]
*  um, well, what am I ashamed about? What is shame? What should I do about it? Those are all good [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3879.8799999999997s)]
*  questions. Maybe you can dispense with the shame that's excessive. But if you're ashamed, well, [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3888.7599999999998s)]
*  does that mean that you did something wrong? Well, if it does, that means that there's such a thing [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3896.04s)]
*  as doing something wrong. That seems to imply that there's such a thing as wrong. That seems [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3901.72s)]
*  to imply that there's such a thing as right. And so shame in principle can also be a pathway to [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3906.84s)]
*  what is good. Say, well, if I'm engaged in something that's good, at least I won't be ashamed. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3914.36s)]
*  And that, I mean, everybody has to answer these questions for themselves, but I think that's [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3921.96s)]
*  something that's very much worth considering. What would be the case if you decided to stop [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3927.48s)]
*  engaging in all those actions that made you ashamed? [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3932.44s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. No, it's good. And it's nice to think that shame can be a direction and anything can [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3938.36s)]
*  be a direction that could lead us then to the reverse, which is like, yeah, if something is [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3944.04s)]
*  wrong, then there must be something that that's right. And so it's the best evidence for some, [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3949.64s)]
*  it's the best evidence that I know of for, for something that's right. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3954.36s)]
*  Right. Like it's, it, you can, you can find people who will debate the existence of [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3958.68s)]
*  the, the true or the good. They're cynical and they're nihilistic, let's say. They're not naive. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3965.32s)]
*  Maybe that's their advantage, but it's very rare to find someone who doesn't believe that there's [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3971.88s)]
*  such a thing as what's wrong. And so, and untrue. And so that's a good starting point. It's like, [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3976.12s)]
*  if you want to discover what's right, you can first discover more easily, discover what's wrong. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3984.68s)]
*  Look, I think that's partly why we like anti-heroes in, in movies and in fiction. You know, [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3991.0s)]
*  what's the purpose of a dark character? Well, he shines a light on what the reverse is. And [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=3996.9199999999996s)]
*  sometimes that's very powerful in the Batman series. For example, the Joker generally was, [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4003.0s)]
*  was a better bad character than Batman was a good character. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4009.3199999999997s)]
*  He was more realistic and more thought provoking. Yeah. Yeah. There was more, [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4015.8799999999997s)]
*  I don't want to say more depth there, but there was more depth there. There was more like examine. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4023.3199999999997s)]
*  Well, I think it's partly because the Joker, especially Heath Ledger's version, [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4028.2799999999997s)]
*  was pretty realistically evil in a psychological sense, whereas Batman, well, he's a, he's a, [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4033.0s)]
*  he's a vigilante. And yeah, whereas being a vigilante might be, you know, one pale reflection [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4041.16s)]
*  of what the good is because it requires courage and, and, and is involved with justice. It's still [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4048.8399999999997s)]
*  a pretty pale reflection of what the good is. So I do think that sometimes you go ahead. Sorry, doctor. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4054.9199999999996s)]
*  No, no, you, you had a thought. I'd like to hear it. I sometimes think maybe that's why it's almost [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4062.2s)]
*  interesting to be the Joker in the world sometimes to be, to, to delve in that turmoil of, of the [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4067.7999999999997s)]
*  darkness and stuff, because it's a more complex character in some ways, there's almost some appeal [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4075.0s)]
*  to it. Well, you know, there's a notion derived from the psychology, psychological theories put [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4081.0s)]
*  forth by Carl Jung and, and, and he derived some of this from Nietzsche, a philosopher, and Nietzsche [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4089.08s)]
*  famously claimed that most morality was not morality, but cowardice. It was merely the fear [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4097.32s)]
*  of getting caught or the, or the fear of public humiliation, something like that. That's what keeps [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4104.5199999999995s)]
*  you in line. So then if there's a riot and there's no police around, you're perfectly happy to throw [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4110.5199999999995s)]
*  rock through the window because the probability of getting caught declines precipitously. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4115.24s)]
*  So, and then if your morality is all persona, so for Jung, a morality that was nothing but conformity [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4120.44s)]
*  and adherence to social norms and fear, sort of a narrow constrained, I'll never dare to do anything [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4130.5199999999995s)]
*  wrong and therefore I'm good. That wasn't, that wasn't good at all. And we have a lot of that [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4137.639999999999s)]
*  these days. Yes, definitely, definitely. And so under those conditions, if, if you're nothing [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4142.92s)]
*  but a persona and so you're an obedient coward, let's say, then your dark side is actually the [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4149.72s)]
*  pathway to salvation because it's what breaks out. Yes, precisely. It's what breaks that, that [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4158.2s)]
*  tawdry, banal morality into pieces and leads you forward. That's crazy. So sometimes you need the [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4166.04s)]
*  dark side to even see what's going on on the, ah, it's tricky. It's very, very frequently the case. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4173.639999999999s)]
*  And I mean, it's, it's a, it's an axiom of Jungian psychotherapy that the pathway to development is [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4181.799999999999s)]
*  through the shadow. So for example, you might have somebody in your clinical practice who's [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4188.12s)]
*  been raised by, by extremely conservative and religious parents, which I'm not criticizing, [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4195.639999999999s)]
*  by the way, but you know, they're 27 years old and still a virgin. Now, look, there's utility and [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4201.08s)]
*  fidelity and promiscuity isn't a plus, but it might be that if you're still a virgin at the age of 27, [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4210.2s)]
*  that it's necessary for you to investigate your lust in order to progress past your [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4217.8s)]
*  mere childlike obedience. Right, right. Yeah. Because you may have some hang up there. That's [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4226.44s)]
*  even preventing you from engaging and getting settled down, you know? Oh, you know, likelihood, [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4232.04s)]
*  because for example, if you're terrified of that, then perhaps you're not very good at [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4238.12s)]
*  that. Um, sophisticated sexual suggestion like flirtation. And so then you're nowhere near as [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4242.599999999999s)]
*  attractive as you might be. So no one is going to be, you know, interested in you as a potential [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4248.92s)]
*  mate. Yeah. You know, and you might also see someone who prides themselves, for example, [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4253.8s)]
*  on never getting angry. Maybe they had an overbearing father who was angry all the time. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4260.12s)]
*  I never get angry. Well, that person is constantly being pushed around by his or her boss at work. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4264.04s)]
*  And maybe his wife or husband, his or her wife or husband. Um, and that, that I'm too good to be [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4270.04s)]
*  angry persona is stopping them from manifesting the aggression necessary to even tell the truth [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4279.16s)]
*  about their situation. So there's so many boxes and places we can put ourselves. We have to be [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4286.12s)]
*  careful. Everything is kind of a little bit of a trap sometimes. Yeah. Well, that [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4292.84s)]
*  that's why we pay attention to being bored, I suppose, to some degree, you know, that's a [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4300.44s)]
*  sign too, that the box has got a little bit too tight. Yeah. And then you need to make [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4305.08s)]
*  arrangements with the part of you that can break things because things need to be broken, just like [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4311.48s)]
*  they need to be fixed and something that's old and, and, and, and ready to fall down sometimes [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4316.76s)]
*  needs to be leveled before something new can come along. Look, there's nothing more obvious in the [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4323.08s)]
*  world today than the fact that you might need help. And I know, I know I need help cause I get [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4327.88s)]

*  or you could ask a little Daniel over there for some information. And you know, he's over there. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4346.4400000000005s)]

*  I was going to see my friend Chris Dill. Yeah. Yeah. It's about a year and a half ago and I was [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4375.72s)]

*  you know, it was just natural and I wasn't doing well and I needed some help. So I pulled over on [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4387.64s)]

*  So lucky to have him. You know, one of the things I learned from reading Nietzsche was [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4557.88s)]
*  again in relationship to morality is that a man, for example, someone who is incapable of violence [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4564.04s)]
*  is not moral because they keep it under control. Right. Right? Because they're not doing anything. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4572.44s)]
*  That's right. They don't have the capacity. It's like, well, I wouldn't engage in a fist fight. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4578.92s)]
*  Well, yeah, that's because you'd be right precisely. And I can parade that as my moral virtue. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4582.92s)]
*  I'm nonviolent. I'm nonaggressive. And this is completely independent of the morality of violence [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4589.0s)]
*  or aggression. You know, I mean, obviously we think it's moral in cases of self-defense. And so [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4594.5199999999995s)]
*  it has its necessary place. But you have to ask yourself all the time is like, are you law abiding [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4600.12s)]
*  or are you just conventional and cowardly? Yeah. Dang, man. More questions you got to ask ourselves. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4607.88s)]
*  We got to ask ourselves questions. I think that's just such a big thing. We have to like [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4615.08s)]
*  people, we have to learn to get into places and ask ourselves questions and really come up with [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4620.360000000001s)]
*  some answers. And one thing I noticed is the habit of it gets, it helps you fine tune the practice of [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4625.160000000001s)]
*  it. Just even the practice of it helps you fine tune the ability to do it. Because at first it [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4631.64s)]
*  feels very impossible when you first start asking yourself questions to really think you're going to [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4636.92s)]
*  get somewhere and get answers. Yeah. Well, to begin with, you don't necessarily get, [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4641.32s)]
*  you don't get going very quickly. Right. Right. And that's again, you have to have some patience [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4646.28s)]
*  with yourself when you first take those stumbling steps. You said that since we've talked last that, [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4651.88s)]
*  you know, your life has progressed positively. Is that the case? Yeah. Yeah. Yes, it is. And so [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4658.92s)]
*  what, to what do you, to what do you attribute that? What have you been doing right? Or what have [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4664.28s)]
*  you been doing wrong? Less? Well, one thing that's helped me, I think is just, I've had more exposure [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4668.92s)]
*  to people that are more capable in a lot of different fields than myself. So I think that's [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4676.6s)]
*  made part of me want to rise to the occasion a little bit more, not to be equals to them or [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4683.56s)]
*  anything, but just to, it's made me a little more worldly, I think in some ways. In other ways, [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4689.8s)]
*  my brother made me promise I would go to therapy even if I didn't want to. So that's made me have [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4696.28s)]
*  to like commit to going and speaking to a therapist every week. So that makes me have to just talk [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4702.92s)]
*  about stuff a little more. And I think slowly in some of those moments I've had to like, [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4710.679999999999s)]
*  you know, I've had moments where if I'm really feeling something, I'll kind of ask myself, [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4716.679999999999s)]
*  what am I feeling right now? Like, am I feeling sad? Am I feeling disappointed? Am I feeling [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4721.64s)]
*  dejected? Am I feeling tired? You know, I just start to really kind of like, it's almost like [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4727.64s)]
*  using a metal detector over my feelings when I ask questions. And then sometimes one of the words [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4733.4800000000005s)]
*  will kind of spark up and be like, okay, I'm feeling dejected. And then why, who's making [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4738.76s)]
*  you feel dejected? What's making you feel dejected? It's almost like I'm like Sherlock Holmes, but [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4745.88s)]
*  I'm the crime scene. Yeah, that's perfect. That's perfect. Well, that is exactly that process by [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4751.56s)]
*  which knowledge emerges that I was referring to before. It's like you have an emotion, but you [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4760.04s)]
*  don't even necessarily know what it is. Yeah, it's just a clue. It's like bubbles that come up in a [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4766.04s)]
*  river or bubbles that come up in a lake. Right. And sometimes there's a monster down there, dude, [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4770.4400000000005s)]
*  and that gets scary when you start to really get some of the answers. You're like, oh my God. And [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4775.56s)]
*  some of them will make me just sometimes break down crying because it'll be such a real unearthing [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4780.36s)]
*  of something that I didn't know was going on inside of me. Yes. Well, that's another reason why people [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4786.12s)]
*  don't look is that there's a monster in the depths and that metaphor of the bubbles, that's [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4791.799999999999s)]
*  a perfect symbolic representation. The depth, because look, you can't see what's in the depth. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4798.759999999999s)]
*  So the depth is what's unknown and something lurks in the unknown. And when emotions arise, [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4805.64s)]
*  as you mentioned, it's a manifestation of something that's underneath. You can see this in, [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4812.92s)]
*  you see this very clearly in intimate relationships, you know, where [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4817.8s)]
*  one person will get annoyed at the other for some minor transgression and soon they'll be [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4822.68s)]
*  fighting about something that happened or didn't happen 10 years ago. And then they'll get to the [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4826.84s)]
*  point where they're investigating the structure of the entire relationship. And then that'll stop [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4830.84s)]
*  people from ever having a dispute at all, because they're so terrified that any pathway into a [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4835.96s)]
*  dispute will lead down into, you know, is this relationship worthwhile? That's actually part of [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4841.64s)]
*  the reason I think that it's useful to have divorce difficult, if not forbidden, because otherwise [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4846.92s)]
*  that question, it's like, do you really want to be tortured by that question for the rest of your [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4855.8s)]
*  life? At some point, it's nice to just say, well, I'm not going to go there. That's off the table. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4859.88s)]
*  Yeah. I wanted to, we talked a little bit about shame and I wanted to kind of take it into a [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4865.88s)]
*  different direction. And, you know, I feel a lot, I've kind of felt some shame. Like I don't feel [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4873.08s)]
*  ashamed of my country. Like I live in the United States and I don't feel ashamed of my country, [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4881.32s)]
*  but I feel like more recently there's been, like I'm supposed to feel ashamed of my country. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4886.52s)]
*  Like I know like the Olympics is going to be coming up sometime. I don't know when, [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4894.68s)]
*  but I know it keeps coming up. And it's like, if I cheer for America, it almost feels these days in [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4898.4400000000005s)]
*  America, like you're wrong. And it seems like there's a ton of animosity and resentment [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4904.6s)]
*  from Americans, but who are enjoying like the comfort and the privileges and the opportunities [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4912.5199999999995s)]
*  of America towards America and towards like its history and stuff. But like if we didn't have the [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4920.12s)]
*  battles and we didn't have like the social revolutions that have happened in America over [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4928.84s)]
*  time, you know, then half of the world would still be enslaved and, you know, there'd be a lot less [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4933.48s)]
*  opportunity for all types of people and all types of genders and everything. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4942.04s)]
*  So it just feels like such a weird time. There's like a lot of shame being cast on people in America [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4947.08s)]
*  for, I think, supporting like a traditional idea of America maybe. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4955.8s)]
*  Yeah, I think you're dead on with all those observations and especially with regards to [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4961.64s)]
*  the sort of questioning attitude you have towards it. It's like, well, look, let's see if we can [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4967.08s)]
*  sort that through a little bit. All right. Well, there's some real complex existential problems [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4971.64s)]
*  there because you pointed out, well, with any complicated nation, there's the bloody history [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4979.0s)]
*  and the accomplishments. And the question is, well, what do you make of the relationship between the [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4987.16s)]
*  bloody history and the accomplishments? And it's complicated. So you're cursed and blessed by your [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4991.96s)]
*  history. Right. And what's the right attitude? Well, okay, let's look at patriotism for a minute. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=4997.96s)]
*  Now, in principle, pride is a sin. And I think the reason for that's more like arrogance. And [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5005.96s)]
*  arrogance is a sin because an arrogant person is convinced that they're absolutely right. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5013.96s)]
*  And that can make you a tyrant to other people, but also to yourself. It makes it very difficult [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5021.24s)]
*  for you to learn, for example. And so you might say, well, I'm a patriot. And then if you [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5025.799999999999s)]
*  criticize that, you could say, well, that's a sin of pride and look at the bloody history of your [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5031.96s)]
*  nation and how dare you be proud of that. And it's not easy to figure out how to argue your way out [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5037.5599999999995s)]
*  of that. But by the same token, to have no affinity for your community and your country [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5045.08s)]
*  also seems to lead you places that aren't particularly good. So it seems to me that [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5053.88s)]
*  one attitude you could have towards your country is gratitude. That's not pride exactly. Right. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5060.68s)]
*  That's so you could be a patriot of gratitude and you could say, well, look, man, I go outside [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5068.44s)]
*  and hey, look, there's a highway and there's a bridge and there's a school and a university. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5074.84s)]
*  And I didn't make these things. And I can walk down the street without fear of like mass thugs [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5080.68s)]
*  most of the time. And I can pursue what I want, at least compared to people throughout history. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5088.4400000000005s)]
*  Right. A lot of opportunity. Yeah. And a lot of security, a lot of security. I mean, [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5096.76s)]
*  the probability that a person who isn't involved in criminal activity is going to be the [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5103.4800000000005s)]
*  victim of a violent crime is extremely low. So, and far more than at any other point in history. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5109.88s)]
*  And so I think you can save you from animals like animals used to attack people all the time, [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5117.56s)]
*  but they don't even that hardly even happens anymore here. Yes. Well, there were way back when [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5122.28s)]
*  this is millions of years ago, there was a cat in Africa that had two large teeth in the front and [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5129.64s)]
*  one large tooth on the bottom that exactly fit over a hominid skull. Oh, yes. And bro. Yeah, [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5136.68s)]
*  right. Absolutely. And it turns out that we're not eaten by many of those anymore. And the problem, [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5144.200000000001s)]
*  right. And, you know, we've kind of dealt with the predator problem to the point where we actually [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5150.92s)]
*  feel sorry for the predators. You know, maybe we want a few more wolves and a couple of lions and [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5156.52s)]
*  tigers, which is easy to say if they're not eating your children at the time. But right. So it seems [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5161.88s)]
*  to me that, you know, security, we're definitely secure. We are definite. Well, comparatively [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5167.88s)]
*  speaking, and for sure, you compare us to the rest of humanity in the past and the rest of humanity [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5174.4400000000005s)]
*  at present. It's like, you can be grateful for all those things. And still, so look, when you're a kid, [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5180.280000000001s)]
*  you kind of have a naive patriotism, the same way that you have naive trust. When you're a kid, [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5186.92s)]
*  as long as no one's abused you, you kind of trust everybody. And, but that's not really trust, you [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5193.8s)]
*  know, it's, it's not trust in the sophisticated sense. Trust in the sophisticated sense is more [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5199.88s)]
*  like, look, I know that you're as full of snakes as me. And that if I enter into a relationship [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5206.120000000001s)]
*  with you, there's a possibility of deceit and betrayal. But I'm going to put an honest foot [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5213.08s)]
*  forward anyways, and take you at your word, partly because that's an encouragement for you to manifest [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5218.36s)]
*  your best. And hopefully you'll do that with me. And so that's an act of courage that makes the [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5224.68s)]
*  world better. And you still might get stabbed in the back for doing it. But you're not a fool under [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5229.72s)]
*  those conditions. You've taken a calculated risk. And I would say the same thing about patriotism. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5235.8s)]
*  It's like when you're a kid, you know, you're, you, you, you stand up when the American flag [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5241.24s)]
*  shows and you sing and you're, you're an unquestioning participant in that. And then maybe [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5247.719999999999s)]
*  when you're an adolescent, you start to learn about the sorrier elements of history. And that takes a [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5253.4s)]
*  hit. But then maybe you get beyond that. And you think, yes, well, human history is a complete [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5259.16s)]
*  bloody nightmare. It's a bloody tragedy. It's a, it's a catastrophe. But [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5264.36s)]
*  I'm still look at all the things that have been produced as a consequence. And you're grateful [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5270.759999999999s)]
*  for that. And, and that's a more mature form of courage, I would say, rather than the unthinking [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5276.5199999999995s)]
*  patriotism, or unthinking anti patriotism, for that matter, it's discerning gratitude. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5285.32s)]
*  Right. And I think you can be discerningly grateful for what the US has to offer. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5292.68s)]
*  And if you're not moving away, that's sort of evidence that you feel the same way. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5298.28s)]
*  Yeah. Well, sometimes I think a lot of people would like to move away, but there's just nowhere [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5304.04s)]
*  left to move. You know, I think a lot of people sometimes would love to start a new country or [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5309.4s)]
*  something, but they just, there's nowhere left to go kind of, you know, it's good in principle, [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5314.2s)]
*  you know, I saw, I went to an Airbnb out on Vancouver in the Vancouver Island [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5319.48s)]
*  vicinity a few years ago. Oh, there you go. On one of these islands. You tried it. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5325.16s)]
*  Populated, but populated by mostly by hippies. Yeah. And we came across this couple who rented [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5328.919999999999s)]
*  this little cabin that my wife and I stayed in and they had decided to sort of go back to the land. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5336.5199999999995s)]
*  Well, they bought something that owned them because they were on this island. It was pretty [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5342.919999999999s)]
*  isolated and it could be self-sufficient, but do you know how much work it takes to make you [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5349.0s)]
*  self-sufficient? Wow. Like just keeping yourself in chickens is no simple task. It's a daily [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5355.96s)]
*  grind and that's just chickens, you know, and maybe you're trading eggs and so on. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5363.96s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. And so they were really in trouble, this couple, because [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5369.88s)]
*  they wanted to go start a new country, but they had no idea just how difficult it is to, [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5374.84s)]
*  well, to have a chicken, let's say, which is something we take for granted because it's so [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5381.08s)]
*  unbelievably simple. All these problems are solved for us. We don't even notice how difficult it was [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5384.92s)]
*  to solve them. Have you seen, there's that television show alone that was actually filmed [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5390.84s)]
*  out on Vancouver Island. Did you ever see any episodes of that show? No, no. What's its theme? [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5395.56s)]
*  They take, I think, maybe 10 people and they put them onto like an uninhabited place and they have [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5402.28s)]
*  to survive for themselves by hunting and fishing and trapping. And so it's kind of reality television, [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5409.0s)]
*  but the contestants have to film all the footage themselves, so there's no crew there. So, I mean, [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5415.24s)]
*  you have people really like killing aardvarks and ox, I mean, hunting down bears. It's pretty intense. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5420.92s)]
*  It's about as like real as I've ever seen a show get, but the first two seasons were on Vancouver [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5428.12s)]
*  Island and it looked miserable. Yeah, well, it turns out that doing things like hunting and fishing [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5436.12s)]
*  are actually incredibly difficult technical skills because animals don't like to be eaten [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5442.12s)]
*  and they're actually pretty smart. So you have to know a tremendous amount before you can manage [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5449.08s)]
*  that with any degree of success. Yeah. So patriotism, so if we're at a time... Well, [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5457.0s)]
*  what do you think about that? I mean, I think your comments about, I think the idea of patriotism is [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5465.24s)]
*  under assault because it's an oppressive culture and all of that. And there is an element of that [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5471.56s)]
*  that of course is true, but... I think, well, I liked hearing what you said, to have a gratitude, [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5478.6s)]
*  you know, to have a thankful gratitude of where we are and of the place that I'm in, [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5485.16s)]
*  to think of history in a little bit of a longer term instead of just in maybe some of the simpler [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5491.5599999999995s)]
*  terms that maybe I saw in commercials growing up and stuff like that. And just in some of the simpler [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5497.5599999999995s)]
*  terms of like saying the Pledge of Allegiance and stuff. But I really like having the feeling that [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5505.8s)]
*  everybody is on the same page, even though maybe that's just a creature comfort that I've had [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5513.64s)]
*  growing up and maybe that's changing some in America. It just used to feel like everyone [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5520.6s)]
*  was on the same page. Yes. Well, that brings us back to the technological revolution to some degree. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5526.360000000001s)]
*  You know, there does seem to be a certain amount of fragmentation of the narrative, let's say. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5534.04s)]
*  And that is unsettling, because it is... when everyone's on the same page, they're not at each [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5541.4800000000005s)]
*  other's throats. You know, and you might... you can put that down and you can say, well, that's just [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5549.24s)]
*  conformity. It's like, well, first of all, let's not get too casually critical about the idea of [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5554.28s)]
*  conformity. I cover that in chapter one. Do not casually denigrate social institutions or creative [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5561.24s)]
*  achievement. It's like, it's really hard to get everybody on the same page. And it's really hard [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5567.72s)]
*  to get everybody to conform, especially when they're doing it voluntarily. And there is not [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5573.400000000001s)]
*  much difference between that and peace. And if you don't think that that's a good thing, then [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5578.6s)]
*  you should think really hard about failed states, where no one's on the same page and you get an [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5584.6s)]
*  instant proliferation of warring gangs of armed thugs. And if you think the utopians are going to [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5589.88s)]
*  win the armed thug battle, you've got another thing coming, because they'll be the first ones [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5597.8s)]
*  on the chopping block. And so, you know, you're a comedian and an open person and not likely to have [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5603.24s)]
*  a great taste in some ways for pure conformity. And I'm someone who enjoys artistic creation and [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5612.52s)]
*  revolutionary ideas. But by the same token, I'm not someone who despises conformity. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5622.6s)]
*  Well, you said in the book, I mean, you said that we're always going to have, as humans, [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5630.92s)]
*  we're always going to be searching for revolutionary ideas. It's something that [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5634.120000000001s)]
*  is constantly the way that we've always been. And it's the way of like just a liberal way of thinking [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5637.88s)]
*  is to keep moving forward and progress and try things that are new and want to do that. But I [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5645.72s)]
*  just feel like you have to have a foundation of comfort to be able to do that from, because some [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5651.4800000000005s)]
*  of that is a luxury of being comfortable, or at least being stable enough. And to feel at all, [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5657.88s)]
*  and when things get really uncomfortable, that feels a lot scarier place to be creative from, [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5666.44s)]
*  almost. Well, the first thing we should point out is that being a conformist isn't the highest of [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5671.48s)]
*  moral virtues, but being unable to conform is worse. Now refusing to conform, that's in a [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5679.5599999999995s)]
*  different category. You might have valid reasons for, especially if you're exceptional. And, [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5686.679999999999s)]
*  you know, you could say, well, virtually everyone is exceptional in some regard, [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5691.88s)]
*  and should perhaps not be conformist there. And we could say, fine, but the rest of the 95% of them [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5697.4800000000005s)]
*  should go along with the crowd, because that's going along with peace. And we also don't ever [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5704.04s)]
*  want to confuse the inability to conform with the ability to produce revolutionary ideas. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5713.4800000000005s)]
*  Because just because you can't conform or are rejected doesn't mean you're a genius. What it [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5720.280000000001s)]
*  most likely means is that you're just incapable. And then you're going to be highly motivated to [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5726.92s)]
*  confuse your incapability with creativity. And that's not helpful. And then you pointed out [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5732.04s)]
*  something that's also very important. Just how many dimensions do you want to be exceptional on [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5738.76s)]
*  anyways? You know, you're a comedian, and you have to take substantial risk to do that. And [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5744.84s)]
*  it's quite threatening. It wouldn't be such a bad idea if the rest of your life was, [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5750.28s)]
*  well, maybe secure enough to allow you to tolerate that. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5754.92s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, to have some more sense of, yeah, like, I guess I worry on like a bigger, like, [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5759.08s)]
*  picture as a nation that, like, if we start to, like, if the fabric of some of the textile of [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5765.72s)]
*  the past, if some of the tapestry kind of, I guess, or tapestry of the past starts to come apart, [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5771.8s)]
*  like, I'm all for making new tapestry, but I just feel like I just get scared. I don't know if I [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5778.84s)]
*  feel, but it's more of fear. I get scared that if we do that, that things could just tear and [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5783.72s)]
*  I just don't know what's going to happen. I guess I'm just, I'm scared a little bit. I don't know [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5792.04s)]
*  what the future of this country that I live in looks like. And I used to feel like I had a [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5796.92s)]
*  little bit better idea, but I don't know if the idea of what I thought it looked like [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5802.36s)]
*  was just a comfort based upon, like, my skin tone and growing up with at least food in my house, [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5809.16s)]
*  you know? I, you know, some stuff like that. I just don't know if, I don't know if maybe my idea [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5818.04s)]
*  was just a luxury or something. I don't know. Do you know what I'm kind of saying a little bit? [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5823.8s)]
*  I'm just kind of scared. Yes. Well, I think that's a question. That's a question that everybody's [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5828.52s)]
*  being driven to answer, partly because there's intense moral pressure to ask yourself that [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5832.360000000001s)]
*  question, you know, to what degree was your privilege unearned? Well, there's an easy answer [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5837.96s)]
*  to that actually. Lots of it, but the same holds true with virtually everyone else. Yeah. You know, [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5843.56s)]
*  and so who's got privilege depends a lot on what group you're willing to use as a comparison. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5851.0s)]
*  Yeah. So even impoverished people in North America are rich by world standards. Yeah. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5861.16s)]
*  They're in the top 1%, generally speaking, and they're certainly in the top 1% by historical [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5872.76s)]
*  standards. The problem with hammering home the idea of undeserved privilege is that [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5878.68s)]
*  there's no one who can't be crucified on that particular cross. Right. Right. You know, [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5886.04s)]
*  unless you're born naked in the middle of a field with nothing. Yeah. Everyone is the undeserved [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5892.76s)]
*  recipient of the fruits of the past. The fact that you have a mother is a privilege. You didn't [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5899.240000000001s)]
*  earn that. And so when you say you deserve nothing because of your privilege, [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5907.72s)]
*  what makes you so sure you're not saying that to everyone for all time, in which case no one [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5914.68s)]
*  ever gets anything that they can have for their own. So it's a very dangerous game. Well, I don't [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5919.4800000000005s)]
*  see where it can end. It's not obvious because imagine each person has multiple identities. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5928.84s)]
*  That's intersectionality. We all have multiple identities. You're privileged along some of those [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5935.8s)]
*  identities and relatively speaking and less along others. So if you're young and black and female, [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5943.24s)]
*  well, you're young. Right. So that's not deserved. It's not like you earned being young. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5950.92s)]
*  And so how much- Right. There's always going to be some way. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5959.8s)]
*  There's always going to be some form of privilege in every regard. Yeah. I certainly didn't feel [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5964.52s)]
*  privileged growing up. I mean, I feel like a lot of what I've had in my life has certainly [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5968.92s)]
*  been earned. I felt disadvantaged in a lot of ways, you know, emotionally in some, there's always, [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5973.4800000000005s)]
*  yeah, I think everybody would have their own discussion, their own like, not their own [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5980.6s)]
*  parameters, but yeah, I could see how everybody would have pluses and minuses. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5985.72s)]
*  Well, that's why I think the right level of analysis is the individual, you know, and when [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5990.280000000001s)]
*  you move away from that, it gets dangerous quickly and it gets dangerous for everyone. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=5995.72s)]
*  And the reason why is the reason that you just laid out, you take any individual person, [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6001.08s)]
*  you can point to the advantages that they had. Now, look, I understand that some people, [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6007.400000000001s)]
*  I mean, I was a clinician for a long time and I saw people who had lives that were so hard that [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6012.92s)]
*  you can, you could barely even imagine it. You know, I had one client who was impaired intellectually. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6019.08s)]
*  She had, she lived with an aunt who was schizophrenic, who had an alcoholic boyfriend, [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6030.76s)]
*  who was extremely violent and also schizophrenic, who used to bother her about being possessed by [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6037.0s)]
*  Satan. She was so ashamed, ashamed that she couldn't look anyone in the eye. She would [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6042.44s)]
*  walk down the street with her hand like this, sort of bowed down because she felt so unworthy. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6051.16s)]
*  She wasn't an attractive person. She looked like a street person. So people treated her badly, [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6059.799999999999s)]
*  all things considered. Now, look, she, I saw her at this hospital that I was working at, [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6065.0s)]
*  where the inpatients were people who were in even worse shape than her. They were people so hurt [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6071.8s)]
*  that they couldn't be deinstitutionalized. And I saw her because she had decided that she wanted [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6078.2s)]
*  to take one of these institutionalized people for a walk when she was out walking her dog. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6085.64s)]
*  So despite all her catap, her catastrophes, which were plenty, you know, she could still see outside [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6091.24s)]
*  of herself to someone who had it even worse. It was really something, you know? Yeah. Well, [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6098.84s)]
*  and so this privilege game, it's like, well, look to your own privilege. And that isn't, I'm, [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6104.68s)]
*  I'm not saying that there aren't historical injustices, but of course there are many of [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6112.4400000000005s)]
*  right. There are for everyone in a lot of ways. Yes. But if we only look at the victim side of [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6120.92s)]
*  things anyway, even as a human, if I only see myself as a victim, I'm really going to have a [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6125.08s)]
*  tough time. I can see myself, I can respect that I'm a victim of some things, but if I only see [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6130.28s)]
*  myself as a victim, it's going to make the rest of my life pretty tough. I feel like, well, I know [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6135.8s)]
*  it also matters what, what it matters, what you want to do about the fact that you're a victim. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6141.0s)]
*  Do you want to take away from other people? You know, it isn't that, and that. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6147.08s)]
*  I don't know. It kind of put us on a lot of different planes here at once. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6158.68s)]
*  Oh, that's okay. Well, that was a very complicated problem. And it's one that, [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6161.88s)]
*  you know, I think is particularly relevant to your particular country at this particular time [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6165.8s)]
*  and place because the tapestry is under assault. And the thing is it's a lot easier to burn [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6171.8s)]
*  something up or to cut it up than it is to knit a new tapestry. It's really hard. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6177.96s)]
*  Has there been times, I mean, is it, is it okay where we are right now from an outsider's [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6184.12s)]
*  perspective? Is it scary, like based on like historical civilizations and stuff? Like, [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6189.64s)]
*  do you think we're in a place that is like still kind of safe judging from an outside, [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6195.8s)]
*  like, or from a, you know, I mean, you're still in Western civilization. Canada is not extremely [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6202.6s)]
*  different than the U S. Do you feel like we're in a scary place or do you feel like it's just a lot [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6206.84s)]
*  of pomp and circumstance and at the root of things, we're, we're, we're still at a very realistic place. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6213.56s)]
*  I think there are always dangers that threaten the stability of societies. I think that those [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6225.8s)]
*  dangers are real, but I think they're always there. I think that I have faith in the robustness of, [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6241.24s)]
*  say, American institutions, all things considered. It seems to me that you, your country has weathered [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6252.28s)]
*  crises of at least this magnitude and often far worse many times in the past and, [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6260.12s)]
*  and that's worked out. So I think there's reason to be alert, but not hopeless. I mean, [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6267.16s)]
*  on the broader scale, the broad scale, world scale, let's say, it's hard to make a case that [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6276.2s)]
*  things were ever better than they are now. And it's almost impossible to make the case that [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6284.44s)]
*  there was ever a time in the past where things were getting better faster than they are now. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6290.44s)]
*  So it's reasonable to assume that everyone on the planet will be out of abject poverty, [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6296.12s)]
*  as defined by the UN by the year 2030. Wow. It's have, well, it already have from 2000 to 2012. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6304.6s)]
*  And so, and that was the fastest transformation in human history by a huge margin. Yeah. I've [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6314.120000000001s)]
*  been seeing less poor people, I feel like, honestly. Well, there's, there's, there's variants [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6319.88s)]
*  because in the Western countries that the working class hasn't kept up as well as they were in the [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6325.240000000001s)]
*  60s, let's say in some ways. But globally speaking, there's lots of reasons for optimism, [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6330.36s)]
*  but it's a difficult problem to settle because there's always the possibility that any given [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6337.639999999999s)]
*  problem will get completely out of hand. You know, and that's the case that people make with regards [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6343.24s)]
*  to climate change. You know, while there's a small percentage of complete catastrophe, [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6347.88s)]
*  a small percent probability of complete catastrophe. Well, we don't know what to do with a problem like [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6353.08s)]
*  that because it's impossible to calculate how many resources you devote to something [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6358.84s)]
*  that's absolutely catastrophic, but that has a small probability of occurring. Right. Right. You [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6364.4400000000005s)]
*  know, like what if the Greenland ice sheet melts? Right. Well, then the oceans rise, you know, [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6370.2s)]
*  multiple feet and that's a catastrophe. Well, how much is it worth to stave that off? [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6375.400000000001s)]
*  It's very, very difficult to calculate. Yeah. And plus we're still, a lot of people are still [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6382.360000000001s)]
*  surviving. A lot of, I think there's still that heavy survival instinct in a lot of people where [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6386.52s)]
*  it's more of short-term survival that I don't even think it's, it's our fault for thinking that way. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6391.8s)]
*  It's just built into like our limbic system or our brain stem or something like it's hard. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6396.92s)]
*  It is. Yeah. I agree with you. It's an archetypal story. That's the apocalypse. Yeah. You know, [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6402.4400000000005s)]
*  the end of the world is always upon us. You know, I, well, go on. Sorry, doc. Well, it's because [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6409.080000000001s)]
*  things can fall apart for us completely. And they do in our own life. There's illness waiting. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6415.96s)]
*  There's death waiting. Like we, we have a built in sense that things can come to a cataclysmic end [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6421.0s)]
*  and it, and that also makes us prudent and careful and able to look at the future and first [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6427.4s)]
*  all catastrophes. But the problem is, is that we can also generate false positives and be unduly [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6433.16s)]
*  worried about things that are very unlikely to occur. Yeah. Yeah. And sometimes it's like some [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6438.68s)]
*  people will start to become unduly worried about things that they don't even know if they can [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6444.6s)]
*  occur. It, that even becomes an addiction for some people. Like they're just addicted to problems, [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6448.52s)]
*  you know, like, um, I noticed that a lot, like people are just addicted to problems, uh, [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6453.240000000001s)]
*  especially on social media in the, in the U S and, and, and I had a question about social media. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6459.0s)]
*  Sometimes I feel like tech is like the new fossil fuel kind of, um, like, like bandwidth is like the [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6464.52s)]
*  new oil and like YouTube is like the pipelines and like, um, you know, like wifi is kind of like [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6471.08s)]
*  this, is this natural gas. Like it's all kind of, um, I don't know. There's like these platforms [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6478.28s)]
*  that we need to be able to survive these days. Um, you mean they become part of the infrastructure, [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6484.76s)]
*  right? They've become huge parts of the infrastructure, especially in communication. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6490.44s)]
*  Um, and communication has become one of the main, uh, I mean, especially even since we talked last, [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6495.400000000001s)]
*  like last time we spoke, you were talking about how, um, video and, uh, podcasting has become such [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6503.24s)]
*  a new form of communication, how people are using it. And the platforms that we're on are now like [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6509.08s)]
*  even probably twice as popular as they were two years ago when we spoke. Um, so I, sometimes I [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6514.84s)]
*  find for myself, like I get afraid to kind of speak up and even ask questions like on, on, [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6522.52s)]
*  on my podcast and, and to talk about certain topics because I'm afraid of being, um, de-platformed, [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6527.96s)]
*  like the platform can be taken away and they never, I just wonder, have they ever had that in history? [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6534.6s)]
*  Like in the past, like, you know, people, you, you might, you, you might not be afraid to write [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6540.4400000000005s)]
*  something because no one was going to take away the trees to make the paper, you know? Um, but now [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6546.36s)]
*  it feels like if you don't, and I may be wrong, but I feel sometimes like if I don't say the right, [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6552.839999999999s)]
*  not say the right thing, but if I don't evade certain conversations and raise my hand and ask [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6560.04s)]
*  certain questions that if, that if I do do those things, sorry, that they could take away the [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6565.48s)]
*  forest, they could take away the, the paper, the YouTube, the Instagram, they can take away the [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6571.24s)]
*  platform where we basically has become our English language kind of in a lot of ways. [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6576.28s)]
*  Well, you know, I mean, in societies that weren't free, and that would be most societies, [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6583.48s)]
*  the probability that your voice could be taken away was very high because you could just be [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6589.88s)]
*  killed or imprisoned. Wow. And I suppose all things considered, it's better to have your [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6594.52s)]
*  YouTube channel shut down than to be imprisoned or killed, right? Right. It is in, it is new, I, [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6600.6s)]
*  I suppose in that we're dependent on these technology companies increasingly dependent [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6607.64s)]
*  for our interpersonal communication. Um, I don't feel like the fear that you're describing is [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6612.68s)]
*  unwarranted. I certainly feel the same way about my podcast and YouTube channel is I've had guests [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6619.0s)]
*  on recently where I've been extremely uncomfortable talking about the topics that we've been talking [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6625.8s)]
*  about. Um, and I think reasonably so, uh, you can face de platforming or worse, they can just shut [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6631.08s)]
*  you down completely. And it's arbitrary and very, very complicated and costly and hard on you. And, [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6641.32s)]
*  and then there's the constant probability of being swarmed on social media, which is [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6647.5599999999995s)]
*  in some ways a new phenomenon, partly because of the sheer volume of it and, and the degree of [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6655.64s)]
*  exposure. So there are reasons to tread carefully. That's for sure. And it is quite terrifying. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6661.72s)]
*  No doubt about it. Have you run into trouble with your podcast? No, I haven't run into trouble. I [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6670.04s)]
*  think a lot of it for me has just been fear. Um, you know, I had on, uh, Robert F Kennedy, [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6676.12s)]
*  who's a friend of mine and he's not an anti-vaxxer, but he is a lot more about safe vaccines and [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6683.08s)]
*  making sure that vaccines have been tested properly. And he's an environmentalist, you know, [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6688.92s)]
*  since he was a child. And so it makes sense that he, you know, he cares about the environment [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6694.84s)]
*  around us and the one that's in our veins, you know, going into our bodies. He's just an overall [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6699.32s)]
*  environmentalist man. But, um, but I know he was, his Instagram was taken away for being, [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6703.56s)]
*  I don't know if he was anti-vaxx, but certainly for like bringing up a lot of topics and, and [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6710.4400000000005s)]
*  questions about vaccinations. Um, so I don't know, I guess I just see it happening sometimes. And so [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6715.160000000001s)]
*  I just get, I just get worried. I just get like, um, you know, I just wonder, has there ever been [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6721.160000000001s)]
*  a time and place in history, but I guess you answered it that some people used to be killed [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6728.04s)]
*  for being, for saying what they wanted to say. Oh, that was the norm. Like free, free expression [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6732.84s)]
*  is, that's not common. But do you worry that we're like kind of cornering any of our freedom of [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6738.360000000001s)]
*  speech or anything? Or am I just, just scared? Well, I worry enough about it so that it scares [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6745.0s)]
*  me to talk about certain things. And it isn't obvious to me that that's for the best. I don't [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6753.16s)]
*  think your fear is unwarranted. I also think that freedom of speech is sufficiently threatening [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6759.0s)]
*  so that the probability that it will be curtailed is always high and, and that we have to, [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6767.48s)]
*  what is it? The price of freedom is eternal vigilance. I think I've got that right. I don't [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6776.04s)]
*  remember who I said it, but who said it, but, and then, so you might think, well, what should you [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6779.96s)]
*  talk about and what shouldn't you? And I think that depends to a large degree on your conscience. [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6786.44s)]
*  You know, if you're interested in something, you're trying to figure it out. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6792.759999999999s)]
*  If you thwart that, then you thwart the part of yourself that's interested in things and trying [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6798.44s)]
*  to figure them out. And I can't see that's for the best for anyone. And I do believe that all [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6802.44s)]
*  things considered, free speech is a lesser evil than constrained speech because someone has to [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6807.879999999999s)]
*  decide what the content of the speech is going to be. And it's, I don't see that we should give [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6814.12s)]
*  that power over to someone lightly, no matter who they are, partly because things change too, [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6820.2s)]
*  just because something happened to be the case a year ago, doesn't mean that it's the right [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6828.44s)]
*  solution now. And so we, we have to engage in these sorts of discussions to keep everything up [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6832.04s)]
*  to date. You know, there's conformity and that's back to rule one. There's conformity in social [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6839.64s)]
*  institutions. Hooray. Abide by them, but the underlying environment shifts around. And so [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6845.4800000000005s)]
*  sometimes the traditions of the past are no longer functional and have to be updated. [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6853.96s)]
*  And the only way we can figure out when that's going to happen is by communicating about it. And [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6858.68s)]
*  so you don't want to constrain that because we all end up out of date and, [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6863.8s)]
*  and paralyzed. Yeah. So, yeah, I think there's a feeling of maybe a fear of like [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6867.88s)]
*  paralyzation or something. I guess it's not as much a reality now that I think more about it [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6873.48s)]
*  as much as it is just kind of a fear, but also a fear to speak up. So I think I just feel afraid [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6877.72s)]
*  to talk about things sometimes, or to even raise my hand and ask questions because of things I've [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6884.36s)]
*  seen of people being, you know, D platform. Certainly more like that than it was. Yes, [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6890.92s)]
*  it's certainly more like that than it was 10 years ago or 20 years ago. I certainly feel that [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6895.88s)]
*  way much more. So that's not what happens in history when that happens. Is that, does things [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6900.68s)]
*  usually like, uh, work out? Okay. I guess so. Cause we're here. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6905.64s)]
*  That's what we hope for. I guess it depends on whether or not we let the fear stop us. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6915.16s)]
*  Yeah. Right. And if enough people let the fear stop us, then that won't be good. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6919.88s)]
*  So we'll try not to do that and hope that suffices. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6926.04s)]
*  Yeah, I'm going to try not to do that. Um, I had a question about, um, so I notice, uh, [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6931.96s)]
*  whenever I was young growing up, like, um, I was thinking about like my first kiss when I was [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6938.84s)]
*  growing up, you know, when I was a kid and, and, um, and I noticed as I get older and get involved [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6944.84s)]
*  with women and that sometimes I, I, I, I feel like I spend so much time trying to kind of recreate [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6951.48s)]
*  the initial moments that I had, like the, that initial kiss moment that I had, you know, [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6959.799999999999s)]
*  like I remember my first kiss, like when I was moving towards her face, I just remember feeling [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6964.759999999999s)]
*  like, like the ships were crossing the Troy and I remember feeling like, you know, like Sparta and [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6968.839999999999s)]
*  just like, you know, like Denzel Washington was there, like everything was going on inside of my [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6975.16s)]
*  body. You know, it was like every, the whole, like, you know, the, like everything was there, [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6980.36s)]
*  you know, the grand Canyon was there and everything was there in this moment, like watching me just [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6986.36s)]
*  being a part, like it was in my skin waiting to see if I could land this kiss with this girl. And [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6991.08s)]
*  I think I've romanticized sometimes like moments like that in my, in my future that I'll never be [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=6997.08s)]
*  able to get back to those moments, you know, like, um, that was great. Look, like I still chase that [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7005.08s)]
*  high. I still chase that novelty. You know what I'm saying? Like even now and no moment now will [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7010.28s)]
*  ever live up to those initial moments, but sometimes I'm obsessed with the feelings that were in the, [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7015.8s)]
*  the novelty of youth. And it's like, I'm constantly trying to recreate those and nothing ever [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7021.4s)]
*  suffices. And so everything sometimes feels like a little bit of a exhale. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7029.96s)]
*  Mm hmm. Yeah. Well, I wrote about that in two chapters in, in Beyond Order in, [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7035.24s)]
*  it's rule eight, I believe, which is make one room in your house as beautiful, in your home as [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7042.12s)]
*  beautiful as possible. And rule 10, which is plan and work diligently to maintain the romance in [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7046.04s)]
*  your relationship. And both of them focus to some degree on the nature of the experience that you [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7052.76s)]
*  just described. You know, there's a certain pristine, um, there's a pristine and transcendent [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7061.24s)]
*  reality to experiences of, of being in love and experiences that are associated with childhood [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7071.0s)]
*  before everything becomes stale with repetition. Yeah. And part of the question of life is to how [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7078.28s)]
*  to rekindle that so that, so that you can, and it's even associated with what we were talking [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7084.5199999999995s)]
*  about earlier, which is that nostalgia for more primitive conditions. Um, I, in, in rule eight, [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7090.6s)]
*  I suggested that people cultivate a relationship with beauty because that is one way of inviting [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7097.64s)]
*  that, that feeling of awe. I mean, I think you did such a great job of describing how significant [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7104.280000000001s)]
*  that first kiss was, you know, Oh yeah. Even Tarzan was there now that I think about it. [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7111.64s)]
*  What's that? Even Tarzan was there now that I think about it. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7116.92s)]
*  Right, right. Well, all, all romance, all the, the romantic tropes, all the movies focus on exactly [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7120.2s)]
*  that experience. You know, can you recreate that within the confines of an ongoing relationship? [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7126.679999999999s)]
*  Well, it takes a tremendous amount of effort. It's not, that's the thing about youth is you get these [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7133.08s)]
*  gifts, right? When you're older, you have to work at it, but it's worth working at. And you can, [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7138.599999999999s)]
*  you can set up romance in a permanent relationship that can be extraordinarily intense if you're, [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7146.68s)]
*  if you want that and if you're willing to work for it and it's worth it because otherwise you [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7154.200000000001s)]
*  abandon it and that's not good. And the same goes for beauty. One of the great things that artists [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7159.56s)]
*  do is remind us of what's right in front of us, because as you get older, what you see is more [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7164.84s)]
*  and more memory and less and less of the thing itself. And an artist comes along, if he's a real [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7171.32s)]
*  artist just wax you on the side of the head and says, no, look at it this way. And you look at [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7176.599999999999s)]
*  it that way and you think, oh yes, that's now I remember. Yeah. And yeah, like chapter, go ahead. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7182.599999999999s)]
*  Sorry. And I haven't gotten to eight and 10. I'm stuck. I'm stuck in three. I'm not, I didn't mean [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7189.88s)]
*  to be, but there's a lot of big word. You gotta be it to tie. It takes a little time. Hey, no [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7194.92s)]
*  problem. I like chapter eight, I think better than any of the other chapters because it does [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7200.92s)]
*  concentrate on this experience of youth and the ability to be immersed so completely that's [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7207.08s)]
*  characteristic of childhood and does, there's an idea, you know, that the kingdom of heaven is [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7216.36s)]
*  something that's already inhabited by children, right? Unless you become as little children, [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7224.04s)]
*  you'll know, you'll know in no wise enter the kingdom of heaven. And that is a, it's a poetic [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7229.4s)]
*  echo of the fact that those experiences are possible, but with effort and discipline and aim, [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7235.16s)]
*  you can reduplicate them at least to some degree in your adult life. And that's definitely worth [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7242.2s)]
*  that. That can be worth the effort, especially if you find yourself longing for it. Yeah. Yeah. A [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7249.08s)]
*  lot of, I mean, even I remember after our last conversation, a lot of things come down to effort [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7255.24s)]
*  really, and really living, you know, effortly living, you know, cause living after a while, [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7259.4s)]
*  it becomes sometimes, especially in this, in our country that you're kind of floating in a, [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7267.5599999999995s)]
*  you know, in a little bit of a cushy river kind of, you know? So I think, yeah, if you really want to [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7274.76s)]
*  live, if you really want to challenge your soul and get into whatever's in you, [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7280.44s)]
*  or experience anything, experience some things more than the gratis that is kind of like [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7285.24s)]
*  cloaked on us each day in America, then you have to really make an effort. [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7295.639999999999s)]
*  One of the things I noticed that's relevant to that, [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7300.92s)]
*  I think you need a meaning to sustain you in life, because life is difficult, and so the meaning has [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7309.08s)]
*  to be proportional to the difficulty. I think everyone knows that and wants that. Whenever I [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7316.12s)]
*  talk to audiences about that and pointed out that it's through the adoption of responsibility [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7325.08s)]
*  that you're most likely to encounter those meanings, the audiences would generally go silent, [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7332.76s)]
*  because that isn't an equation that's often made, right? Is that, well, you need meaning, [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7338.84s)]
*  that's better than happiness. Happiness is a consequence, I would say, a fortunate consequence [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7344.36s)]
*  of the pursuit of something deeply meaningful, but almost everything that's deeply meaningful [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7349.8s)]
*  requires the willingness to adopt responsibility. And so that's a good thing to know, because [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7355.08s)]
*  you might ask yourself, well, why should I adopt responsibility? And the answer to that seems to be [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7361.08s)]
*  something like, well, it deepens your life. Because I want meaning, I want something more. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7366.76s)]
*  No, it's a great, because I think a lot of us are swimming around thinking that something meaningful [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7371.72s)]
*  will show up. There's so much advertising and so much, this is important, this means [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7377.8s)]
*  something, this is valuable. And a lot of it is, is pyrite, man, is pyrite. [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7384.76s)]
*  Do you remember your first kiss, Dr. Peterson? Was it in Canada? [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7392.68s)]
*  Yes, it was certainly in Canada. My man. I remember the first time I held hands with my, [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7398.280000000001s)]
*  the woman who became my wife. Wow. Were you guys outdoors or indoors? [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7406.04s)]
*  It was high school graduation. And she had been a friend of mine, but that was our first date. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7410.68s)]
*  And that was an unparalleled thrill, I would say. So, but I was able to duplicate that many times [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7417.64s)]
*  in our marriage. Thank God, with her cooperation and participation, it was something we really [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7425.88s)]
*  concentrated on, making time for romance. Once you get married, romance sort of becomes number [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7433.08s)]
*  11 on a list of 10 necessities, you know, it's still up there, but it gets pushed out by [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7440.2s)]
*  everyday concerns, work and domestic responsibilities and children and all of that. [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7448.2s)]
*  You have to force it back up into the top three or four and, you know, that also stabilizes your [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7454.599999999999s)]
*  relationship across time and is good for your kids and good for you. So that's, that's worth, [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7460.679999999999s)]
*  that's worth the work. And it's really useful to know that it is work. You need, it is work. It's [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7467.88s)]
*  not just going to happen. And the fact that it isn't happening for you, it doesn't mean that [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7473.0s)]
*  there's something wrong with you. It just means that it's, it's work. You have to aim at it. [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7477.16s)]
*  You have to aim at it. Do you remember if you kind of, did you reach for your wife's hand or did she [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7484.28s)]
*  make that first initial move? Do you remember or no? Yes, I do remember actually. She took my hand. [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7489.4s)]
*  Mm hmm. That's cool, man. She was much more confident in that regard at that time than me [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7497.08s)]
*  and probably still now for that matter. I know you speak a lot about your granddaughter in your [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7503.24s)]
*  book, like not a ton, but there's a couple of moments so far that I've noticed where you'll [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7509.48s)]
*  kind of reference her or watching a child grow and some things that they learn. What, is that [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7513.08s)]
*  your first grandchild that you have now? Yes, I have another one now. I have two, but she was [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7518.92s)]
*  the first. How, has it changed any of your views of being like alive or the importance of family [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7524.76s)]
*  or just maybe just any of your, do you notice anything different in your heart or your brain? [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7535.400000000001s)]
*  Obviously there's going to be some stuff in your heart that's obvious, but has any of your? [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7541.8s)]
*  It's mostly cemented home the notion I had that there's, there's really nothing in the final [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7547.56s)]
*  analysis. There's, there's your, there's the career, your career in your family, you know, [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7553.64s)]
*  and your family is half your life or more. And I don't know what you do when you're old, if you [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7562.92s)]
*  don't have grandchildren, you know, I mean, it's not like they occupy all my time, but it would be, [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7571.400000000001s)]
*  it'd be such a hole there. Yeah. Oh, I can imagine. Yeah. Sitting there, eating soup by yourself and [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7578.2s)]
*  just doing solitaire maybe or something, you know? Well, and not being able to interact with children [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7585.16s)]
*  because children are revitalizing as well as being exhausting and frustrating and all of those things, [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7592.12s)]
*  but they are revitalizing and they're like fire. You know, if you put a two-year-old among a group [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7598.04s)]
*  of 75 year olds, the 75 year olds don't do anything but watch the two-year-old. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7603.48s)]
*  They're fascinated by, by the child and to see all that new potential coming to manifest itself. [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7608.679999999999s)]
*  I mean, those are the sorts of things that cultures tell you, you know, [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7615.879999999999s)]
*  get married, stick together. Well, why? Well, it's for the children, but that's to your benefit as [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7620.36s)]
*  well. And then it's for the grandchildren because that's to your benefit as well. It's a, it's a good [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7627.5599999999995s)]
*  long-term solution, even though it's very difficult and requires all sorts of sacrifice. And, but [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7632.2s)]
*  you lose that and you get all fractured up. And it isn't obvious to me what, what you do then when, [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7639.16s)]
*  as you age. So it's made me more aware even of the, of the great privilege of having a family that [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7644.28s)]
*  loves you and how valuable that is above everything else. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7655.8s)]
*  Yeah, that's powerful, man. And it's, I can imagine. I don't have that yet, but sometimes I feel myself [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7663.56s)]
*  like I constantly kind of feel myself coming to some of the same, like I'm in a cul-de-sac and [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7668.04s)]
*  I think sometimes it's what I'm looking for is probably a family of my own. You know, I'm actually, [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7673.64s)]
*  I've had fear about kind of taking some of those next steps, but I think [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7679.88s)]
*  some of what I am looking for is just more a sense of like, this is my tribe or this is my group or [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7682.92s)]
*  this is, I don't know, something. I can feel it kind of. [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7689.96s)]
*  Yeah. Well, if you didn't, people who felt that had children and that's how we're all here. [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7695.56s)]
*  So, yeah, it's a, it's a huge part. It's a huge part of life and it gets a bad rap. It's a response [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7703.16s)]
*  rap. It's a responsibility rap again. It's like, well, you know, can you really be with one person [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7711.72s)]
*  for the rest of your life? And is that realistic now that people live so long? And well, I don't [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7717.72s)]
*  know if it's realistic or if you can be with one person for the rest of your life, but there are [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7722.92s)]
*  definite coming up with a better alternative is no simple matter. And it's a blessing to have young [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7727.240000000001s)]
*  people around that care whether you're alive, you know, as you get older. So I wouldn't, I don't [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7735.64s)]
*  think it's a good idea to deny yourself that. So I think a real gift. Yes. Well, and you should, you [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7743.8s)]
*  know, this chapter about romance in relationships might be particularly useful to you if you're [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7751.0s)]
*  thinking about having a family, because I do believe that it's possible to keep that romantic [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7757.4800000000005s)]
*  vision alive. You have to make it a name. Like you have to really work at it. You think, well, [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7762.6s)]
*  what do I want? How would I like to have a date with my wife? Well, what would you like to see her [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7767.88s)]
*  wear? How would you like to arrange the music? You know, all of these things, people are afraid to [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7774.76s)]
*  attend to them. But if you attend to them, you can get good at it and then you can make something [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7782.200000000001s)]
*  magical. And then the magic that you can create with the same person over and over stops you from [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7788.36s)]
*  being frustrated that it's the same person because yes. So, and I think you need to know that that's [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7794.36s)]
*  possible. Yeah. Yeah, man. I think sometimes we just don't hear that kind of stuff enough, you know? [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7802.599999999999s)]
*  No, I know. I know we don't. It's a good reminder. One more question I wanted to ask you. This was [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7809.799999999999s)]
*  about, you know, I've been in recovery for like five years, I guess, and I've struggled recently [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7817.24s)]
*  in the past year during the pandemic. But I'm still a strong believer in recovery and in the 12 Steps [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7823.08s)]
*  of Recovery. Why do you feel like the 12 Steps of Recovery or the 12 Steps work well for so many [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7829.0s)]
*  people? And do you think that that's the best modality to obtain sobriety for addicts? [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7836.92s)]
*  Well, it isn't obvious that there's a good alternative. So that's the first thing. If AA [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7848.2s)]
*  doesn't work, it isn't like there's a preferable treatment. Most people cease [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7855.8s)]
*  alcohol use on their own without medical intervention. We don't know why, although [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7863.08s)]
*  religious transformation seems to be one. And of course, the 12 Steps capitalizes on that. I think [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7868.84s)]
*  that it's quite an intelligent program, psychologically speaking. You know, first of all, [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7874.44s)]
*  you have to make a moral inventory. You have to figure out what's wrong in your life, which [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7881.639999999999s)]
*  would obviously include the alcohol misuse. You have to rectify that, take responsibility for it, [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7887.400000000001s)]
*  try to chart out a new course. You're also provided with a social structure, which is really useful [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7894.2s)]
*  when you're trying to stop drinking, because it's very probable that most of your friends are going [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7901.64s)]
*  to be drinkers. And so that leaves not only do you stop drinking, but you stop associating with your [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7906.4400000000005s)]
*  friends or maybe even with your family members. That's really hard. So, you know, an AA doesn't [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7912.76s)]
*  seem to be an exploitative organization. It's all volunteers. And speaking strictly clinically, [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7919.72s)]
*  it isn't obvious that there's a better alternative. If you are being strictly scientific, [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7930.6s)]
*  you'd say, well, there's never been controlled trials of AA where you randomly assign people [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7935.320000000001s)]
*  to the AA group and to the non AA group or another treatment to see head to head, [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7941.0s)]
*  which works better. And there's the problem that many people drop out. And so you can't [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7946.68s)]
*  tell exactly what the success rate is. But that's in some sense a technical argument. [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7952.04s)]
*  It also isn't clear to me that AA does people harm, which is also really important because [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7960.44s)]
*  many medical treatments can produce harm. And so the worst you could say is, well, [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7967.08s)]
*  maybe it won't work. So yeah, and that's not that big of a risk. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7973.48s)]
*  Especially if you're already wasting. Right. Comparatively speaking, yes. [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7980.28s)]
*  Yeah. If you're already all sick or something, you know, you've been. So what do you think, [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7983.88s)]
*  what do you think it was that enabled you to stop drinking? Like why did you manage it? What did [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7989.5599999999995s)]
*  you use as an alternative? Well, I noticed when I went, well, my problem was cocaine, [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=7996.2s)]
*  but I worried that if I drank, I would do cocaine. I never had a problem drinking, [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=8002.04s)]
*  but I was worried that one could lead to the other. Yes, undoubtedly. [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=8006.04s)]
*  I think, well, one thing it gave me a place where I realized that [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=8010.92s)]
*  other people were sharing their thoughts and feelings and I'd never been in that kind of [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=8016.76s)]
*  environment before. And so to me, so that was one of the big things was the emotional sobriety. [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=8020.36s)]
*  Um, and then it helped me have a relationship with a higher power, which I'd never really had. [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=8026.84s)]
*  Right. And what difference did that make? Do you think? Oh, man, that made, [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=8034.44s)]
*  it was the first time in my life. I re I felt like something cared about me unconditionally. [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=8041.88s)]
*  And you experienced that. Oh, and I experienced at a level that shook me, man. Like I've got [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=8050.04s)]
*  electrocuted. Like it was, yeah, that a guy just that this invi that some invisible thing [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=8054.2s)]
*  cared about me at a level that I could never even imagine. And that no matter if I was good or bad, [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=8062.5199999999995s)]
*  or if I did something naughty or nice or cinnamon or spice, man, that this thing loved me. [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=8068.44s)]
*  And that was, uh, I just never felt that before. So for there to be a way to get to that feeling, [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=8075.72s)]
*  that's what made recovery feel like important to me, I think. [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=8082.36s)]
*  Yeah. Well, to have an experience like that is a real gift. Yeah. It was just, it was powerful. Um, [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=8088.5199999999995s)]
*  Dr. Peterson, I don't want to take up a ton of your time, man, but I just, I think once again, [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=8095.48s)]
*  it just reminded me that life is a program of effort, you know? Um, and if we want to see [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=8100.36s)]
*  changes and if we want to experience something different than the circle or the, even the, [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=8106.44s)]
*  the figure eight that we're in, or even the trapezoid that we're in, that we have to, [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=8112.36s)]
*  that we gotta, uh, we gotta make an effort, you know? We really gotta make it. It's good [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjEqM7USgA&t=8117.24s)]
