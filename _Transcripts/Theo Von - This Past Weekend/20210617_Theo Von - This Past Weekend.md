*  They work in a business that I know nothing about, but I'm very curious to learn. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=25.72s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=75.28s)]
*  My first time too. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=76.28s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=77.28s)]
*  Very cool spot. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=78.28s)]
*  And you've been sober ever since? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=79.28s)]
*  No, I haven't been sober ever since. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=80.28s)]
*  I've had a couple of relapses here and there. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=81.28s)]
*  Well. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=82.28s)]
*  But. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=83.28s)]
*  Every day's a work in progress. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=84.28s)]
*  It really is, dude. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=85.84s)]
*  I'm grateful to have each new day, you know, and just try to have a good attitude when [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=86.84s)]
*  I get up. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=89.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=90.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=91.04s)]
*  If I can start out decent, I usually do pretty well. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=92.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=93.4s)]
*  It's when I start out. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=94.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=95.4s)]
*  So you don't want to go have a drink with me later? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=96.4s)]
*  Probably not, man. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=97.4s)]
*  I'll watch you drink, dude. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=98.4s)]
*  I'll buy you some steroids, dude. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=99.4s)]
*  We used to do a good bit of, uh, you know, one of my buddies, one night we were, I was [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=103.08s)]
*  doing some touring somewhere and, um, he's like, he's like 3 a.m. he's like, Hey man, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=107.04s)]
*  I'm going to get some drugs, you know, give me some money. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=111.68s)]
*  And I was like, all right, you know, I'm not going out there to get them, but I'll, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=114.64s)]
*  you know what I'm saying? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=117.8s)]
*  I'll be a part of it. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=118.8s)]
*  Fiscally, I'll be involved. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=119.8s)]
*  Fiscally. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=120.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=121.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=122.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=123.8s)]
*  So I give him some money and then he comes back like two hours later, man, he had steroids [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=124.8s)]
*  on him. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=126.04s)]
*  He's like, let's party. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=127.04s)]
*  And he had injectable steroids, man. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=128.04s)]
*  I said, well, it takes two weeks to get in your system. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=130.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=133.68s)]
*  So even if we do them right now, we got to, you know, I gotta get a gym membership and [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=134.68s)]
*  then you and I got to meet back up in a couple of weeks. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=137.96s)]
*  So this wasn't a good idea. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=140.4s)]
*  So we decided not to. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=142.36s)]
*  Funny story though. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=143.36s)]
*  I'm sitting here with Cam and Spanky and you guys are auctioneer men, right? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=144.36s)]
*  That is correct. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=149.0s)]
*  And is that a safe term? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=150.0s)]
*  What is the term to reference somebody that does auction? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=151.04000000000002s)]
*  Auctioneer. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=156.04000000000002s)]
*  That's it. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=157.04000000000002s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=158.04000000000002s)]
*  The old school term would be Colonel. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=159.04000000000002s)]
*  Colonel. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=160.04000000000002s)]
*  Really? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=161.04000000000002s)]
*  In World War I, all the colonels, when they got done with all the equipment, they were [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=162.04000000000002s)]
*  the ones that sold the equipment. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=166.4s)]
*  So they labeled auctioneers as colonels. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=168.64000000000001s)]
*  Horses too. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=170.52s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=171.52s)]
*  They listened to them, so they gave them the title Colonel. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=172.68s)]
*  Just to get the men to listen to them. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=175.96s)]
*  They gave them the title Colonel, so then the men had to listen. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=178.12s)]
*  And so at the end of like a battle or something or a war or something, the Colonel would auction [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=180.32000000000002s)]
*  off the gear? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=183.88s)]
*  I think so. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=184.88s)]
*  To my understanding, yes. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=185.88s)]
*  Horses and gear, yeah. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=186.88s)]
*  So technically we are colonels. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=188.24s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=190.20000000000002s)]
*  And so. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=191.20000000000002s)]
*  Think technically. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=192.20000000000002s)]
*  And you guys, so Spanky, you got into it first. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=193.20000000000002s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=195.64000000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=196.64000000000001s)]
*  And so how did that occur? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=197.64000000000001s)]
*  How did you, how do you just, how did someone become an auctioneer? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=198.64000000000001s)]
*  It's really, it's a family passed down trait. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=203.35999999999999s)]
*  I mean. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=207.4s)]
*  It's tough to get into. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=208.4s)]
*  It's really, really tough to break into. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=209.4s)]
*  Like, like they'll tell you 5% of every graduating auctioneer class, only 5% ever pursue it and [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=211.04s)]
*  make a living at doing it. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=218.72s)]
*  And is that, and is it because it's a family business? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=221.12s)]
*  Like it's hard, you almost have to have a little bit of. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=223.96s)]
*  It's not necessarily a family business, but it's more so of, with anything, it's who you [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=224.96s)]
*  know versus what you know. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=230.72s)]
*  Correct. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=232.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=233.52s)]
*  And that's everything. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=234.52s)]
*  I mean, and even actually in, I know in Louisiana, there's a lot of barge captains and stuff [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=235.52s)]
*  like that. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=238.44s)]
*  And that business, tugboat captains. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=239.44s)]
*  And that is a familial business. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=241.96s)]
*  I mean, if you're grandfather, you can literally get grandfathered into it. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=244.12s)]
*  You know, and that's, and they're always going to court over that, over trying to like adjust [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=247.76s)]
*  the way people can get into that. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=252.6s)]
*  So Spanky, take me into how you get into it. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=254.88s)]
*  My father graduated Missouri auction school in 1974. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=257.64s)]
*  And he's, he's had auto auctions my whole life, owned auto auctions my whole life. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=262.44s)]
*  And so, I mean, I was working the ring, which they say the ring is the floor taking bids. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=267.44s)]
*  Yep, yep, yep, yep. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=273.84s)]
*  The floor bitters. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=275.35999999999996s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=276.35999999999996s)]
*  I mean, I was working the ring as young as 10, 11, 12 years old. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=277.35999999999996s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=280.35999999999996s)]
*  And when you're in the ring, what is that? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=281.35999999999996s)]
*  Like, so, so the ring is the floor where? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=282.67999999999995s)]
*  The arena and, and, and working the crowd. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=284.48s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=287.28000000000003s)]
*  Working, working the people that are attending the auction, they're buying and bidding. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=288.28000000000003s)]
*  You're taking their bids and turning them into the auctioneer. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=292.44s)]
*  Auctioneers don't want to block. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=295.48s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=297.20000000000005s)]
*  At that time would have been my dad. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=298.20000000000005s)]
*  I mean, we've done anything from tool sales to car sales. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=299.52000000000004s)]

*  that harder than being actually the big boss? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=314.28s)]
*  No, not at all. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=316.4s)]
*  You don't have to count. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=317.4s)]

*  Like how the auctioneer sets the, like the increments, how fast the crowd is bidding. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=335.59999999999997s)]

*  So if you're like 10,000 bucks, you know, you count in two fifties or hundreds. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=344.08s)]
*  And if you're like in whatever the two or three hundred bucks, it's fifties sometimes. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=348.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=352.0s)]

*  Once you get the item. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=622.96s)]
*  So they kind of, do they always wheel the item out? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=623.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=626.24s)]
*  The car will come in. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=626.72s)]
*  So it's like a huge barn with like big bay doors and there's 18 lanes. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=627.6s)]
*  There's four to 18 lanes, depending on what auction we're working. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=632.28s)]
*  And they just drive the cars through the car sits there. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=635.32s)]
*  Lanes. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=637.72s)]
*  When you say that, what does that mean? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=638.08s)]
*  I know a straight. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=639.16s)]
*  Okay. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=640.16s)]
*  So like a big garage. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=641.28s)]
*  Okay. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=642.52s)]
*  So like if you were to take this garage door and open it up over here, it just goes [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=642.88s)]
*  through auctioneers in the middle and you got the ring right there. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=646.12s)]
*  Okay. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=648.6s)]
*  And, uh, the car will roll up and it sits there for until pretty much until we find [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=649.0799999999999s)]
*  money on it, which is basically you get a bid. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=653.24s)]
*  Okay. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=655.4s)]
*  Uh, I'd say the toughest part is probably just finding the money, but it's also the [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=655.76s)]
*  easiest too, cause you can just drop it really low and go. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=658.76s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=661.4s)]
*  So a car rolls in right. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=661.7199999999999s)]
*  Mm hmm. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=663.24s)]
*  And you, do you start the bidding or the audience starts the bidding? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=664.0s)]
*  We start the bidding. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=668.56s)]
*  So we're, we look at our computer or if we have a rep next to us, uh, there'll be a [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=669.3199999999999s)]
*  reserve or a floor with that dealer needs for that car. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=673.5999999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=677.4s)]
*  So we usually started around there, give or take. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=677.68s)]
*  And then from there we find the money and then we go up and get some excitement [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=680.4s)]
*  and bids roll in. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=683.8s)]
*  Now using that beginning moment, do you see people kind of talk to their friends? [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=685.12s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=688.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=688.8399999999999s)]
*  We read people, we read people for, yeah. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=689.0s)]
*  So if you see somebody and I didn't mean to interrupt, but they're waiting for you [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=691.16s)]
*  to drop back, back, back, back, back, back. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=694.88s)]
*  And so you're fishing for money. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=697.04s)]
*  I see. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=699.64s)]
*  And so you just drop down and, and you know, numbers. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=700.4399999999999s)]
*  So who are you working for the seller or the bidders or you're working for both? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=703.28s)]
*  We're working for the auction, but we really work for the seller. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=706.6s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=708.96s)]
*  Uh, in this, because we're selling his merchandise, his inventory. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=709.28s)]
*  Do you get a percentage of the sale of what sold? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=713.16s)]
*  We wish we get flat rate day, day labor pretty much flat rate. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=715.6s)]
*  Now, if you were to put on the auction, like my grandpa owned the auction, of course [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=720.96s)]
*  he got a percent, a buy fee and a sell fee. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=724.9200000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=727.16s)]
*  So he, yeah, he would get percent. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=727.8000000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=729.48s)]
*  But as an auctioneer, we're just independent contractors. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=729.76s)]
*  Cause that makes you really wonder if you had like Bruce buffer or something in [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=732.5600000000001s)]
*  there from the UFC or something where you had, you know, it's tough, you know, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=735.24s)]
*  like if you had somebody that had that golden throat on them, it might be [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=739.44s)]
*  golden would they get a little extra? [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=743.08s)]
*  That's passion. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=745.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=746.16s)]
*  That's what I call passion. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=746.5600000000001s)]
*  I mean, that's what I do every day because I'm passionate about what I do. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=747.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=751.2s)]
*  And, uh, yes, I get paid well for doing it. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=751.92s)]
*  Uh, but I do it for the, I mean, I do it because I love to do it and it's fun. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=754.88s)]
*  It's fun. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=759.4s)]
*  It's never the same. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=759.6800000000001s)]
*  Really? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=760.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=761.08s)]
*  It's different every day. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=761.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=762.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=762.8s)]
*  So that item gets up there. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=763.04s)]
*  You got the item going. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=764.2s)]
*  Now you started to kind of lower the money enough and monitor the crowd where I [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=765.1600000000001s)]
*  guess you're taking this, you get a vibe of an audience, same as a comedian. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=768.36s)]
*  After a while, you can kind of tell where things are happening. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=771.84s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=774.12s)]
*  You're reading people. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=774.44s)]
*  You really can man. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=775.0s)]
*  And it's weird. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=775.88s)]
*  You can almost read a group of people. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=776.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=778.32s)]
*  It's you can almost feel little things of energy. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=778.84s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=780.96s)]
*  So you're reading people, you get a bid, right? [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=781.5200000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=783.5200000000001s)]
*  All right. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=783.88s)]
*  You get that first bid. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=784.12s)]
*  Then where do you go from there? [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=785.0400000000001s)]
*  Start going up. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=786.24s)]
*  Okay. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=787.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=787.5600000000001s)]
*  You look for the second one, you know, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=787.6800000000001s)]
*  and now what if people, do you notice if people are feeling too [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=789.84s)]
*  pressure, like I'm a nervous bidder, you know, so I would probably, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=792.24s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=795.0400000000001s)]
*  We read you. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=795.4000000000001s)]
*  It would be hard for me to like make that choice. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=796.1600000000001s)]
*  Do you slow down the verbiage and slow it down? [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=798.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=801.36s)]
*  Or speed it up and they get nervous in bed. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=801.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=806.2800000000001s)]
*  Do that, bro. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=806.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=807.8000000000001s)]
*  That'd be crazy, man. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=808.12s)]
*  I'll lose a damn wife like that. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=809.4000000000001s)]
*  Have you seen somebody make a bid and you always felt bad for them? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=812.32s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=815.24s)]
*  Most definitely. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=816.08s)]
*  Most definitely. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=816.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=817.24s)]
*  But we're not there to babysit. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=817.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=819.4000000000001s)]

*  We're there to sell cars. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=820.72s)]
*  We want to make sure everyone's happy, but you know, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=821.88s)]
*  I feel like if you don't piss somebody off, you're probably not doing a good job. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=824.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=827.72s)]

*  Really? [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=832.32s)]
*  From one side, you know, right. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=833.08s)]
*  One side or the other. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=834.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=835.64s)]

*  Is there a lot of, you go in there and chant every day, Betty bought her, bought [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=842.08s)]
*  some butter, but she said this butter is better if I had a bitter battery in my [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=845.4s)]
*  bit, I mean just tongue twisters all day long. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=848.64s)]
*  Learn how to burn out a breeze. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=851.72s)]
*  That would be a hard one. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=853.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=854.64s)]
*  For 10 hours a day for 10 days. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=854.96s)]

*  I've breathed my whole life, but I couldn't imagine if I had to really section [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=857.6s)]
*  it off like that, it might get a little hairy, but what about, um, take me [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=860.52s)]

*  before an auction? [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1183.0s)]
*  Like, is there kind of a series of things you go through or at this point, is it [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1183.96s)]
*  kind of just by rote kind of. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1187.12s)]
*  At this point, it's really, really natural for me and probably him too. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1189.12s)]
*  I mean, he's been doing it 10 years and I've been at, at, uh, three to six auto [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1192.72s)]

*  We, we don't know what the inventory is until it kind of rolls through the door. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1205.04s)]
*  We show up, we have a meeting and then, um, with the auction crew and the staff, [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1208.24s)]
*  and then, uh, we check our sound system and that's pretty much it. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1212.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1215.56s)]
*  Like a sound check kind of sound check and then the cars roll through and [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1216.0s)]
*  everything we need is on the screen and we just sell them. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1219.0s)]

*  What type of people are bidding on normal car dealers, just car dealers? [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1236.4s)]
*  We mainly work dealer only auto auctions. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1239.8s)]
*  Oh, so we see the same dealers. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1242.96s)]
*  So we see the same dealer. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1245.1200000000001s)]
*  So like I could show you video clips in my phone that were, I'm calling out [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1246.44s)]

*  know what they're going to do. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1271.16s)]
*  Oh, so, so when something comes in that we know they're, they have to have it. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1272.24s)]

*  Oh, interesting. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1282.68s)]
*  So if I go to like a used car lot or any type of car lot, right. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1283.6s)]
*  I bought it at an auction. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1286.76s)]
*  They probably bought it at an auction. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1288.04s)]
*  Potentially. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1289.2s)]
*  Cause I remember when I was growing up, my mom used to go to the police auction. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1290.04s)]
*  Sometimes she was dating a man that ran that own a car wash and, uh, and she [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1293.16s)]
*  would go over there sometimes a lot of times. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1300.08s)]
*  And one time I think we almost had a police car for a little while, like a [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1302.08s)]
*  used police car and, uh, they got it at the police auction. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1306.6s)]
*  That was always a big thing. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1310.32s)]
*  The police auction. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1311.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1312.36s)]
*  You know, you'd always hear about that. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1312.9199999999998s)]
*  And I guess that was cars that had been impounded or something. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1314.0s)]
*  And they were getting rid of a lot of auction drives, drive those cars [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1315.9599999999998s)]
*  because they, they can go fast. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1318.48s)]
*  Cause we travel a lot. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1320.1599999999999s)]
*  That's the main part of the job is travel. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1321.4399999999998s)]
*  That's the hardest part of our job. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1324.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1325.32s)]
*  It's getting to the job. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1325.4399999999998s)]

*  We, yeah. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1553.6399999999999s)]
*  Where does that land? [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1553.92s)]
*  The sect to me. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1554.76s)]

*  So it was at a, a gala event and, uh, yeah, it was just one of those items that they put up there. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1561.92s)]
*  I don't remember what it sold for. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1568.48s)]
*  I'm sure it was like 10,000 bucks or so, but that was, that was the craziest thing for sure. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1569.44s)]
*  Just the backstory of some wife and husband sitting there bidding on a damn, I don't [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1574.32s)]
*  want anymore. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1579.44s)]

*  Damn crazy cars too. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1590.52s)]
*  But the sect to me was definitely the, uh, for me, I think, uh, uh, one time I think me [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1592.24s)]
*  and him were working together and I think we sold it a yellow lab puppy for like 60,000. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1597.3200000000002s)]

*  No way. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1604.3200000000002s)]
*  Was that sea biscuit or whatever? [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1605.56s)]
*  Damn. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1606.92s)]
*  It was, it was an event. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1607.28s)]
*  It was a, it was a fundraiser for a medical group. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1608.64s)]
*  And I mean, it was, yeah, it was in, it was dogs, [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1612.4s)]
*  dogs go crazy at those events. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1616.16s)]
*  It was a puppy. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1617.48s)]
*  I met them. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1618.24s)]
*  Especially labs. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1619.0800000000002s)]
*  Maybe it was like a sounder part of it. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1620.2s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1621.92s)]
*  I'm that famous dog that died in that movie sounder, but damn, 60,000. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1622.44s)]
*  I think the highest priced car I've ever sold was I wasn't actually auctioneer and I [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1628.52s)]
*  was working the ring, uh, in Houston, Texas. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1632.76s)]
*  And it was a Bentley for 330,000. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1636.44s)]
*  There was a, I worked in auction in Amelia Island, Florida, classic car sale. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1640.0s)]
*  And it was a car that, uh, I think Porsche and Ferrari, one of those types of cars, [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1645.28s)]
*  they built like two of these cars together. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1651.24s)]
*  This was one. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1653.12s)]
*  It was literally a rust bucket. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1653.72s)]
*  $950,000 is what it sold for. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1655.52s)]
*  And I was working the floor, the ring, like he was in. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1659.6399999999999s)]
*  Why, why, why? [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1661.8799999999999s)]
*  I think it's just collector. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1663.0s)]
*  It was a collector. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1663.96s)]
*  I mean, they're so rare. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1664.6s)]
*  There's only a couple of them. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1665.6399999999999s)]
*  I don't know if that's it or whatever. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1666.76s)]
*  I guess, I don't know. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1668.28s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1669.52s)]
*  Well, in my situation, that $330,000 Bentley was in my mind at dealer cost and they [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1670.6s)]
*  were going to go sell it for 550. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1676.6s)]
*  Retail. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1678.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1678.96s)]
*  Man. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1679.96s)]
*  And we're talking about this happening. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1681.0s)]
*  Somebody spending 330,000 in a matter of 25 to 45 seconds. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1683.4399999999998s)]
*  And so if that bid and starts out at 10,000 or something, like how quick, like, how do [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1689.28s)]
*  you know when to differentiate between a bid you're seeing on the floor and a bid [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1694.12s)]
*  that's that you are getting sent up to you from the ring? [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1698.08s)]
*  It, I mean, you're, you're both seeing the same thing. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1702.32s)]
*  So you're both on the same wavelength. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1705.6799999999998s)]
*  And if the bid, let's say the bid starts at 10 grand and there's eight people down [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1707.84s)]
*  there, just, just bidding, bidding, bidding, you'll go from 10, one, two, two and a [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1711.52s)]
*  half, five, you'll jump it up to two and a half, five, seven, a half, 11, 11, two and [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1716.0s)]
*  a half, five, seven and a half, 12. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1720.28s)]
*  I mean, you know, you, you, you read, you read the crowd like that. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1722.32s)]
*  Just like, just like you do. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1725.48s)]
*  It gets exciting. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1726.8799999999999s)]
*  It's very exciting. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1727.88s)]
*  It's fast paced too. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1728.8400000000001s)]
*  I think people like just hearing people count. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1730.4s)]
*  Remember they had that, you know, especially where I'm from, dude, if somebody could count [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1732.16s)]
*  high, you thought they were doing damn magic. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1736.48s)]
*  You know, I mean, half my neighborhood couldn't count. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1738.3200000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1741.68s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1741.92s)]
*  We had people, you told them about 11, they'd fucking know what you're talking about. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1742.48s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1746.0s)]
*  Like after 10, they thought it had something to do with Satan. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1747.24s)]
*  You know, it was real, just kind of novice numerical types, you know? [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1749.3600000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1753.76s)]
*  Um, what is, uh, take me through some of that bit and like, give me, show me a little [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1754.24s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1761.96s)]
*  Like if we're bidding on something, you know, um, how do you know, like, well, what are [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1762.16s)]

*  And like they're touched their face, wink, wink, and then like some people will turn [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1768.0s)]
*  away from you and like tap their leg or tap their foot and then wink at you. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1771.64s)]

*  And then you'll know, you'll know. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1801.08s)]
*  And sometimes the audience won't know that like who's doing it. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1802.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1804.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1804.6s)]
*  And guys over there in the corner just, oh, they, they play with each other so much. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1805.24s)]
*  And it's more so the, the, the, the experienced and the skilled dealers versus [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1809.28s)]
*  the younger newcomers that, that, that don't know, because there's, there's, [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1815.68s)]
*  there's always a new dealer that comes into the auction and doesn't have a [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1820.1599999999999s)]
*  clue as to what's going on. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1823.32s)]
*  Wow. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1824.72s)]
*  He's just standing out front like this. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1825.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1826.56s)]
*  And you know, the first two or three months are an education or an exit. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1827.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1831.84s)]
*  Oh, cause he's, he could be spending too much. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1832.04s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1833.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1834.28s)]
*  I mean, he can't get them sold. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1834.6399999999999s)]
*  If, if he doesn't get it figured out, I mean, he's going to exit the [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1835.76s)]
*  business because he owes a bunch of money. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1838.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1840.44s)]
*  And how much of it, I know in Texas, so many things are kind of like, uh, is it, [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1841.3600000000001s)]
*  is there any demographic to the business, to that whole bidding world? [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1845.48s)]
*  Is it predominantly white? [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1848.8400000000001s)]
*  Is it mixed? [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1850.0800000000002s)]
*  Is it Latino? [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1850.8400000000001s)]
*  We have a lot of middle East. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1852.0s)]
*  It's very mixed. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1853.2800000000002s)]
*  Middle Eastern too. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1853.92s)]
*  There's a lot of Middle Eastern. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1854.72s)]
*  And it also depends on the city you're working in too. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1856.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1858.68s)]
*  Like in the Valley, obviously, uh, lots of Latino people. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1859.1200000000001s)]
*  Um, we work in San Antonio twice a week, Tuesday and Wednesday. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1862.92s)]
*  And then, uh, when I get done there, uh, I drive to McAllen, Texas, and spend [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1867.24s)]
*  the night and work a auction there on Thursday morning and it's, it's. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1872.36s)]
*  Mostly Hispanic. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1877.96s)]
*  I mean, there's, there's, there's right there on the border. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1879.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1880.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1881.32s)]
*  But it's, it's really close to the border. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1881.72s)]
*  Does it fee, is it part of what kind of culture do you feel like? [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1883.96s)]
*  Is it part of Southern culture? [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1888.12s)]
*  Is it part of auto culture? [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1889.8799999999999s)]
*  Is it part of livestock culture? [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1891.96s)]
*  Like where does kind of auctioneering, where does some [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1893.84s)]
*  of that roots come from? [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1896.64s)]
*  I know you talked about the kernels, you know, in the military and that's sort [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1897.5200000000002s)]
*  of where that, the name of that position kind of came from, but can you tell me [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1901.16s)]
*  any more about how that, the, the, the fast talking and then separately, like, [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1905.64s)]
*  do you know, can you feel it all where that tradition kind of came out of? [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1911.0400000000002s)]
*  You know, I mean, I know over there, like in across the pond in England, [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1914.6000000000001s)]
*  they, they do it slow. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1918.2s)]
*  Oh, they do it really slow, like art auctions and stuff. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1919.44s)]
*  It's a slow process. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1922.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1923.16s)]
*  You'll fall asleep. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1923.2800000000002s)]
*  Um, but I think the Latin root for auction is action. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1924.48s)]
*  So it's like all about action. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1929.2s)]
*  So it's just a way to sell a lot of items really quickly and in competitive [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1931.08s)]
*  bidding matter, so like it's really a good way to get a train ride evaluation [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1936.8s)]
*  pretty much of what that product's worth. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1942.16s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1945.2s)]
*  Cause you got a bunch of people there and they're bidding on it. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1945.88s)]
*  So you're, you'll get an appraisal for that. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1947.8s)]
*  In my mind, it's a Southern culture, but you know, there's, there's [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1949.96s)]
*  auctions all over the world and all over the United States, New York, [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1953.36s)]
*  everywhere, you know, I guess because I was raised Southern, right. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1957.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1961.84s)]
*  For me, it's, it's Southern culture. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1962.56s)]
*  It's a Southern thing. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1964.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1965.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1965.7199999999998s)]
*  It's interesting. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1965.9199999999998s)]
*  Cause I started thinking about it. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1966.3999999999999s)]
*  Like I, I, I think, feel like there's some, there's like a Mark, a book [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1967.76s)]
*  with Mark Twain where they talk that there's an auction or something. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1971.56s)]
*  One of those stories. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1973.9199999999998s)]
*  I'm just trying to think of where I first kind of learned about [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1975.3999999999999s)]
*  auction and I heard about it. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1977.52s)]
*  Um, and I can't really remember. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1979.28s)]
*  So then I'm trying to think, well, what, yeah, is there a culture [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1982.2s)]
*  that it fits in with and then, yeah, it's a business. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1985.16s)]
*  It's a way of getting people to do business. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1987.96s)]
*  It is interesting to know that you could immediately kind of [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1989.8400000000001s)]
*  get an idea of a product. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1991.88s)]
*  Come sit, come with me. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1993.4s)]
*  Anything. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1994.1200000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1994.72s)]
*  If you got the right crowd there too, can you start to know a little bit? [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1995.16s)]
*  Could you guess almost like guessing somebody's weighted affair? [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=1999.0s)]
*  Like that guy gets used to knowing the scale and knowing that the people can [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2001.68s)]
*  almost definitely, oh yeah, like guess what it's something to bid for. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2005.04s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2008.52s)]
*  Because we know what they did the week prior. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2008.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2011.0s)]
*  And we pretty much know the car market. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2011.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2013.8s)]
*  We know what things are worth. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2014.0s)]
*  You know, that being said, you know, paying attention to what's going on [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2014.8799999999999s)]
*  and knowing the car market and remembering what that car brought the week prior, [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2020.24s)]
*  knowing who bought it the week prior. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2025.2s)]
*  Uh, it, it, it sets a stage. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2027.72s)]
*  You see what I'm saying? [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2029.8s)]
*  And so, so we kind of, we can, we can tell you, you know, what you're driving out there. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2030.56s)]
*  We don't have no idea what it is, but if we went out there and walked around it, we [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2034.8s)]
*  could give you a really good idea of what it was worth. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2037.9199999999998s)]
*  Okay. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2041.3999999999999s)]
*  Long as there's nothing crazy exotic. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2043.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2044.96s)]
*  Yeah, it is not, man. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2045.28s)]
*  It's a 2019 Ford Ranger. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2046.2s)]
*  Perfect. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2047.76s)]
*  So, um, here's a fella right here that had a inquiry. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2048.12s)]
*  What's up Theo. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2053.2799999999997s)]
*  It's your boy, Stain here in Louisville, Kentucky, a beautiful little evening. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2054.4s)]
*  Um, I'm calling in to ask a question to your auctioneer buddy, Mr. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2059.4s)]
*  Auctioneer, I want to know if you think you have what it takes to make it in [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2064.12s)]
*  the freestyle rap game. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2068.04s)]
*  I know a lot of times auctioneers, they can think real fast, talk real fast. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2070.04s)]
*  I think it makes a lot of sense that you could potentially be freestyling [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2074.8799999999997s)]
*  over some instrumental. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2078.44s)]
*  If so, do you think you have what it takes in that game? [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2080.2s)]
*  Gang gang. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2084.8799999999997s)]
*  Gang, baby. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2085.52s)]
*  That's a good question. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2086.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2087.2s)]
*  I love old school rap. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2087.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2089.2799999999997s)]
*  And I practice in the mirror and absolutely no. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2090.12s)]
*  No, me neither. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2093.24s)]
*  No. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2094.16s)]
*  I can count fast. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2094.3599999999997s)]
*  That's it. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2095.7599999999998s)]
*  I give, if the song was about numbers. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2096.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2098.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2099.24s)]

*  I looked just like spanky the little rascal. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2904.24s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2906.3599999999997s)]
*  I love the, I love the rascals. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2907.12s)]
*  That's how I got that nickname. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2909.3999999999996s)]
*  It's stuck. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2910.72s)]
*  Dude, I'll tell you this story. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2911.3599999999997s)]
*  So I was a huge fan growing up of Nickelodeon Nick at night, those type of [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2912.52s)]
*  television, black and white television. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2916.6s)]
*  And, uh, and so I was a huge fan of Jerry Mathers, leave it to be, [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2919.4799999999996s)]
*  or was the man, right? [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2925.12s)]
*  So one time I got to play in this poker card tournament in Oklahoma and it was [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2926.7999999999997s)]
*  like in rural Oklahoma at a casino. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2932.36s)]
*  And so I get there and Jerry Mathers there. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2934.0s)]
*  And I mean, I had pictures of them on my wall growing up and, and he was way [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2937.16s)]
*  before my time, but I just, for some reason I like his name was Theodore in [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2941.12s)]
*  the show, Theodore Cleaver, and that was my name. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2944.0s)]
*  So there he is right there. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2945.84s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2947.68s)]
*  And I said, Hey, you know, and I was so fired up, man. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2948.44s)]
*  And I mean, it looks just like the kids still. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2951.7999999999997s)]
*  It's pretty crazy. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2954.52s)]
*  And I said, Hey, uh, I live at, he's, I said, I said, Hey, you know, I'm a big fan. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2956.12s)]
*  And, you know, I was like, where he's like a living California. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2962.3199999999997s)]
*  I was like, Oh, I used to live in Santa Monica. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2965.2s)]
*  And this is a little bit vulgar, but he goes, I used to go get some [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2967.12s)]
*  pussy in Santa Monica. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2969.64s)]
*  And I was like, what? [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2971.92s)]
*  Like of all the things I've seen this man only as a kid. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2973.44s)]
*  And then he just hit the perfect role model. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2976.92s)]
*  He was the, he was the perfect kid. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2980.04s)]
*  He was the perfect one. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2982.12s)]
*  And then he hit me with that. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2983.44s)]
*  And I was like, Oh man, just ruined it. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2984.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2987.7599999999998s)]
*  It's just crazy when you always want your heroes to kind of be a certain way. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2988.0s)]
*  And then they're just mortals, you know, or immortals. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2991.0s)]
*  I don't know which one is what, but, um, but I looked just like Spanky [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2993.48s)]
*  as a kid growing up and I could see that a little bit to be honest. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=2998.12s)]
*  Where I got that nickname. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3000.2799999999997s)]
*  I could see, I could see it, but you look pretty young though. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3001.4s)]
*  You feel young. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3004.24s)]
*  I feel great. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3005.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3005.96s)]
*  And, uh, did you know that, uh, that cam was going to be your son who was going [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3006.68s)]
*  to be able to have that ability? [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3010.6s)]
*  Was there another, any other children you had that, that you saw that could be, [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3011.76s)]
*  uh, that have that possession? [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3015.0400000000004s)]
*  Uh, I have another 18 year old that has no interest in it at all. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3017.0400000000004s)]
*  That he's, he's more of a hands-on guy. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3021.5200000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3023.7200000000003s)]
*  Uh, he, he would rather tear something apart and build it back up. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3024.2000000000003s)]
*  Uh, but Cameron took a lot of interest in it at, at a very young age, you know, [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3028.0800000000004s)]
*  14, 15, and that was a lot, you know, back then, you know, the, the, the scare [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3032.5600000000004s)]
*  of the internet taking over wasn't there at all. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3038.2s)]
*  So he, he had a lot of interest in it and I knew that I could, could help him, [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3042.3199999999997s)]
*  you know, and he would have a good career in it. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3046.7599999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3048.8799999999997s)]
*  And, uh, uh, so the day he, the day he graduated high, he graduated high school [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3049.2s)]
*  on a Saturday and on the next Tuesday, he was on a flight to Missouri, going to [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3054.3999999999996s)]
*  Missouri auction school. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3058.2799999999997s)]
*  Wow. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3059.3599999999997s)]
*  Were you really? [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3059.64s)]
*  So no doubt. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3060.7599999999998s)]
*  No doubt. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3061.8399999999997s)]
*  And you knew even young, you knew when you were young, huh? [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3062.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I'd say I really got interested. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3065.12s)]
*  You know, I was working, uh, at my grandpa, grandpa's, uh, auto auction, [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3067.04s)]
*  picking up trash and do whatever they wanted me to do. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3072.0s)]
*  Jumping cars, you know, jumpstart the battery, parking cars, whatever. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3074.08s)]
*  And then, uh, I think like probably 14 years old, he sat me down. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3078.16s)]
*  He said, Hey, uh, you want to start working the ring? [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3081.48s)]
*  And so he kind of trained me up on it and threw me in the ring. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3084.72s)]
*  And we started working, um, you know, every Tuesday and Thursday, uh, in high [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3088.32s)]
*  school, I would actually leave class early. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3092.92s)]
*  I'd leave at noon on Tuesdays and go to the auction. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3095.56s)]
*  I had, uh, I had a couple teachers that would let me do it. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3098.16s)]
*  Oh, nice. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3102.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3102.52s)]
*  So, I mean, at a young age, for sure. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3102.7999999999997s)]
*  I took an interest to it. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3105.52s)]
*  Very interested. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3107.04s)]
*  What is the course to, how do you graduate the auction school? [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3108.08s)]
*  Um, there's really no test, but after you see you go to school and then you, [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3111.68s)]
*  you get a certification essentially, and then you have to take a state test [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3115.44s)]
*  to be licensed through the state. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3119.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3121.44s)]
*  Every state is different. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3121.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3122.68s)]
*  And then I was at a morning, you show up and you got to be able to really rattle. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3123.16s)]
*  No, it's actually a written test. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3126.64s)]
*  It's a written test. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3127.84s)]
*  Oh damn. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3128.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3128.76s)]
*  So your certifications for school basically lets you have the ability to take the [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3128.96s)]
*  test pretty much. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3135.08s)]
*  Until 10 years ago, you didn't even have to go to school, but now most states [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3136.16s)]
*  have required that you have 80 hours of schooling before you're eligible for the test. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3140.2400000000002s)]
*  Okay. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3145.36s)]

*  auction and like where people are like putting products up there, like any kind [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3151.8s)]
*  of dirty business that kind of comes through that you're able to see that you [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3155.84s)]
*  keep an eye on or anything that's happened over the years, not that you guys are pushing. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3158.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3162.36s)]
*  There's bad apples in every business. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3162.6800000000003s)]
*  I've seen a lot of stuff. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3164.6400000000003s)]

*  make it look like the air was cold. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3172.1200000000003s)]
*  Put a radio, a picture of a radio where the hole is and sell it so that, you know, [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3174.32s)]

*  And, uh, so the cops show up and I go back to the apartment and I say, man, [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3297.2799999999997s)]
*  I'm just going to get in the pool and hang out here until they leave. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3301.2s)]
*  And, uh, so I hung out in the pool and this is in January. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3304.4s)]
*  And that's a weird choice. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3309.24s)]
*  When the cops come out and see the pool and somebody's at it. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3310.24s)]
*  No, they, they, they've, they never even came to the pool because they didn't [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3312.2s)]
*  even think to look in the pool in January. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3315.16s)]
*  So I go walking back to my apartment thinking I'm in the clear and there I [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3316.6s)]
*  go and, and, and they're like, Hey, get on the ground. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3320.12s)]
*  And I'm like, what man? [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3322.7599999999998s)]
*  I've been at the pool. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3324.08s)]
*  And they're like, it's January. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3325.48s)]
*  Idiot. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3327.12s)]
*  Get on the ground. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3327.72s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3330.56s)]
*  I'm trying to think of, I had some good, good ones with cops, man. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3331.04s)]
*  I had a friend whose car, something had happened to it, speaking to autos. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3333.6s)]
*  And there was some kind of deficiency or something under the hood. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3337.48s)]
*  And when they rebuilt it, they built the seats backwards, right? [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3340.6s)]
*  So the seat, the backwards was the front of the car. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3345.04s)]
*  And so he'd get pulled over all the time, you know, cops is like, Oh, [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3348.8399999999997s)]
*  you're driving backwards. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3351.36s)]
*  And he's like, well, I'm not, you know, it's just the way this car, they put [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3352.24s)]
*  you know, they, whenever they redid it, they kind of did it messed up or whatever. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3355.8s)]
*  And he'd always get pulled over and bust a dude DUI or like, uh, they would [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3360.08s)]
*  breathalyze them all the time, you know, but the people just couldn't get it in [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3364.1600000000003s)]
*  their head that a man's driving a backwards car, not necessarily driving [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3367.36s)]
*  backwards, but it's pretty keen to see visually. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3371.1200000000003s)]
*  So what's something over the years that's kind of like, is there [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3374.36s)]
*  discrepancies down there in the, in the ring? [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3377.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, very much. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3379.96s)]
*  So I was bumping chest and talking trash. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3380.76s)]
*  I mean, there's getting upset with each other. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3383.68s)]
*  And I mean, I, I've seen one car dealer get mad at another one and the one, the, [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3385.4799999999996s)]

*  Um, okay, cool. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3942.88s)]
*  Let's get into a couple more of these questions, man. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3944.2s)]
*  People were really intrigued. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3946.16s)]
*  And so, you know, I was just driving through town about a month ago and I [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3947.2799999999997s)]
*  drove by, it said auction, auctioneer on the sign and I was like, Oh my God. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3950.3199999999997s)]
*  I was like, what is all, where, where, where are these people? [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3955.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3958.16s)]
*  Where are they? [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3958.36s)]
*  What are they doing? [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3959.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3960.6400000000003s)]
*  So this is real fascinating, man, just to hear about it. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3960.84s)]
*  Hey Theo, my question is for the father son auctioneer duo. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3965.6400000000003s)]
*  Uh, my question is, can you guys read really fast? [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3969.0s)]
*  I'm not a good reader. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3971.7200000000003s)]
*  I could barely read, but I'm not a great talker either. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3972.96s)]
*  So I figured if I could talk that fast, I could probably read fast. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3976.0800000000004s)]
*  Thanks guys. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3979.8s)]
*  Gang gang. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3980.48s)]
*  Hey, maybe that's a good question. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3981.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3982.28s)]
*  No, not at all. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3982.76s)]
*  I've gotten faster at reading, but, uh, um, no, I just learned how to read the [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3984.32s)]
*  less you take in for me. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3989.68s)]
*  Huh? [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3992.3599999999997s)]
*  I just learned. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3992.8799999999997s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3993.3199999999997s)]
*  I'm saying, yeah, I'm slow reader too. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3993.8799999999997s)]
*  Faster you read or the faster you try to get through it, the, the, the [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3995.68s)]
*  less you get out of it. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3998.52s)]
*  Right. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=3999.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4001.52s)]
*  That's kind of how I am. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4001.72s)]
*  I think that's all it's like, I got to read it a couple of times. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4002.56s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4005.24s)]
*  If you read it too fast, you got to go back, but no, I don't think that really [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4006.2799999999997s)]
*  equates if you lose your track, you're doing, you're running a bid, right? [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4009.6s)]
*  Is there every time you lose your track? [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4014.44s)]
*  It's just, so what do you do? [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4016.24s)]
*  Do you call it timeout? [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4017.72s)]
*  Screen, the screen, uh, there's a screen out there that usually helps if we, you [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4018.6s)]
*  know, forget where we're at, but nowadays, I mean, it's just like, like you said, [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4022.6s)]
*  it's like breathing. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4026.6s)]
*  It's like second nature to us. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4027.2799999999997s)]
*  You know, you can do it in your sleep pretty much, but you get to [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4029.36s)]
*  thinking about something else. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4031.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4032.68s)]
*  You know, while you're up there and think about what you're going to have for [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4032.8399999999997s)]
*  lunch, you know, there's not a lot of action going on on the floor, you know, [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4035.16s)]
*  and you, you get to thinking about something and you're at 28,000 next thing [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4038.0s)]
*  you say is 18,000. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4042.04s)]
*  Whoa, whoa, whoa. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4043.24s)]
*  I mean, 28,000. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4043.7999999999997s)]
*  You just jump right back. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4045.56s)]
*  There's a screen though that they follow us. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4046.52s)]
*  And so like the last thing we said is usually on the screen. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4049.44s)]
*  So you got some support. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4051.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4052.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4052.7599999999998s)]
*  Just in case, but it happens for sure. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4053.12s)]
*  Has any auctioneers ever been killed or anything like that in the line of duty? [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4055.28s)]
*  Hmm. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4059.48s)]
*  Not that I know of, not in the line of duty. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4060.16s)]
*  Nope. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4062.64s)]
*  Oh, that's good. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4064.36s)]
*  That is good. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4066.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4067.24s)]
*  Let's get to another question from a guy. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4067.4s)]
*  Probably some car dealers that want to kill some auctioneers. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4068.88s)]
*  Oh, really? [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4071.2s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4071.68s)]
*  Is there some inside work going on? [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4072.8s)]
*  Is there like kind of like they'll try and bait you or take you out to dinner or [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4074.36s)]
*  something? [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4077.1600000000003s)]
*  No, we, I mean, we just mess with them so much. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4077.4s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4080.4s)]
*  We see them every week. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4081.0s)]
*  We see them every week and we know their kids' names and we're all buddies, [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4081.6800000000003s)]

*  And they'll do both, you know, most there's livestock auctions all throughout the week. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4155.12s)]
*  But for example, a friend of mine that owns one in Gonzales, Texas, uh, uh, his is on [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4159.88s)]
*  Saturday and he works three or four sales during the week, car sales during the week. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4166.68s)]

*  No, we're both going at the same time. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4648.04s)]
*  Oh, really? [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4649.599999999999s)]

*  So it's all loud, but once you step into a lane, you can hear primarily that [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4651.759999999999s)]
*  auction and then behind me, there's two more other lanes going as well. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4655.12s)]
*  Wow. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4659.799999999999s)]
*  So there's a sound wall between you and that guy. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4661.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4663.0s)]

*  above that is a, is a great big wall that separates the two lanes. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4668.2s)]
*  That's where the speakers are too. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4672.639999999999s)]
*  They're way up. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4673.759999999999s)]
*  Speakers are up there. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4674.24s)]
*  And the rafters that actually at that auction, that what that caution sign is [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4675.2s)]

*  a little bit more about the world. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4692.12s)]
*  I understand that some of it's kind of a family, not a family business, but it [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4694.24s)]
*  or a lot of other people that are in the business, they have a family member in it. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4697.599999999999s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4702.879999999999s)]
*  Especially in the auto and the auto side primarily. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4703.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4705.759999999999s)]
*  I would say so. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4706.2s)]
*  Um, yeah, all the, all my auction buddies, like the video, he just showed him, uh, [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4707.4s)]

*  Uh, and then you got their dad, there's in it. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4714.12s)]
*  I mean, it's, it's a, and then that, that guy that was working the ring for me, that [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4716.799999999999s)]
*  he said, Jake Long, his dad is a, is a, uh, state world champion auctioneer. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4720.36s)]
*  Really? [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4726.879999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4727.599999999999s)]
*  Now, did any of you guys ever get into the competitions or what's that like? [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4728.28s)]
*  Not too much, man. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4731.28s)]
*  Um, I did one time when we were in Waco. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4732.44s)]
*  Uh, I never, I have never, ever, ever had any desire to do any competitions. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4735.8s)]
*  And what is it like the competition? [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4740.84s)]
*  Take me through some of it. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4742.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4743.48s)]
*  It's not, it's in my personal opinion, it's not based or judged off what we do on a daily [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4744.0s)]
*  basis because you only get three cars. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4750.719999999999s)]
*  Uh, you only get, you only get to sell three cars. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4754.92s)]
*  And I mean, it, it, it, I mean, you could get the wrong three cars. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4757.5199999999995s)]
*  You could get the right three cars. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4761.6s)]
*  You could, you could, you could not be, you know, it takes more than three cars to warm up. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4763.04s)]
*  Right. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4767.76s)]
*  So it's too subjective or objective. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4768.04s)]
*  I don't know which one, but it's the one that's not good. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4769.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4772.120000000001s)]
*  That one. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4772.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4774.120000000001s)]
*  It's just never been for me. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4774.92s)]
*  Totally. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4776.360000000001s)]
*  And just, so what is it like? [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4777.200000000001s)]
*  Not even that you really, I mean, obviously you just kind of checked it out to see what [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4778.360000000001s)]
*  it was like, but what is that comp it? [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4781.400000000001s)]
*  Like, what is it like if I'm at that thing, what is it? [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4782.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4785.200000000001s)]
*  So they have a auctioneer competition, uh, this is for automobiles, but they have other [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4785.400000000001s)]
*  ones who they have state and this one would be the world. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4789.160000000001s)]
*  Um, automobiles, automobile auctioneer. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4791.68s)]
*  And so they have that and they have a ring man competition. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4795.92s)]
*  I was 18. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4798.6s)]
*  I competed in the ring man. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4799.52s)]
*  Uh, I think I got like 11th place. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4801.240000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4803.240000000001s)]
*  And so the ring man is competing with letting the auctioneer know. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4803.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4806.52s)]
*  You, yeah. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4806.76s)]
*  It, it, it, with the other ring men. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4807.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4809.160000000001s)]
*  With the other ring men. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4809.360000000001s)]
*  And then there's an auctioneer competition. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4810.08s)]
*  I think it was supposed to be in Texas. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4811.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4813.360000000001s)]
*  There's a team deal too. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4813.4800000000005s)]
*  They're supposed to be in Texas and COVID, uh, came last year and I was actually going [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4814.240000000001s)]
*  to compete in it because it was coming to Texas. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4818.280000000001s)]
*  I think if it comes back to Texas, I'll probably compete. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4820.679999999999s)]
*  But other than that, I don't know. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4823.12s)]
*  Is it fun though? [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4825.16s)]
*  Uh, yeah, it can be. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4826.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4827.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4827.5599999999995s)]
*  It's a rush for sure. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4827.72s)]
*  Right. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4828.96s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4830.28s)]
*  I mean, look, a lot of those, a lot of comp, when you get into a competition, [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4830.92s)]
*  it's the same as stand up comedy. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4834.08s)]
*  It's just different. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4835.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4835.96s)]
*  I have friends that were on last comic standing that are better comedians [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4836.16s)]
*  than the friends that have won it. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4839.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4840.12s)]
*  Same deal. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4840.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4841.0s)]
*  Same. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4841.32s)]
*  Same as what it is. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4841.639999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4842.679999999999s)]
*  It's hard to get, get into a competition about something like that. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4842.92s)]
*  Right. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4845.679999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4846.12s)]
*  Damn. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4846.44s)]
*  I wonder, has there ever been a movie about auctioneers? [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4846.76s)]
*  There needs to be. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4849.92s)]
*  I think it'd be great. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4850.68s)]
*  There used to be a show or something. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4852.360000000001s)]
*  Who was the fellow that had trouble with the drinking? [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4853.68s)]
*  What was his name? [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4856.240000000001s)]
*  Uh, let's call him John. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4857.84s)]
*  Okay. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4859.280000000001s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4860.4400000000005s)]
*  I didn't mean to call him out. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4860.64s)]
*  I'm just thinking if it's a neat name, you make me think about the movie character. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4861.240000000001s)]
*  No, but he would be a great movie. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4864.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAV5s4HpkE&t=4867.360000000001s)]
