# Chris D'Elia 2  This Past Weekend w Theo Von #204
**Theo Von - This Past Weekend:** [June 06, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w)
*  Welcome to some sheer joy. Today's episode is brought to you by Grey Block Pizza. Grey Block Pizza 1811 Pico Boulevard in Los Angeles. Grey Block, get that hitter. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=0.0s)]
*  Some people say he's an arch rival, a nemesis or a nemesis, they say. Some people say that he is a myth. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=14.08s)]
*  But do myths show up in the form of man? I don't know. I don't even know what I'm talking about. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=23.52s)]
*  But I'll say this for 150%. That we have a young man in today, fresh off this documentary about his shoulders popping off. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=34.56s)]
*  We have a cult leader. We have a film, television, Instagram, Vine star, Phenom. This guy is the Will Smith of Vine. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=46.6s)]
*  This guy is a haberdasher with his new baby's line. This guy is the new Warren Jeffs to a lot of people. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=62.64s)]
*  He's a comedian. He's a podcaster. I'm getting tired of introducing him. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=76.64s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, from the Congratulations Pod, which I recommend you listen to if you want to get really dented, Mr. Chris D'Alea. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=82.64s)]
*  Are you bigger there than you are in America? I think I might be an Australian comedian. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=112.68s)]
*  Are you, what's his name? Arge Barker? Arge Barker sounds also like someone vomited, I feel like. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=118.68s)]
*  The name? Just saying Arge Barker. One time I was in Montreal and I was coming up and I felt like all people were starting to know my name. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=130.68s)]
*  Arge Barker came down to the lobby and he was like, are you my driver? No. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=136.72s)]
*  And I was like, ah, okay. Okay. I'm on new faces. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=140.72s)]
*  This was after that. I had like a fucking, I was like, nah, I'm a comedian. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=144.72s)]
*  And I laughed and he was like, oh shit, okay. And then the next two years later I saw Arge Barker. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=152.72s)]
*  He was at Starbucks and he saw me and was like, hey, hey Chris. And I was like, ah, redemption. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=159.72s)]
*  Got to drive. Yeah. Sorry, I'm parallel parked out front. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=163.76s)]
*  Dude, you look big. You look old or you look different. I feel like. Are you doing anything different? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=167.76s)]
*  So, what are you doing? What are you doing to take care of yourself? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=173.76s)]
*  Well, I work out a lot. You do? Yeah. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=180.76s)]
*  Because like I get bored on the road, but then also I just was like, I want to do action movies. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=182.76s)]
*  Yeah. Like, so like, I'm like, if I'm going to do that, I have to actually do actual work. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=191.79999999999998s)]
*  You have to look the part. Yeah. So, so I started working out really fucking hard. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=197.79999999999998s)]
*  Are you doing unique types of training? Because you seem like somebody that doesn't do, I see you in some of your videos. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=201.79999999999998s)]
*  I see you, you know, I know that they had the shoulder documentary thing that people were, you know, that they're pitching and stuff. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=207.79999999999998s)]
*  And I know the shoulders are outside right now. No, the, the doc, the guy, the crew. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=213.79999999999998s)]
*  Oh, they are. I try to speed away, but they have fucking good drivers. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=217.79999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Oh, that's crazy, man. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=220.84s)]
*  Well, it's the trapper, too. They're trying to get pictures of people's tracks. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=222.84s)]
*  Right. And, but are you doing any like a unique training? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=225.84s)]
*  I see you doing like American Ninja Warrior stuff. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=229.84s)]
*  When I think of you and get jealous a little, some of the jealous thoughts I have of you swinging off of different stuff. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=231.84s)]
*  So the thoughts of me, the jealous thoughts of me are all about me being active. I like that a lot. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=236.84s)]
*  Yeah. Now they are since you told me you wanted to be an action hero. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=240.84s)]
*  Right. So, so you've had those jealous thoughts for about 35 seconds. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=244.84s)]
*  Yeah. No, I've had them for about six or seven years. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=248.88s)]
*  Okay. Yeah. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=250.88s)]
*  Yeah. I don't know, man. Like I get like this, first of all, like this, the movies that I am being considered for are like movies, TV are like all like comedy, silly. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=252.88s)]
*  You know, I'm either a young dad or I'm like, I've just done, they're, they're, they're only going to offer you stuff that you've kind of already done. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=264.88s)]
*  Right. Because they can see you doing that. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=273.88s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=275.88s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=276.88s)]
*  But I've never been in the industry. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=277.92s)]
*  Well, it's just safe, you know, and I don't blame them because they know, they know, you know, take, take an action movie star. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=278.92s)]
*  They're going to get offered action movie stuff. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=286.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=288.92s)]
*  They're not going to. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=289.92s)]
*  They're not going to, you know, it might be a little bit out of the box, be like, well, can you do a romantic comedy? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=290.92s)]
*  I don't know. Let's see him do. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=294.92s)]
*  Let's see him act. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=295.92s)]
*  Let's see him audition or whatever. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=296.92s)]
*  Like, will people believe it? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=297.92s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=298.92s)]
*  But for so for me, like, but I don't want to do this. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=299.92s)]
*  Like if I'm going to do a comedy, the best comedy for us that we're going to do is our stand-up. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=301.92s)]
*  Because it's exactly what we're gonna do. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=306.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=308.58000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, it is interesting. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=309.42s)]
*  You start thinking sometimes, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=310.26s)]
*  oh, I gotta fit in in this role as a sketch or in a series. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=311.08000000000004s)]
*  Like, oh, I'm already doing my whole series. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=316.6s)]
*  I know. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=318.68s)]
*  In a show. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=319.52000000000004s)]
*  And you're also, if you're gonna do a movie or a TV show, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=320.34000000000003s)]
*  you're gonna take a pay cut [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=323.32s)]
*  because you make more money doing standup. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=324.64s)]
*  So if I'm gonna take a pay cut, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=326.32s)]
*  I wanna do some shit I wanna do. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=328.64s)]
*  And to me, it would be awesome to do action [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=329.76s)]
*  or something hilarious like that. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=331.6s)]
*  I could see you doing it in like a Deadpool, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=333.08000000000004s)]
*  but sort of like in maybe like right outside of, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=335.2s)]
*  I don't wanna say Oklahoma City, but maybe like Missouri. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=338.88s)]
*  I could do a Deadpool. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=341.32s)]
*  Kansas City. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=343.44s)]
*  Kansas City. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=344.28s)]
*  Like how they do the CSI in all the different areas, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=345.35999999999996s)]
*  but they do one for, they do the Deadpool, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=348.28s)]
*  Deadpool, Kansas City. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=350.36s)]
*  Yeah, I think, I mean, I don't know. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=351.74s)]
*  I could see you also being a really unique villain [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=353.2s)]
*  in like a dark city, like a Gotham. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=356.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=358.84s)]
*  I definitely have the eyebrows for that. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=359.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=361.59999999999997s)]
*  But also I'm going, I think what you're saying, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=362.44s)]
*  I look different because I got a little gray [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=364.28s)]
*  in the last year. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=366.15999999999997s)]
*  Oh, is that what it is? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=367.11999999999995s)]
*  I think so. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=367.96s)]
*  You do seem older or more confident maybe to me. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=368.78s)]
*  You've always seemed confident though, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=372.15999999999997s)]
*  so you couldn't seem more confident than you have. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=373.2s)]
*  Did you ever grow this out? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=374.88s)]
*  No. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=376.71999999999997s)]
*  Because you probably have some gray, huh? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=377.55999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I get gray. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=378.38s)]
*  It's very scary. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=379.88s)]
*  I have gray chest hair too. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=380.71999999999997s)]
*  Oh wow. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=381.76s)]
*  And somebody saw it the other day on a video [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=382.59999999999997s)]
*  and it was like 70 people said something. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=383.91999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=386.0s)]
*  First it hurt my feelings, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=387.44s)]
*  then it reminded me of my grandfather. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=388.28s)]
*  Well, and that's kind of not bittersweet, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=390.0s)]
*  but also to have 70 people talking about [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=391.96s)]
*  your fucking gray chest hair, that means you made it. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=395.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=398.03999999999996s)]

*  You're not the guy in the back. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1111.3600000000001s)]
*  By the way, army, that's opposite of a classroom. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1112.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's opposite. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1115.24s)]
*  Yeah, you're dumb as fuck, you're in the front. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1116.0800000000002s)]
*  They're all the lapped motherfuckers. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1117.64s)]
*  You're catching bullets. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1119.1200000000001s)]
*  So yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1119.96s)]
*  You're the guy. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1120.8s)]
*  They teach you how to catch bullets with your heart. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1121.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1122.88s)]
*  Or a head. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1124.48s)]
*  Head or heart. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1125.52s)]
*  Johnny caught it in the shoulder. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1127.4s)]
*  Not good enough. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1128.64s)]
*  Not good enough. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1129.64s)]
*  So. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1131.68s)]
*  Okay, so that's two of the classes then. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1132.52s)]
*  They're gone. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1134.08s)]
*  English is out. English is out, right? [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1134.92s)]
*  Social studies, by the way. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1136.6s)]
*  That's what we learned about the neighborhood. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1138.1399999999999s)]
*  What is it? Yeah. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1139.2s)]
*  But it's not though, do you understand? [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1140.16s)]
*  It's neighborhood, it's what statues are. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1141.8799999999999s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1143.96s)]
*  So this is what it should be. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1144.8s)]
*  Actually, for real, how a city or neighborhood works. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1146.3s)]
*  Okay. Okay. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1148.6399999999999s)]
*  That should be class, and we call that what? [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1149.68s)]
*  Just basically street beats. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1152.12s)]
*  All right, cool, I like that. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1154.0s)]
*  That's a good class name. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1158.34s)]
*  Also, if the class names were hip. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1159.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1161.68s)]
*  If the class names were hip like that, [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1162.52s)]
*  I would be in it, man. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1165.48s)]
*  Yes, sir, I'd take street beats, boy. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1166.6000000000001s)]
*  Street beats, AP street beats. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1168.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, AP street beats, dude. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1170.44s)]
*  Yeah, Larry got a tattoo. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1172.8400000000001s)]
*  Now why did Larry get a tattoo? [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1175.5600000000002s)]
*  Right, yeah. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1177.28s)]
*  So today we're learning class why Larry got a tattoo. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1178.28s)]
*  And I'm in the front, right? [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1181.0s)]
*  Is it because his name is Larry? [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1183.1200000000001s)]
*  All guys named Larry have a tattoo. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1185.24s)]
*  If you ever met a guy whose name Larry, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1186.48s)]
*  and doesn't have a tattoo, [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1188.0800000000002s)]
*  and he's not in the Three Stooges, [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1188.92s)]
*  you haven't met a Larry, I'll tell you that much. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1190.24s)]
*  So, so. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1192.04s)]
*  So you got street beats. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1193.1200000000001s)]
*  So street beats. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1196.68s)]
*  Swimming, huh? [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1198.32s)]
*  Hmm, depends, really. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1199.4s)]
*  Not in Indiana, no, but in LA, yes. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1201.76s)]
*  In the beach, yeah, beaching. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1205.84s)]
*  West coast, east coast. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1207.68s)]
*  Being a beach guy. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1209.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1210.6s)]
*  Beach guy. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1211.44s)]
*  Maybe like up near some fucking city west of Portland, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1212.28s)]
*  you might learn that. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1216.2s)]
*  Body style, or like, yeah, let me think. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1217.04s)]
*  You learn, you know what a good class would be? [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1220.72s)]
*  Like to learn who an alpha is. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1223.56s)]
*  Like you have to understand who the alphas are, [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1226.0s)]
*  and we call the class pecking order. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1227.96s)]
*  Okay, yeah, pecking order. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1230.24s)]
*  Like you don't. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1231.6s)]
*  PO they call it for sure. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1232.44s)]
*  Yeah, who do you have for PO? [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1233.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1234.96s)]
*  Yeah, and it would be like this real fucking, [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1235.8s)]
*  either you would have teachers that were like real alpha, [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1237.48s)]
*  or these real beta motherfuckers that were like, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1239.76s)]
*  look, I understand who I am, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1241.8s)]
*  and it's okay if this is who you are, [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1244.1200000000001s)]
*  but you need to know who you are. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1245.48s)]
*  And if an alpha walks in the room, [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1246.44s)]
*  you kind of look at them like, you know what I mean? [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1247.68s)]
*  Yeah, just water the plants again. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1250.32s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1251.1599999999999s)]
*  How do you look at, how you offer him a lollipop, [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1252.0s)]
*  or whatever the fuck it is. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1253.56s)]
*  Like who, you know, you understand, you know, not class. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1254.3999999999999s)]
*  Right, pecking order. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1257.1599999999999s)]
*  It would be like, Greg, stand up, [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1258.24s)]
*  show us how you look at an alpha. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1259.36s)]
*  And he'll be like, because I'm a beta, yes. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1260.56s)]
*  And then Greg goes like this, and you're like A plus. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1262.1599999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah, A plus, Greg. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1264.08s)]
*  Yeah, just keep hanging the Christmas ornaments, Greg. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1265.68s)]
*  He'll be over there under the mistletoe. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1267.9199999999998s)]
*  He'll be over there under the mistletoe. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1269.24s)]
*  100%. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1270.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1271.96s)]
*  I think how to behave at functions is another one maybe. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1272.8s)]
*  That's a good one. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1275.08s)]
*  Function behavior. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1275.9199999999998s)]
*  That could probably be in PO. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1276.76s)]
*  It could be in PO. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1278.76s)]
*  Yeah, it could be like a second year. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1279.68s)]
*  Yeah, because alphas behave differently than betas. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1281.64s)]
*  Oh, it's different. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1284.28s)]
*  Alphas will leave a place early. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1285.3600000000001s)]
*  Kind of to go do something better, [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1287.8s)]
*  even though they're not doing anything, [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1288.84s)]
*  and get there late. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1289.92s)]
*  Yeah, the alphas are only in places for like 25 minutes. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1290.76s)]
*  Yeah, sometimes they barely even show up, [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1292.84s)]
*  they get there late and they left early. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1294.04s)]
*  Yeah, would you say you're an alpha? [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1295.4s)]
*  Me? [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1296.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1297.7s)]
*  No, I think I'm more of a beta, probably. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1298.54s)]
*  I'm like one of those Chinese fighting fish, I think. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1300.72s)]
*  What are those betas? [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1302.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1305.16s)]
*  But I think they have their own alpha beta shit going on. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1306.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, yeah, they're suicidal, some of them. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1308.04s)]
*  But they only think they're killing themselves. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1310.88s)]
*  A lot of them think it's a mirror [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1312.92s)]
*  and they're killing themselves, that's why they do that. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1313.76s)]
*  That's so fucking interesting. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1315.72s)]
*  You know what? [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1316.72s)]
*  You came to a dinner once and you came late and left early. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1317.56s)]
*  Remember that dinner? [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1319.4s)]
*  Oh yeah, I did. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1320.22s)]
*  So you might have been alpha. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1321.06s)]
*  Yeah, because you guys, first of all, [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1321.9s)]
*  it was a dinner in the dark outside a restaurant. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1322.72s)]
*  But that's what a fucking, that's what a nice place is. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1324.76s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1327.84s)]
*  You don't go to a fucking bright place for dinner, dude. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1328.68s)]
*  What are you fucking, you know, you make some money, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1330.6s)]
*  you gotta go fucking dim the lights, bro. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1332.12s)]
*  Make money. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1333.8s)]
*  I wanna see what I mean, bro. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1334.64s)]
*  Because you're poor in your heart. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1336.96s)]
*  That's why. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1338.3600000000001s)]
*  You guys. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1339.2s)]
*  You're poor in your heart, you gotta let that go. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1340.04s)]
*  That's true, man. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=1343.8s)]

*  Well, let me ask you a question, [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2042.76s)]

*  but do you take your time doing it [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2045.24s)]
*  or do you just do it to get it done? [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2047.1200000000001s)]
*  I usually, I can get it done in less than a minute. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2049.88s)]
*  I don't ever take more than two minutes. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2051.6s)]

*  and you just fucking, you have a conversation with yourself. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2084.68s)]
*  Like not out loud, but in your head. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2087.96s)]

*  what I've been working on a lot lately is a lot like that [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2153.36s)]
*  is when I, when I'm staring at somebody [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2155.92s)]
*  and then they look at me, you know, [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2158.88s)]
*  the instinct is to look away, but that's a bitch move. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2161.48s)]
*  You gotta keep staring at them. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2165.12s)]
*  If they're, if you're staring at them and they catch you, [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2166.88s)]

*  I've been working on that. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2176.36s)]
*  It's very hard for some reason. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2177.2000000000003s)]
*  Isn't that weird? [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2178.52s)]
*  Yeah, it's very hard because it's extremely unnatural. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2179.4s)]
*  I know it's very unnatural, [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2183.28s)]
*  but I think that we can switch that. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2184.84s)]
*  I think that we can change that. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2187.48s)]
*  I think we can change that. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2188.6800000000003s)]

*  So I have to work on it for myself. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2193.4s)]
*  And this way, when they're growing up [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2195.44s)]

*  Yeah, I just want, I mean, I think about Bobby a lot, dude. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2555.88s)]
*  Cause I worry that he's just not living up [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2558.7s)]
*  to his full potential. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2560.82s)]
*  Right, so you think about that, which is very nice. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2561.7s)]
*  But also you might think, you know, [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2563.94s)]
*  what it's like inside of his girl. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2567.14s)]
*  No, no. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2569.02s)]
*  But you make up shit, don't you make up situations [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2570.06s)]
*  in your head? [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2572.46s)]
*  I do it all day long. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2573.3s)]
*  No, you do this. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2574.14s)]
*  All day long. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2574.96s)]
*  That's one thing I'm into, so I think I used to be able [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2575.8s)]
*  to do it more, and I don't know what happened to me [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2577.22s)]
*  as I got older, I got more worried about shit. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2578.78s)]
*  I mean, that's what my podcast is. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2580.54s)]
*  It's like, what if this happened and then that happened [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2581.82s)]
*  and then for some reason people listened to it. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2583.58s)]
*  Yeah, you're good at that, man. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2585.46s)]
*  You're good at being like, [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2586.5s)]
*  what, oh, what, what, what, what, what, what, no. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2588.26s)]
*  Yeah, and then like taking a sin [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2592.3s)]
*  to like an alternate universe, but it's good. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2593.9s)]
*  I think it's what makes you a good actor. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2595.3s)]
*  It's like you have an interest in taking people [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2596.6600000000003s)]
*  into an alternate universe. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2599.26s)]
*  You know, it's one of the things that maybe make you [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2600.9s)]
*  wanna be a fighter, like a superhero in that universe [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2602.7400000000002s)]
*  is because you wanna be in these alternate universes. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2608.46s)]
*  You wanna be able to shoot a laser [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2611.0800000000004s)]
*  out of your fucking neck bone, you know? [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2612.38s)]
*  Like you wanna be able to lift it up [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2614.0600000000004s)]
*  into a fucking galaxy ship, you know? [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2616.0600000000004s)]
*  I think these are things that seem realistic on you [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2618.86s)]
*  because you kind of live them out in your everyday. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2623.1s)]
*  Even some of your old images I remember on your website, [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2628.54s)]
*  you're on a fucking, you're shooting a fucking water gun [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2631.02s)]
*  on top of a fucking whale's back or something. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2633.5s)]
*  Like where is this motherfucker, dude? [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2636.18s)]
*  Is he must be by the airport or something. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2638.02s)]
*  You can't check yourself though, you know? [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2640.46s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2641.94s)]
*  And you're good at that, but you also do, [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2642.7799999999997s)]
*  you check yourself sometimes. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2644.62s)]
*  Yeah, I think I check myself often. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2645.86s)]
*  Yeah, but you also, what makes you so fucking funny [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2647.2599999999998s)]
*  is like you have your own language and shit. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2651.3399999999997s)]
*  We actually kind of both have that, [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2653.26s)]
*  like you know what I mean? [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2654.2200000000003s)]
*  Like I hear people doing your terms and shit, [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2655.0600000000004s)]
*  but like you have a style where like you're so you [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2656.38s)]
*  and that's because you let yourself be that way. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2664.1400000000003s)]
*  That's when you're best, I think. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2665.94s)]
*  I think that's what most people think about you, you know? [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2667.78s)]
*  And then like you go off [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2670.0600000000004s)]
*  and you worry about stuff after that. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2671.26s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I do, immediately make it on. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2673.02s)]
*  Yeah, you don't have to do that. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2674.7000000000003s)]
*  First I see if Neil Brennan has any advice for me [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2675.5400000000004s)]
*  and then I just go worry about myself. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2677.5s)]
*  And he does. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2679.1800000000003s)]
*  And he does, yeah. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2680.02s)]
*  He usually has a couple of fucking free insights. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2680.84s)]
*  What about this though, dude? [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2683.76s)]
*  Do you think that, do you find, [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2684.96s)]
*  I find sometimes I have trouble telling a story [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2689.1200000000003s)]
*  that I've told before after a while on the road [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2691.7200000000003s)]
*  and making it feel genuine to myself. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2694.56s)]
*  Interesting, well you're like a storyteller pretty much. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2696.92s)]
*  Right? [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2699.6800000000003s)]
*  Yes, I think so, yeah. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2700.52s)]
*  I mean, I like telling stories. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2701.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, no, I mean, you're fucking, you should. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2702.6800000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2705.36s)]
*  You kind of are though. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2706.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, kind of, yeah, kind of. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2707.28s)]
*  Yeah, sometimes it's weird. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2709.8s)]
*  Like I'll do a bit like five times and it'll crush [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2711.44s)]
*  and then it'll drop off after like five times [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2718.8s)]
*  and then I'll get it back for a while. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2722.0s)]
*  And then like after like seven months, [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2724.84s)]
*  I think that's what you're talking about. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2727.4s)]
*  Like I'll just be like, I'm just doing this. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2729.56s)]
*  I'm just saying this. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2731.64s)]
*  Yes, that's what it starts to be [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2732.48s)]
*  and I can't find my way out of that. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2733.48s)]
*  It's like every time, like okay, [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2735.2599999999998s)]
*  I'm gonna make it fresh this time, I'm gonna make it new [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2736.72s)]
*  and I'll try to, but it just doesn't. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2738.4s)]
*  But a newer bit always does better. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2740.64s)]
*  I know, I know, I know. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2743.32s)]
*  And it kind of sucks too because like a bit [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2745.2000000000003s)]
*  is so much better. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2748.12s)]
*  Like give or do, like the other day I did some shit [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2749.92s)]
*  that I've been doing, then I did a new bit and it worked [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2753.44s)]
*  and it was good. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2757.2400000000002s)]
*  It wasn't amazing, but it was good. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2759.0s)]
*  And then I went into my old shit, like that I, again, [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2760.6800000000003s)]
*  like from that I've been working on [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2765.0s)]
*  and it was just like, oh, that's how a bit works. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2766.96s)]
*  It was like boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2769.52s)]
*  And I was like, fuck, I gotta get that new bit to that. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2771.52s)]
*  But the new bit is the shit, the laughs that you're getting [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2773.84s)]
*  from the new bit is the shit that where they're like, [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2777.28s)]
*  they are laughing because they feel you excited about it. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2782.0s)]
*  Yeah, oh, maybe that's what it is [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2785.0s)]
*  and they can understand your excitement. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2786.32s)]
*  Yeah, so I always like think about like, [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2787.84s)]
*  like I laugh a lot on stage and people are like, [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2790.68s)]
*  are you laughing? [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2798.3599999999997s)]
*  Is that real? [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2800.1s)]
*  And the truth is I'm laughing not at what I'm saying. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2801.2s)]
*  I'm laughing at the fact that I can't believe [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2804.8799999999997s)]
*  I get to do this for a job and it's so fun. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2807.7999999999997s)]
*  And I'm like looking at you guys and like, [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2810.56s)]

*  Like I can't believe you let me do this as a job. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2819.6s)]
*  And these jokes that I thought of, [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2821.96s)]
*  a lot of them I thought of on stage, [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2824.2400000000002s)]
*  so I laughed when I was saying them. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2825.68s)]
*  So I just keep that vibe, you know? [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2827.6s)]
*  It's not like I'm laughing. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2829.64s)]
*  I know I've said this shit before, you know? [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2830.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2832.76s)]

*  Knowing that they're gonna about to enjoy it [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2838.6s)]
*  or that they are having a good time, it's like, it's fun. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2840.36s)]
*  Yeah, I feel like as an audience member, [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2844.32s)]
*  like you see the spark in the comedian [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2845.7000000000003s)]

*  they're so like in touch with this. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2852.04s)]
*  And then after a while, like obviously [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2854.0s)]
*  you're doing the same joke. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2855.6800000000003s)]
*  It's like, you're not as excited telling the story, [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2856.6s)]
*  so the crowd isn't excited hearing it. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2858.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2860.28s)]
*  I mean, it's definitely like an energy thing, right? [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2861.52s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, it must be. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2863.64s)]
*  It must be, yeah, that's why. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2865.08s)]
*  Sometimes it's not like, I wanna tell them the story [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2866.6s)]
*  because they've never heard it, but I just, [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2868.36s)]
*  it doesn't land as great as it once did. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2870.48s)]
*  But you know what though, sometimes it does [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2873.28s)]
*  and you just don't think it does, you know? [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2874.84s)]
*  Like you ever have those sets where you're like, [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2876.76s)]
*  oh, they didn't like me. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2878.0s)]
*  And then they come out, like if there's a meet and greet [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2879.16s)]
*  and they're like, dude, that's the funniest thing [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2881.52s)]
*  I've ever seen. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2882.56s)]
*  Yeah, like in Minnesota? [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2883.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2884.72s)]
*  You're like, you didn't seem like it. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2885.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2887.32s)]
*  You're like, all right. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2888.16s)]
*  Yeah, I guess that's true. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2889.0s)]
*  And I guess maybe if you hear a song enough, [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2889.82s)]
*  if you know the cadences of their laughter [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2892.24s)]
*  at certain points, you hear a, [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2894.08s)]
*  it's just like hearing a song enough where you're like, [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2895.32s)]
*  oh, the song is still good, but it's not the same [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2897.04s)]
*  as this new song that I'm playing. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2899.52s)]
*  Right, yeah. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2900.68s)]
*  When I tell these new jokes and I get different laughs on. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2901.52s)]
*  Like remember the first time you heard fucking, [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2903.68s)]
*  hot in, it's so hot in here. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2906.12s)]
*  You were like, oh, what? [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2908.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2909.72s)]
*  That fucking Nelly song? [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2910.56s)]
*  Yeah, so good. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2911.64s)]
*  But now you'd be like, okay. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2913.08s)]
*  Well, maybe now you'd be like, oh, I remember that. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2915.0s)]
*  But like after like, here's the thing, dude. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2916.72s)]
*  Songs, like four years later, [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2921.2s)]
*  you're like, get this shit off. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2923.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2925.0s)]
*  But songs like eight years later, [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2925.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2927.7599999999998s)]
*  You're like, oh, this shit rocked. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2928.6s)]
*  Yeah, we did that. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2929.7999999999997s)]
*  You gotta get back to that point in your act, you know? [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2930.64s)]
*  Or at least for me, that's what I think. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2933.92s)]
*  I'll do the song, I'll do the joke. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2935.48s)]
*  It's banging, because it's a hit. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2938.3599999999997s)]
*  It's a new song that just came out. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2939.64s)]
*  And then it drops off because it's like, [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2941.2799999999997s)]
*  you're in the three year thing where you're like, [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2943.72s)]
*  this is like an old song. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2945.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2946.64s)]
*  And then it's like when I was young, [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2947.48s)]
*  when I was 15 and 16, [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2950.2799999999997s)]
*  I started getting embarrassed hanging out with my dad, [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2952.08s)]
*  because that's like the age you get embarrassed [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2953.7999999999997s)]
*  hanging out with your parents. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2955.12s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2955.96s)]
*  And my dad said, we used to hang out, what the fuck? [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2956.7999999999997s)]
*  And I said to him, yeah, but it only lasts [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2959.56s)]
*  for like a few years. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2961.52s)]
*  When I'm 19 or 20, after high school again, [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2962.44s)]
*  it'll be cool to hang out with you again. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2964.52s)]
*  He was like, really? [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2965.84s)]
*  And I was like, yep, and it's true. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2966.68s)]
*  Wow. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2968.48s)]
*  It's that thing you gotta get back to being a 19 year old [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2969.32s)]
*  again where it's cool hanging out with your dad. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2971.88s)]
*  No, it makes sense. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2973.44s)]
*  But you knew that in advance and told you that? [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2974.28s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, my dad always brings it up. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2975.6s)]
*  He was like, dude, how did you know that in advance? [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2977.12s)]
*  And I was like, I don't know. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2978.72s)]
*  I think I just saw people doing it. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2979.56s)]
*  Do you know all of it, like all the beats of the life? [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2980.96s)]
*  And then it's just like you are- [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2983.24s)]
*  I think so. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2984.84s)]
*  So how are you enjoying it then if you already know it all, [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2985.92s)]
*  if you know how it's all gonna kind of break down [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2988.16s)]
*  and when to do what? [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2990.68s)]
*  Yeah, but it's like because the anticipation [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2991.96s)]
*  is what the most fun, which is the fun. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2995.6s)]
*  It's like when you're like, let's go to Vegas [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=2998.44s)]
*  and you're in Vegas, it's usually not as fun [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3000.88s)]

*  But I don't remember, I do remember being, [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3640.54s)]
*  I felt like intimidated to talk to you kind of. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3642.3s)]
*  I would get nervous talking to you [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3644.7400000000002s)]
*  because you were always so confident. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3645.98s)]
*  You always say that, yeah. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3647.58s)]
*  Yeah, and I was, I remember I'd be like, [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3648.78s)]
*  I don't know what I'm gonna fucking say. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3650.62s)]
*  Like, ugh. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3652.26s)]

*  Oh, this is like if me and you had a baby. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3656.22s)]
*  I have. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3657.7s)]
*  This guy. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3658.54s)]
*  Hey guys, this is Austin from Jackson, Mississippi. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3659.98s)]

*  Gang gang cult cult. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3666.42s)]
*  Anyways, ask Chris if he's gonna continue [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3669.46s)]
*  with the 30 minute standup specials [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3671.9s)]
*  or if he's gonna go back to the traditional hour. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3674.58s)]
*  Love to hear y'alls thoughts on that. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3677.2599999999998s)]
*  I like this guy already. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3679.98s)]
*  Peace player. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3680.82s)]
*  Nice guy out of Jackson, Mississippi [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3681.66s)]
*  and I used to get drunk over there. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3683.02s)]
*  Over there by Howlin' Mow's [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3685.98s)]
*  and over there by the Cherokee Bar. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3686.82s)]
*  I think once you cross the line, you're drunk. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3687.66s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3689.22s)]
*  You get there, you're like, it feels so weird. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3690.06s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3691.62s)]
*  And then you see the sign, [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3692.46s)]
*  welcome to Jackson, Mississippi. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3693.28s)]
*  Oh, my reading goes down the second I even get over there. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3694.12s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3696.2599999999998s)]
*  It's interesting. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3697.2599999999998s)]
*  So, yeah, so. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3699.22s)]
*  What would you do next? [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3701.58s)]
*  Would you do another Netflix? [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3702.42s)]
*  Would you put something out on your own? [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3703.5s)]
*  Would you do? [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3704.86s)]
*  So I'm doing another special, yeah, for Netflix. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3705.7s)]
*  And it'll be an hour. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3709.06s)]
*  I'm shooting it soon. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3709.9s)]
*  But I. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3711.86s)]
*  Wow. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3712.7s)]
*  In the next few months. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3713.54s)]
*  The half hour thing they came to me with [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3715.02s)]
*  and they were like, do you wanna do it? [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3717.1400000000003s)]
*  And I just thought it was a cool idea [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3719.34s)]
*  because first of all, I had a half an hour of material [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3721.6600000000003s)]
*  that I didn't wanna put on my next special. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3723.6600000000003s)]
*  So I was like, that's perfect for me. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3725.9s)]
*  And also like, I always wanna try the new thing [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3727.62s)]
*  or the different thing. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3731.3s)]
*  I just wanna try it. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3732.1400000000003s)]
*  I think a lot of people. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3737.1400000000003s)]
*  So my two other specials on Netflix, [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3740.1800000000003s)]
*  Incorrigible and Man on Fire. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3742.82s)]
*  Man on Fire is 60 minutes. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3744.5800000000004s)]
*  Incorrigible is an hour and 20 minutes [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3745.86s)]
*  or an hour and 15 minutes, something like that. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3748.5800000000004s)]
*  I know that. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3750.6600000000003s)]
*  So my first one on Netflix, Incorrigible, [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3753.98s)]
*  I purposely put the banger shit at the end [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3756.98s)]
*  because you close with the banger shit. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3759.6200000000003s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3760.98s)]
*  But I know people didn't get to that [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3762.02s)]
*  because that's a long time to watch stand up. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3764.1800000000003s)]
*  And people watch it before they're gonna go out at night [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3765.9s)]
*  or they're just, they put it on at night [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3768.26s)]
*  and they fall asleep. It's passive, yeah. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3770.6200000000003s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3771.46s)]
*  People watch passively. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3772.46s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3773.46s)]
*  So I know because of that, [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3774.3s)]
*  they'll often reference the first half [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3777.38s)]
*  of that Incorrigible act. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3779.9s)]
*  And I'm like, I know the second half is way funnier. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3781.26s)]
*  So they say, oh, I love the part about this. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3785.46s)]
*  And I'm like, you didn't watch the whole thing. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3787.1400000000003s)]
*  Because the last part is better. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3788.54s)]
*  No one ever talks about the end stuff. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3789.9s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3791.2200000000003s)]
*  So with Man on Fire, it's a little different [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3792.0600000000004s)]
*  because it's an hour. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3793.5800000000004s)]
*  And so I started thinking, [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3795.6600000000003s)]
*  I think people are just trying to consume shit. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3798.1400000000003s)]
*  I think that it's better to click on, [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3801.18s)]
*  oh, it's only a half hour. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3803.3799999999997s)]
*  I'll watch it. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3804.22s)]
*  I got time. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3805.06s)]
*  So I was like, I really wanna do that [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3806.02s)]
*  because I think that'll be a good idea. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3807.46s)]
*  And I had the material. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3808.8999999999996s)]
*  But some people were like, [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3811.3799999999997s)]
*  I think they thought they were being slick. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3813.58s)]
*  They were like, oh dude, [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3814.8599999999997s)]
*  so they're not allowing you to do an hour. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3816.1s)]
*  It's like, you just don't get the business. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=3817.94s)]

*  Oh, he actually started it. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=4504.78s)]
*  He's just banking the episodes and release them. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=4505.62s)]
*  His podcast is gonna be fucking awesome. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=4507.16s)]
*  Really? [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=4509.64s)]
*  I don't know if you would want me to talk about it or not, [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=4510.48s)]
*  but it's fucking awesome. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=4511.84s)]
*  He's got awesome guests. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=4512.68s)]
*  Yeah, it's cool. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=4514.16s)]
*  I can't wait to fucking hear it. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=4515.0s)]
*  Have there been, [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=4516.08s)]
*  has anybody reached out yet about you being a superhero? [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=4518.5199999999995s)]
*  I know this is gonna happen for you. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=4522.8s)]
*  I believe, I'm not joking about that. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=4524.12s)]
*  I know that you're going to be some sort of a superhero. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=4526.0s)]
*  I don't know what the world will be in. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=4528.48s)]
*  Or if you could, [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=4531.2s)]
*  I mean, you could even probably create [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=4532.04s)]
*  your own universe of superheroes, I think. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=4533.24s)]
*  That would be very cool. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=4535.36s)]
*  Yeah, I would love to do that. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=4536.44s)]
*  Because you could do that. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=4538.04s)]
*  I, yeah, no, I haven't been reached out [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=4539.5599999999995s)]
*  for any superhero yet, [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=4542.08s)]
*  but Zachary Levi DM'd me the other day, [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=4543.32s)]
*  so we're getting close. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=4544.88s)]
*  Wow. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=4545.88s)]
*  It's all it takes, man. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=4547.0s)]
*  All it takes, bro. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=4548.84s)]
*  All right, Chris Alia, [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=4550.96s)]
*  thank you so much for being here, man. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=4552.64s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=4553.4800000000005s)]
*  Now I'm just floating on the breeze [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=4554.320000000001s)]
*  and I feel I'm falling like these leaves. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=4556.320000000001s)]
*  I must be cornerstone. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=4559.28s)]
*  Oh, but when I reach that ground, [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=4564.72s)]
*  I'll share this piece of my life. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=4567.24s)]
*  I can feel it in my bones. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=4569.6s)]
*  But it's gonna take a little time [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=4574.68s)]
*  for me to set that parking brake [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=4580.2s)]
*  and let myself unwind. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=4583.12s)]
*  Shine that light on me. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=4586.2s)]
*  I'll sit and tell you my stories. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=4591.92s)]
*  Shine on me. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=4596.92s)]
*  And I will find a song. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=4601.44s)]
*  I will sing it just for you. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=4604.48s)]
*  And now I've been moving way too fast [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=4610.2s)]
*  on the runaway train with a heavy load of my hands. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0MIceGk-w&t=4615.2s)]
