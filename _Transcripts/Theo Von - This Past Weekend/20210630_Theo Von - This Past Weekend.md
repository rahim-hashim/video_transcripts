*  Picture of the thing than even the event is going on. It's more about the meme. It's more about the moment [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=2428.2s)]
*  It's interesting because it's the minutia it's more [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=2439.64s)]
*  But also would anyone even know about the tour de france if this lady wasn't standing there with a sign [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=2448.6s)]
*  Would anybody even know [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=2453.88s)]
*  That these freaking roid monsters who are blowing their nuts out [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=2457.56s)]

*  I mean that you know [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=2472.52s)]

*  It's like a seal with a ball on his nose [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=2478.28s)]
*  You know that dude's one riding bro and he [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=2480.76s)]
*  And at least we knew because he won so many but if the sign shit doesn't maybe it could all be a ploy [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=2487.96s)]
*  It could all be a ploy to get us to watch [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=2497.4s)]
*  so [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=2500.92s)]
*  Here's a couple of uh video questions that came in. I want to thank you guys for sending them in [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=2502.0400000000004s)]
*  What's up guys video quick question my roommate's dating a roller derby chick. She's six three has a [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=2507.0s)]
*  Pretty crazy mullet. It's nothing like yours, but um [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=2514.44s)]
*  She every time she comes home [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=2518.28s)]
*  With my roommate she wants to fight me tickle me. She's always saying really rude things to me [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=2520.52s)]
*  What do you think I should do about this because I can't hit her I can easily beat the shit out of her [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=2526.2s)]
*  But she's pretty big she wants to act like a guy should I treat her like a dude or should I just treat her like a dude [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=2530.2s)]
*  Or should I just treat her like some weirdo at the gas station? [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=2535.16s)]
*  You know I was at the gas station the other night man and it's shit is lit out there [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=2541.24s)]
*  There's a fellow there I swear was bobby lee, okay and bobby will deny it because he's [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=2548.2s)]
*  Sleeping [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=2556.52s)]
*  You know, no wonder you live forever if you're asian if you sleep [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=2559.24s)]
*  21 hours a day then you probably can't live long time [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=2562.9s)]
*  So I think a big gal like that take her back man [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=2571.64s)]
*  I think once a woman gets up over six two, they ought to say it's a man [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=2576.52s)]
*  And i'll say that again, I think once a woman gets up over six two [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=2584.68s)]
*  You know, I don't know how tall you are brother that sent this in blake [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=2588.04s)]
*  You know and thank you for the question brother gang. Praise god [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=2595.56s)]
*  Don't let the lord miss you man [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=2600.84s)]
*  You know, I told someone I say, you know one time I said man i'm really looking for the lord and they said the lord ain't lost [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=2604.68s)]
*  And that hit me that hit me right in the dick man [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=2613.4s)]
*  Sorry, man, i'm really and i'm not sorry [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=2616.68s)]
*  You know, I gotta let some of this stress on everybody i've had so much stress in my neck [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=2622.12s)]
*  And top of my right part of my back for a year and a half [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=2627.0s)]
*  It will not go away [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=2630.7599999999998s)]
*  I do not know what is going on [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=2632.7599999999998s)]
*  I'm 20 days off caffeine right now thinking maybe that could help [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=2636.68s)]
*  So [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=2640.52s)]
*  But i'm not complaining here's what i'm saying bro, I think at a certain point of five three guys should be able to fight a six two woman [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=2643.64s)]
*  And you're thinking about it too right now and you're not really disagreeing so [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=2655.8s)]
*  I think yeah, I think you definitely should not [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=2662.12s)]
*  You know, I think you can take her back though. I think you can like [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=2666.68s)]

*  Aaron uh chalmer [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=2687.8s)]
*  So what the hell, you know, that's where we are [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=2692.36s)]
*  I think as long as you put it online and let people bet on it [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=2696.36s)]
*  You got you could fucking attack her at the house if you want, but I don't know that [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=2699.0s)]

*  I think that's what I would do [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=2729.48s)]

*  What do you look for in in going into an AA where you can really? [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=3904.4s)]

*  Thank you for the call man, this is a cool question my experience with going into an AA meeting [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=3914.84s)]
*  Or my suggestion I would offer to anybody who asked about it would be go to three meetings try out three different ones [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=3922.6800000000003s)]
*  Make sure that one of them is a speaker meeting where somebody is speaking for like an extended period of time [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=3930.08s)]
*  It could be ten minutes or fifteen minutes or sometimes it's thirty minutes forty minutes [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=3936.2000000000003s)]
*  But you want to hear somebody's story [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=3941.66s)]
*  and [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=3944.98s)]
*  Then try some other ones try one. That's a co-ed try one. That's maybe just men or women if you were one of the other [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=3946.7s)]
*  And [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=3958.74s)]
*  And then and then make a decision for yourself [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=3964.58s)]
*  Just because they're different so you want to get it they're not all the same [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=3968.32s)]
*  And [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=3974.0s)]
*  I would just say listen for the difference listen for the similarities not the differences. That's what they say [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=3975.08s)]
*  Listen for the similarities and not the differences [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=3981.2000000000003s)]
*  Because it's easy for me a lot of times to sit there and judge things, you know instead of [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=3984.28s)]
*  Be like what is? [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=3990.04s)]
*  What am I okay with in here? [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=3992.6800000000003s)]
*  Instead of finding all the reasons already why I can't stand something because then I'm just not giving myself a chance [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=3995.46s)]
*  But it's a it's really interesting to go to whether you feel like you have a problem or not [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=4002.4199999999996s)]

*  Wear rush that wear shirts with Russian flags on them because I think they're American communists [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=4960.66s)]
*  It's been said it's been rumored, and I think [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=4968.0199999999995s)]
*  stop pollution [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=4971.38s)]

*  But look I'm trying to global warming is nice when you're at the beach when it's nice and hot let's be honest, but [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=4982.86s)]
*  But in in our in our reality global warming isn't good [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=4988.86s)]
*  Right I agree with you [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=4994.74s)]
*  except when you're at the beach except that but like [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=4997.22s)]
*  So here's the question is do you think enough people are willing to give up going to the beach and having a nice time? [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=5001.1s)]
*  No in order for the world not to global warm no right yeah [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=5006.820000000001s)]

*  What else would go a parent no an attack helicopter? [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=5017.54s)]
*  We we brought our doors driving that who's driving the helicopter the attack helicopter [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=5021.58s)]
*  The whole point of it being in an attack helicopter is because it drives itself and crashes into everything and blows stuff up [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDKT-qhw_Ec&t=5027.780000000001s)]
