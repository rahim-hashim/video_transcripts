*  You know, I'm trying to think of a job that I had that I really [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=1007.4s)]
*  That really really stuck to me [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=1010.96s)]
*  Well, I used to sell Mexican food for a living [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=1014.16s)]
*  In a restaurant or just like knowing a restaurant. Yeah [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=1017.28s)]

*  They did not like cooking Mexican food. So sometimes we would have to literally go tell the tables that we [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=1029.0s)]
*  the chef [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=1035.84s)]
*  Didn't feel like making a quesadilla today [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=1037.6s)]
*  So we would be literally offering like French toast and shit at 5 p.m [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=1041.64s)]

*  Over there and I was so scared of them that I was like afraid of the confrontation and sometimes I would just lock myself away [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=1047.56s)]
*  From some of that because I don't want to be a part of it. Um [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=1056.36s)]

*  You could start in the Broadway with the Rat King himself [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=1071.0400000000002s)]
*  What production would you guys start in and what would your roles be? Oh [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=1075.92s)]
*  Why I've always been told I have a lot of friends on Broadway because I come from the theater world [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=1081.5200000000002s)]
*  I've always been told the only role I could play on Broadway is Pumba from the Lion King [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=1085.3200000000002s)]
*  I don't know why but they're like, that's the only role cuz I bring up a Pumba for you. Yeah [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=1089.6000000000001s)]

*  Yeah, my friend Dodd Loomis actually works [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=1107.48s)]
*  So he does the Lion King if you ever wanted to be that I think you are [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=1109.3600000000001s)]

*  I'm like, I see the eyes and maybe some of the cheek structure [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=1118.1200000000001s)]
*  And I mean that in a very beat [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=1122.88s)]

*  Yeah, the sound is people reaching for that latch under a car hood [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=1145.5200000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I'm like the 90s where people or it didn't just pop up automatically and you have to then it comes up an inch [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=1149.2s)]

*  Microwave because the popcorns already like passed a one or two second mark between the pots and so we know it's just burning [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=1194.7800000000002s)]
*  So the sound is just just running back to the microwave [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=1200.8600000000001s)]
*  Sound of the music. Yeah, listen, I think we could listen when Broadway comes back [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=1205.0600000000002s)]
*  I think this is our moment, you know, I'm trying to get an EGOT [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=1209.7s)]
*  I want a Tony and I've realized like maybe I just need to write my own musical and I can't really sing anymore [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=1212.94s)]
*  Got this deep voice and so I'm like, maybe we do we should actually probably do like a like a straight man play though [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=1217.5800000000002s)]
*  You know something dramatic something where we're both nude, but there's nothing sexual about it [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=1223.22s)]
*  It's just for some reason because I feel like that's the only way you want a tone [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=1227.02s)]
*  Oh, I got a little erectile dysfunction [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=1229.82s)]
*  So don't even have to be something sexual about it if there was it would take a couple episodes [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=1231.3s)]
*  So I'm just gonna let you know. Yeah [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=1234.82s)]
*  so [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=1237.5s)]
*  Tony's [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=1239.9s)]
*  It's called back to back. It's our sex life [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=1241.1000000000001s)]
*  God I'm freezing my eggs both of us facing the other way just ass to ass [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=1245.46s)]
*  Well, let's go back to bat. Yeah, let's go back to that [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=1251.26s)]
*  I mean we can assume that our butts are touching but I think yeah just for like [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=1253.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, the ass-to-ass thing is just gonna be that's gonna make me nervous. Okay, I feel you I respect that [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=1258.3s)]
*  Didn't mean to push that on you [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=1263.22s)]
*  Really apologize. Well, I thought you were Pisces. I thought we were vibing but okay [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=1265.9s)]
*  So no dissolve. Oh, what else would we be the sound of music that we said such is it was such a great question [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=1269.78s)]
*  So what else you know, what other kind of show could we be if it was a we could do like Hello Dolly now? [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=1275.54s)]
*  I don't know what you know about musicals, but we could I mean Hello Dolly is like this very iconic old show [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=1281.02s)]
*  It's southern. Is it southern? No, it's not southern. Never mind [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=1285.9s)]
*  But it's I mean we I could see you in like a hoop skirt [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=1289.5800000000002s)]
*  Having a moment, you know with like a hat on and like a like a pipe or something. Okay. Yeah, you're a little old-timey [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=1292.6200000000001s)]
*  Okay, okay. Okay. I'm gonna go with this. I think we could do like a I don't know Hello Dolly, but I've been a Dollywood once [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=1298.3799999999999s)]
*  Oh fuck. Yeah [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=1305.5s)]
*  If you're gonna hello Dollywood, I could play Dolly Parton. Yes [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=1306.94s)]
*  So this is our pitch and Broadway we would like some funds [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=1312.66s)]
*  What is your Dolly part and you just part your hair like so severely? Yeah, and it's um now that's not a good one [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=1316.26s)]
*  Yeah, but you know that thing now is that these young kids on tik-tok are telling women I'm 34 [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=1323.06s)]
*  They're saying that we can't do a side part anymore. They're like no, it's only a middle part. We can't wear skinny jeans anymore [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=1328.1399999999999s)]
*  It's like this whole fucking thing that these young girls are trying to tell us how to dictate our life and our aesthetic [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=1332.94s)]
*  And I'm fucking pissed about this. Have you heard about it? [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=1338.22s)]
*  I haven't heard about that and I'm also glad I haven't heard about that because it seems like it's it's a little shit [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=1340.1799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, and it's okay. I'm glad that women are doing stuff, but I don't want to know about [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=1344.62s)]
*  I [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=1348.34s)]
*  Love that women are telling other women what they're doing wrong because that's feminism [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=1349.9s)]
*  Yeah, that's what we need. We need more. I think it should let I want to see it spill out into the streets [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=1354.78s)]
*  I would love to see here's what I'll here's where it is. Okay is a couple of 19 or 70 year old women getting [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=1360.06s)]
*  abused by some 30 year old women is a street path [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=1367.7s)]
*  Listen I went back to my story at Ole Miss like before rush and they wanted me to give like a motivational speech [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=1373.54s)]
*  And I literally no way really I scared so were you the head of your story? [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=1377.82s)]

*  Like maybe maybe it's the lord telling me like slow your fucking roll do something else for somebody [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=3577.8399999999997s)]

*  And and I hadn't seen her in almost a year and a half and it was just very difficult [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=5119.12s)]
*  I'm an only child [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=5123.4400000000005s)]

*  Um and find a place that has some assisted [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=5148.08s)]

*  To come in to yeah honor moving's expensive and help like nursing is so expensive [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=5160.08s)]
*  So I I hear you it's we looked into it for a family friend [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=5166.5599999999995s)]

*  And then I never had a panic attack in my life [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=5574.4s)]
*  But for some reason like just the energy of baltimore [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=5576.4s)]
*  I had a panic attack right before I went out on stage and I had to start the show and like work through it [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SKOhc9ziw&t=5578.88s)]
