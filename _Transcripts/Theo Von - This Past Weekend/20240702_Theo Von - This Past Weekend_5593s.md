*  Today's guest is Mr. KSI. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=73.08s)]
*  How are you, bro? How are you finding England? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=84.48s)]
*  Huh? How you finding England? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=109.48s)]
*  Oh, I'm finding it. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=111.48s)]
*  Yeah, one of the probably one of the best audiences I ever had over in Manchester, actually. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=113.48s)]
*  Wow. Yeah. Yeah, they're pretty wild over there. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=117.48s)]
*  They were everybody. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=119.48s)]
*  Yeah. Just laughing. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=121.48s)]
*  Like the last week of school where you're just hoping you can convince the teacher, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=123.48s)]
*  like you have four more days to convince the teacher you were good the whole time. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=127.48s)]
*  Oh, wow. They were just on it. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=131.48000000000002s)]
*  They were just locked in, man. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=134.48000000000002s)]
*  Because yeah, some places it's kind of different, like Ireland sometimes, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=136.48000000000002s)]
*  you're like, because they speak English, but they kind of barely, you know. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=139.48s)]
*  Yeah, it feels like a different language. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=143.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=145.48s)]
*  Even in Scotland as well, it can be quite hard. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=147.48s)]
*  You should have you ever met a Scouser? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=150.48s)]
*  No, I've seen Patti Pimlet. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=153.48s)]
*  Yeah, it's pretty much that. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=155.48s)]
*  But in Liverpool, it can be quite, yeah, it can be really aggressive. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=157.48s)]
*  Patti Pimlet kind of reminds me of like the most violent Beatle. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=162.48s)]
*  Like if he were one of the Beatles, you know, it would be like Ringo, McCartney, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=164.48s)]
*  Oh, I thought you meant an actual Beatle. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=168.48s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=171.48s)]
*  Yeah, but this is showing my age. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=172.48s)]
*  I'm like, yeah. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=174.48s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, that's a different. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=175.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=176.48s)]
*  So we're back to Bugs. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=177.48s)]
*  Yeah, they were just they were one of the most famous bands in the world for a bit. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=178.48s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah, of course. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=182.48s)]
*  I mean, they've kind of I guess they have maybe fallen off. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=184.48s)]
*  I don't know if we can say that. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=186.48s)]
*  For fuck, they're the Beatles, man. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=189.48s)]
*  I mean, do those type of eyes ever fall off? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=193.48s)]
*  I guess it's a good question. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=196.48s)]
*  Have the Beatles fallen off? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=198.48s)]
*  I mean, technically, yes. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=200.48s)]
*  But if you said that, like, surely again, riots at your front door. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=203.48s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think, yeah, there would be some people definitely run to their windows in Liverpool and scoff or whatever. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=209.48s)]
*  Yeah, like that's one thing like. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=215.48s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=218.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=221.48s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=222.48s)]
*  Like a woman just will touch that even though her buttons already buttoned, she'll touch it one more time just to make sure. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=227.48s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=233.48s)]
*  How dare you? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=234.48s)]
*  That's one thing that's crazy about being over here is just like seeing where like America started, you know. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=236.48s)]
*  OK. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=242.48s)]
*  And seeing like how like a little bit more technical things are and people have a little bit more respect for how they communicate with each other. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=243.48s)]
*  It seems like at least in London. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=251.48s)]
*  Yeah, no, I feel like it's come out. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=253.48s)]
*  I feel like if you go up to a normal person like just walking down the road and you go, oh, good morning. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=255.48s)]
*  Everyone would be like, what the fuck are you doing here? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=262.48s)]
*  Yes. Oh, wow. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=265.48s)]
*  That'd be like that was one of the weirdest things you've ever done. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=266.48s)]
*  Oh, don't talk to me. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=269.48s)]
*  Yeah. Like in America, you happens all the time. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=271.48s)]
*  Like I was in North Carolina a few weeks ago and people just complimented on what I was wearing. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=275.48s)]
*  I was like, what the fuck? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=282.48s)]
*  This is weird. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=283.48s)]
*  But in England, it would be if I complimented, I was there like, oh, nice shoes. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=284.48s)]
*  You're there like, I'm getting robbed, aren't I? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=291.48s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=294.48s)]
*  But at least they're properly robbing you like, hey, I'd like to let you know you have nice shoes. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=295.48s)]
*  I'm going to take them. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=299.48s)]
*  I feel like there's at least a protocol of violence here. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=301.48s)]
*  Okay. What in America is there no protocol? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=305.48s)]
*  It's just willy nilly. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=307.48s)]
*  It's just bang bang. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=308.48s)]
*  Yeah. Even if you like, yeah, it's crazy because they'll even have like the telephones like at the Apple store will be tethered, right? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=309.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=317.48s)]
*  But at the gun place, you can just, you know, you can, they're not even tied down. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=318.48s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=323.48s)]
*  You would think. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=324.48s)]
*  Well, apparently you don't even need ID for guns. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=325.48s)]
*  But you have to at least you have to, you have to be able to say yes, I need it. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=328.48s)]
*  You have to answer a couple of questions. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=332.48s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=333.48s)]
*  You can say yes. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=334.48s)]
*  Yeah. And they have one sign. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=338.48s)]
*  It's like you have to be this tall to own a gun, but it's very short. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=339.48s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=343.48s)]
*  So you get up like a five year old is just a tall five year old. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=346.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=350.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=351.48s)]
*  A small one. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=352.48s)]
*  I know how to use one of these. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=353.48s)]
*  I love it. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=354.48s)]
*  I love it. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=355.48s)]
*  No, I'm amazing. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=356.48s)]
*  I've been there so many times. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=357.48s)]
*  Dude, it's such a, it's a, it's a pleasure to see you, man. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=358.48s)]
*  One of the, one of the like best content creators and entertainers in England and like, and a [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=360.48s)]
*  business guy. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=368.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=369.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=370.48s)]
*  Dude, that's crazy. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=371.48s)]
*  It's funny because England is so small. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=372.48s)]
*  Oh, it is. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=373.48s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=376.48s)]
*  But so mighty. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=377.48s)]
*  Compared to America. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=378.48s)]
*  Like if you said that exact same phrase, but in America, everyone's there. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=379.48s)]
*  I was there like, yo, that's sick. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=384.48s)]
*  But England is like, bro, like France is bigger than America. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=387.48s)]
*  So, yeah. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=390.48s)]
*  Sorry, dude. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=391.48s)]
*  No, no, it's fine. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=392.48s)]
*  I don't know, honestly. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=393.48s)]

*  like just cause like having vision like that is interesting and important. You know, like, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=604.36s)]
*  well, I mean, I can tell you a bad situation, uh, where I decided to do this video with some [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=607.96s)]
*  Asian content creator. It was, I don't know why I did it. I think, well, I did know why I did it [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=618.52s)]
*  because I got asked to do it for about like 5k at the time. And for me back then was huge. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=624.84s)]
*  Oh, it's a lot of money. So I'd just be in this video and I had to like collect balls [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=632.44s)]
*  while being attached to him. So I was also in like Lycra or is or just like a really tight [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=639.48s)]

*  That sounds very poor Billy Elliot back up. I think. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=661.88s)]
*  God. So now we've each had, um, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=665.48s)]
*  so that was the one I probably regret. I'm sure if you look hard on the internet, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=669.5600000000001s)]

*  about like, uh, just having to be, let's say if they had to be, I know disabled and they weren't [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=740.9200000000001s)]

*  watching the commercial for it. Right. And then at the end, the guy gets up and walks off out of the [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=753.72s)]
*  chair. I'd be a little bit like, well, that's a magic chair. Yeah. Yeah. So maybe like, um, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=758.04s)]

*  of mine who's a comedian in the state. He told me one time, the one thing you can always say is just [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=778.4399999999999s)]
*  no. Like if you don't know what to do, then just say no, because you're probably okay where you're [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=781.96s)]
*  at and then you can figure it out. Um, yeah. Well, I feel like I've, I've got quite far, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=786.44s)]

*  yourself? I mean, that's remarkable. I don't think it's changed me as a person, but it's changed my [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=808.12s)]
*  lifestyle. Yeah. Yeah. I just have a lot more private jets now. Yeah. Yeah. More private jets. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=813.24s)]

*  like, I can really just do what I want. Whereas, uh, you know, before prime I'm, I'm still like, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=832.2s)]
*  I was still able to do what I want, but like I had to be more strategic, et cetera. And you know, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=840.6800000000001s)]

*  it's that it's valued at billions of dollars at company. It's, well, it's, it's taken us a lot of, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=852.6s)]
*  a lot of hard work to get to that point. It's just, I think people don't realize, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=857.32s)]
*  cause you see people trying to replicate left, right and center, just the marketing you have to [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=861.0s)]
*  do. Like especially the first year we traveled so much from America to Europe to all these different [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=865.24s)]
*  places just to promote like day after day, like just doing appearances and just doing PR, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=873.96s)]
*  let find center just to constantly get prime in people's faces. Like it's, it was intense and like, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=879.64s)]
*  yeah, it's quite draining on the body, but like, you know, we knew the vision. We knew we had a [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=887.64s)]
*  product that was going to fly. You know, it tastes great and you know, it's bad than our competitors. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=893.3199999999999s)]
*  So yeah, my nephew has two primes before he goes to sleep. Okay. Yeah. And he's doing pretty good. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=899.4799999999999s)]
*  He's, um, he has his dreams. He said are pretty good. So I think that's why he enjoys it as like [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=905.3199999999999s)]
*  kind of a dream enhancer, but he's kind of a unique kid, but I think he's only about eight or nine, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=911.7199999999999s)]
*  but yeah, he'll put away some prime before bed. Um, but yeah, I think it's just wild when something [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=916.04s)]
*  like that happens and people don't see how much has to go into it. How many like just places you [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=922.76s)]
*  have to show up at appearances. Um, whose, whose plan was prime? Was it just you guys had come [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=927.8s)]

*  photos. You usually just photo or say something. Sometimes somebody wants to share, like maybe they [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=1161.24s)]
*  had an experience that you've talked about on podcasting. Cause we talk about a lot of just [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=1165.24s)]
*  regular life stuff on you. And so sometimes you'll have people say, Hey man, you know, this is an [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=1169.24s)]
*  experience that was going on in my life and it was similar to yours and stuff. And sometimes that's [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=1173.64s)]
*  the toughest part about popularity in some ways is you used to have more time for that kind of thing, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=1178.04s)]
*  you know, but now you could run into somebody on every block and you could spend your whole day [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=1183.96s)]
*  kind of like listening to some of the stories. So you have to just try and manage your best, [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=1188.2s)]
*  you know, I think in dealing with that. Would you, would you say, I mean, this might be deep, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=1192.92s)]
*  but do you think popularity is a prison? Yeah. Oh, wow. Yeah. I think it's a, it's a responsibility. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=1199.0s)]
*  It's interesting. It's kind of an escape room maybe. Okay. Um, because I think you can figure [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=1208.6000000000001s)]
*  out how to manage it, but I think it surprises you. You there's different levels of it. You're like, [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=1213.72s)]
*  okay, people see me now and then it's kind of fun. And then there's times where I think it gets kind [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=1219.24s)]
*  of scary. Yeah. Yeah. Um, and I'm sure at your level, you get to the point where you almost, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=1223.0800000000002s)]
*  you have to fly private because it's, you couldn't cause a scene. Well, it's just because it just, [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=1228.3600000000001s)]
*  it'd be easier. Right. That's what I mean. Like for me, I, a lot of times I do things just to make [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=1234.1200000000001s)]
*  my life as easy as possible because I mean, you know, I can easily take an economy flight, [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=1240.0400000000002s)]
*  left, right. And I probably will when I have a kid because I don't want them to think, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=1245.8s)]
*  Oh, you know, PJs are the norm. Like I wouldn't want my child thinking, you know, all these [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=1251.96s)]
*  crazy things that I do. Yeah. That kid's going to be on a mule back. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=1258.68s)]
*  Fucking is taking this. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=1263.3999999999999s)]
*  Uh, yeah. We're taking a bus. We're going to walk. Kids are going to be like, why are all these [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=1269.48s)]
*  people just staring at us? Dad, why do I have this? Why am I in this wheelchair? We're slowing it [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=1275.4s)]
*  down. So go through it. But no, I think the, yep. That popularity is it. It's interesting. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=1281.8000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. It's a, yeah. Like, I mean, would you trade if you could keep your finances, would you [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=1288.52s)]
*  trade your popularity? You think? Oh, a hundred percent. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. I, if I could just keep [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=1294.0400000000002s)]
*  all the money I have and not be famous, I'd do that easily. Yeah. But there's, it's crazy. Like [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=1298.6000000000001s)]
*  you get a lot of people who have a lot of money want fame and they don't, I don't think they [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=1304.12s)]
*  realize that it's a lot of responsibility because you have so many people that look up to you. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=1308.6799999999998s)]
*  And as a human being, you're going to fuck up. Yeah. So as soon as you fuck up, bro, the onslaught, [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=1314.6799999999998s)]
*  the mob, it's just, it's so much to deal with. And then should then have to rectify it and fix [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=1322.6s)]
*  it and show the world that, you know, you are human and that you're going to improve and learn [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=1329.88s)]
*  from your mistakes, et cetera. Yeah. It's a lot, man. It goes, you know, I've, I've gone through [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=1334.6000000000001s)]
*  that so many times, you know, like where I've messed up so many times because it's just, I'm, [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=1339.0s)]
*  yeah. Once you had a product that was a bigger, because then it's almost a responsibility that [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=1344.2800000000002s)]
*  your behavior could even affect the exactly that has to be a whole nother different. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=1348.8400000000001s)]
*  So like, imagine if prime was on the stock market. Yeah. And you know, I, [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=1353.56s)]
*  I dunno, I like, I said something that just pissed off a load of people, [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=1360.1200000000001s)]
*  all of a sudden, arsenal fans or something. Well, if you pissed off a bunch of like, yeah, like, [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=1364.92s)]

*  you know, yeah, yeah, yeah. So yeah, like that, imagine they just plummet my stock because of it. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=1375.24s)]
*  Yeah. I have to be so careful. I have to be so like, Oh, everyone is great. And like, [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=1381.8s)]
*  I have no real opinion. Yeah. Yeah. It's weird because you kind of trade a party. You [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=1387.3999999999999s)]
*  more of you gets traded away in a way. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. That makes sense. And yeah, [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=1394.44s)]
*  not trying to complain about things, but trying to see it's interesting having a life where in [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=1398.52s)]
*  your life you have some popularity or you have fame. It's just interesting to even see what it's [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=1403.0s)]
*  like. Like, not that it's even if it's happening to you, it's just, you're still like, it's just, [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=1407.64s)]
*  it's interesting to be like, okay, this is what this is like, but don't get me wrong. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=1413.0800000000002s)]
*  There are pros as well. Like, if I, you know, let's say I want to go to a restaurant and it's [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=1417.0s)]
*  fully booked, you know, I hit up my PA and all of a sudden there's a slot. You know what I mean? [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=1422.5200000000002s)]
*  Like that's the benefit of, you know, being, uh, having fame. Like it gives you opportunities [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=1427.16s)]
*  and more opportunities. But then I guess you have a load of money. You can just buy the restaurant [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=1434.6s)]
*  and then it's always free. No matter what. Yeah. That's a good fight, dude. So, [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=1439.48s)]
*  um, what else was I thinking about? I wanted to ask you, um, [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=1448.6s)]

*  depending on what kind of time of year it is. In the fall, I'm more likely to let a woman, [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=1468.2s)]
*  this, this lovely hair cutter lady I know cut it in the spring. I tend to cut my own hair. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=1473.0800000000002s)]
*  You know, you, you cut your own hair. Yeah. I was cut my own, you know, cut it, lift it, cut it. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=1479.5600000000002s)]

*  cut it. And then you do the same as many places as you can, you know, surely like it's a bit all [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=1491.32s)]
*  over the place. Oh, it doesn't look great, but you know, but you've done it. Yeah. And I enjoy it [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=1497.72s)]
*  because I'm in the, I'm in the kind of guy who I'll be looking in the mirror, like I need to [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=1503.96s)]

*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2275.56s)]
*  Put a prime in there. Put a prime in his head. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2276.36s)]
*  Let's go down and I'll give you the fight of your life. You're good for nothing. Bogman's bastard. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2280.36s)]
*  Yeah. These guys are great. Yeah. Very intense. You want an apology, you get no fucking apologies. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2284.2s)]
*  It's just families for years that have been fighting. Yeah. And making these videos. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2289.8s)]
*  Wow. Dude, did you see the guy who, um, have you, have you ever been involved with these guys? [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2294.44s)]
*  Um, luckily no. Uh, yeah. I, I started to stay away from all of that. I just, I feel like it's a [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2299.96s)]
*  lot of work. Oh yeah. But that's an easy promo video. I mean, that guy cut that in two, three [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2307.48s)]
*  minutes. Yeah. Parking lot. But I don't know. No budget. Do I, do I need that in my life? I don't [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2313.08s)]
*  know. I mean, I just think if you started promoting that sort of thing, could that be the next thing? [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2319.4s)]
*  Well, I don't know. I think it'd be very weird if we start promoting that with the sidemen. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2322.6s)]
*  That's true. But if it were Sidemen versus Trapp, like straight up real deal, Joe Joyce, [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2328.68s)]
*  grandchildren, Trapp. I'd be able to hold my own, but I feel like the others would, [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2334.4399999999996s)]
*  would fail tremendously. I think it'd be interesting to watch though. Um, yeah. When you look at like, [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2338.12s)]
*  cause a lot of like celebrity fighting started, um, like Muhammad Ali did it a long time ago. I know. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2344.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. And then they had, uh, George Foreman, George Foreman did it. So it's been, did you kind [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2350.8399999999997s)]
*  of get those ideas from that? Or was it just something you guys like, that was a world you [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2356.76s)]
*  wanted to get into? Um, I think because of us just entering the world in general with the whole [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2360.36s)]
*  YouTuber thing, like me, fighting Joe Weller, then Logan Paul, et cetera. It just made sense to create [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2367.32s)]
*  our own organization. Misfits where, you know, I feel like the name is perfect for it. Misfits. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2374.28s)]
*  It's just, it's different to everything and it's its own thing and people just love it. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2381.24s)]
*  Yeah. It's just entertaining. We just make fights that people, you know, wanted to see for years [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2388.68s)]
*  happen, or we just make things like tag team fights happen, et cetera. We just, we don't care, [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2394.2799999999997s)]
*  but we just want to make it entertaining. Entertainment. Are you on the board that [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2401.4799999999996s)]
*  chooses the fights or how do you guys do it? Um, not really. Like I, I normally approve of fights, [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2406.6s)]
*  but a lot of times Mams is in charge of that. So with me, I'm the one that actually does the fight. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2413.7999999999997s)]
*  So as in like, I actually fight. Oh yeah. You fight. I know you fought. No, no, no. But as in like, [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2420.6s)]
*  I that that's more my forte as of now. And then when I take the batman and maybe I'll be more [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2425.88s)]
*  invested, but for now, Mams is just the guy who really sets the fights up and Mams is all like, [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2433.0s)]
*  his small council. I see. Wow. And Mams is my manager. Got it. Yeah. Yeah. Um, [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2439.72s)]
*  when you see that Mike Perry's in this new fight for suddenly for me, I was way more excited. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2447.0s)]
*  Uh, I think you'd much rather fight an old man. Yeah. It's just, it's just so much easier. Why [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2453.4s)]
*  would he fight? Yeah. Why would he fight? Did you see the fight between, um, uh, silver and [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2459.24s)]
*  what was that? What was that? It's what was that? What was that? It was Patty cake. It was, it was, [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2471.0s)]
*  it was checking someone's pockets for their phone. That's what I mean. That's who Jake [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2481.3199999999997s)]
*  Paul fought. Like these are the people that Jay Paul fight. And I, that's why I'm like, [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2485.4s)]
*  why would he now go into a super hard fight? Well, at some point it has to be that if you, [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2489.8s)]
*  cause he really pushes himself very hard that he's a boxer. No, he pushes himself as the legend [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2496.12s)]
*  killer. Oh, I see. That's the angle he's going. So he said like, I destroy all these legends when [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2503.1600000000003s)]
*  the 50 because that's who I am. I'm Jake Paul. Slayer of senior citizens. That's, that's, [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2509.0s)]
*  that's his forte. He's like osteoporosis. So that's why I like him find my parents. Like, [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2518.68s)]

*  he has like, it's almost like he has extra necks inside of his net, you know? Cause you're like, [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2551.7200000000003s)]

*  watching him. It's like, you almost I'll be sitting there watching him and I'll start doing it. You [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2565.7200000000003s)]
*  know, it's just like, uh, have you seen it? Yeah. It's, you don't talk about, he's like, [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2570.84s)]
*  he's got his own thing going on. His own style. Yeah. Cause a lot of fighters, they're like, [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2580.12s)]
*  you know, it's just like, he's like, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh bro. It's crazy with the neck. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2585.0s)]

*  Like you were an MVP starts moving that neck all of a sudden. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2615.0s)]
*  No, I'm a huge fan. That's been one of the neatest things I think about getting like just [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2623.4s)]
*  becoming a UFC fan over the past few years, man. Have you been to the fights? Yeah, [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2628.2s)]

*  Yeah. There's one coming up in Manchester. Yeah. It's very good. God dude. It's so much fun. Isn't [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2637.48s)]
*  it? Oh, it's brutal. It's a, it's bro. Actually what was crazy for me was, you know, as a British [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2642.52s)]
*  guy, I went to the UFC in Miami, two nine nine. Bro. Well, that was poor. Yeah. Versus Ben was [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2650.68s)]
*  a guy. Yeah. So that fight was insane. Yeah. But oh my God, when Trump came in, bro, I didn't expect [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2660.04s)]
*  everyone to scream like that, bro. It was the loudest cheer of the whole night. Oh yeah. I [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2667.88s)]
*  didn't know people love Trump like that. People love him. Oh, we're here. For us, we think everyone [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2672.92s)]
*  hates Trump and he's like, ah, you know, Trump bad. I go over there. Oh my God. It's like he's Jesus. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2678.52s)]
*  Yeah. He's like, yeah, he's kind of like a, uh, like a little bit of like a, yeah, like a, [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2687.2400000000002s)]
*  but Jesus, but yeah, people love him. When he comes in at UFC, people love him, [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2694.36s)]
*  but the media doesn't like him in America. Okay. But the people are more and more like him. Oh, [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2698.12s)]
*  well I'm not, I'm not in the politics. I know. Fuck all. People used to hate him, but I think [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2704.12s)]
*  sometimes the politics is interesting now. Yeah. But, uh, I'm too stupid for it. Yeah. Yeah. As in [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2708.36s)]
*  like, imagine if I, if I became, you will one day, no, you'll become a politician. If I, if I became [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2714.12s)]
*  a prime minister, then it's over for the world, man. Well, for England anyway, for who specifically [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2720.92s)]
*  well, let's take them out by city. Let's go. I'll probably be like, okay. Um, no, no more taxes. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2728.28s)]
*  I'll be like, no more taxes. No one, no more, no more taxes. Then all of a sudden NHS is just [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2737.64s)]
*  there like, all right, now what guys, what do we do? We're, we're struggling. We, we have no funding. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2743.0s)]
*  And I'm like, oh shit. Uh, instantly I'm in a hole. So for me, when it comes to policies, [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2747.8s)]
*  you're like, uh, unlimited prime for everyone. That might not be bad. No taxes, free prime. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2760.6000000000004s)]
*  You could win on that campaign. That's what's crazy. No taxes, free prime. That's what's crazy. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2768.44s)]
*  That is why. Well, the craziest thing about Trump is like, he was always kind of a shady [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2773.16s)]
*  businessman. He was always, I think everybody regarded him as that. But Hollywood built him [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2777.16s)]
*  up because they had a show called the, um, the boss or something. The apprentice. I do remember. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2782.12s)]
*  So Hollywood made him this big thing. And then they got pissed when he like one president, [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2790.12s)]
*  they're like, what the fuck? Then Hollywood was like, fuck him. You built him. It's true. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2795.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. So, but now people I think are more honest. I just think it's getting weird. The guy we have [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2801.64s)]
*  is not doing good. And it's just a bit much over there. Um, but the social media kind of controls [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2807.24s)]
*  everything. It feels like these days. Yeah. So she really has a lot of power in, in just, [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2813.3199999999997s)]
*  in how people think I feel like, for example, even with Instagram, you can just, you know, [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2819.0s)]
*  let's say you're a woman, you go on Instagram and you're just seeing all these women [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2826.52s)]
*  like looking 10 out of 10, but they've all had worked on. And it's just like the way to get to [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2831.4s)]
*  that level is you have to get worked on. Eventually your mind's going to think, oh, maybe I need to [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2838.84s)]
*  get filler. Maybe I need to, you know, do, do this with my eyes or do this with my cheeks and stuff [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2843.1600000000003s)]
*  like that to get to that level. It's slow, but it slowly like takes over people's minds. And that's [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2849.32s)]
*  why you need to just, you know, definitely step back sometimes and just be like, nah, man, like [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2855.0s)]
*  I'm happy with how with myself, I'm happy with my way of thinking, but because it's just social [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2860.7599999999998s)]
*  media, it's just everywhere and it's kind of like becoming everything. It's kind of getting harder [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2867.0s)]
*  and harder to do that. Yeah. Oh, I, yeah, I would feel horrible because you'll see a lot of young [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2870.92s)]
*  girls getting lip filler. I hate it. I hate it. I mean, I saw one day having soup and it just [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2875.3199999999997s)]
*  unhaving soup. Like I've never seen fucking like, what are we doing here? [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2882.68s)]
*  Oh, like I, like I've, I've told my girlfriend, like, please never in your life ever do anything [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2889.0s)]
*  like, she's like every now and then she's like, oh, I'm thinking of, I'm like, no, don't you dare. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=2897.08s)]

*  set them somewhere else. And it seems like they would stay there where you put them. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=3875.64s)]
*  You know, they're just so like, they are so nice. Well, it's, it's weird. Like to the point where [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=3880.3599999999997s)]
*  there was one point where we were going to restaurant, we ate there and we, you know, [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=3885.56s)]

*  they bow, then you bow. But then since you bowed, they bow again. And so it really becomes like, [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=3908.92s)]
*  you know, it's like watching a penguin's arms or whatever. It just gets really bizarre. I think. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=3915.0s)]

*  something bad to happen to do with AI. Like, I don't know if a bad thing did happen. Like [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=4560.44s)]
*  I don't know. And AI just became smart and said, I, I'm going to just hack everything. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=4568.599999999999s)]

*  AI started to be like, fuck everybody. Yeah. I mean, and it started just sending emails to [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=4589.88s)]
*  the other people. Didn't want it just decided. Well, imagine it was just, they just love trolling. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=4595.08s)]

*  a good movie concept. It might be hard to pull off. Yeah. But yeah, if you had AI, a troller, [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=4605.0s)]
*  that's what they chose to do. Did you, did you troll when you were younger? [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=4610.6s)]
*  I didn't troll that much. I don't think, you know, I mean, at first they didn't even have the [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=4614.04s)]
*  internet when I was a little kid. So you couldn't even, you just had to call somebody a name right [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=4619.64s)]
*  in front of them. You had to be there in person. You had to show up and do it. Yeah. You had to put [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=4623.0s)]
*  in the work. Okay. Well you can send letter. Yeah. I guess you could, yeah, you could do a letter. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=4629.240000000001s)]
*  Letter was kind of fun as well because we had a lot of pedophiles and stuff in our area. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=4635.72s)]
*  And so we would often send letters to, you know, I'd send letters to my friends and say they were [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=4639.4s)]
*  from the, and like my friend's dad would be like, why the fuck is this guy sending you a letter? [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=4643.719999999999s)]
*  You know, creating shit around the home or whatever, kind of creating intrigue around the home. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=4647.879999999999s)]
*  What do you feel like, like, I mean, people are always saying like, what's next? Do you feel okay [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=4654.759999999999s)]
*  coming back from your break? Like what do you, do you, do you feel like invigorated? Was it hard to, [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=4658.04s)]
*  because taking a break is big. I've thought for years, I'm going to take a break and it's very [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=4665.16s)]
*  hard to. The scary thing is we've taken a break is if you step off the treadmill, [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=4667.96s)]
*  do you think you'll be able to get back on it? Do you think you'll be as fit to get back on it? [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=4674.36s)]
*  What do you think you'll just hop on and fall off? Yeah. And that's for me. I feel like, [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=4679.24s)]
*  yeah, I'm at a point where I've like stepped off the treadmill before I'd say around 2017, [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=4687.56s)]
*  where I took like a super long break and then came back and everything was all right. So I was [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=4695.4s)]
*  like, oh, okay. Like I'm in a place now where I can take a break and it's okay. So I feel like a [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=4700.44s)]
*  lot of like YouTubers or streamers or whatever, like always worried that they might not reach [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=4707.0s)]
*  the same level they're at if they take a break. So they decide to never take a break. But then [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=4714.599999999999s)]
*  they go crazy. Like Fousey died at the mall or whatever. He went nuts, bro. But he's gone nuts [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=4721.08s)]
*  before. He's done this and crashed down and then he's done this again and crashed down. So like [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=4728.6s)]
*  it's, yeah, it's wild. And the pressure of those, like that's constant streaming. You weren't even [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=4735.32s)]
*  at that. You weren't like that. You're more of a vlogger. Right? Is that safe to say? Yeah. What's [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=4740.92s)]
*  the term? I mean, I know you do a lot of stuff. Yeah. I mean, nowadays I just sit in front of a [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=4746.84s)]
*  camera and laugh. So that's, that's pretty much right. That's like, but it's infectious and [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=4750.68s)]
*  people like it job description in terms of YouTube that it's that. Right. And then, [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=4755.0s)]
*  but you didn't have to ever sit there like Kai Sanet or those guys where they're doing that [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=4760.2s)]
*  seven hour stream. I did use to stream. Oh, I didn't know that when I was younger. No, but like [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=4764.2s)]
*  it's not that huge, like part of my life. It was like, I did it for about, I'd say a year or so, [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=4769.16s)]
*  like I just stream games and stuff. Like this was 2012, 2013 when streaming wasn't really as big as [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=4777.72s)]
*  it is now. So yeah, I was, you know, I did streaming, you know, I did YouTube videos, [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=4784.76s)]
*  but I did everything. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you kind of have a, I'm like a mystery. You have your own [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=4790.28s)]
*  thing. Yeah. I'm definitely not Mr. Beast. Mr. Beast is on a completely different level, bro. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=4794.92s)]
*  Did you see him in North Carolina? Yeah. You did. So that's why I went. Yeah. That's what I was [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=4799.88s)]
*  thinking. Yeah. I went there for a YouTube, like, like those 50 YouTubers and he put in a box and [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=4803.08s)]
*  just chaos and only one could survive. Yeah, man. It's crazy. Different challenges. So you were [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=4811.96s)]
*  competing against other people. Yeah. Yeah. I was a menace man. I was just there for me. My idea was [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=4818.28s)]
*  I'm going to demon. Well, I kind of like, I'm naturally just a nice guy anyway. So like, [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=4823.8s)]
*  you know, I went to hi everyone. It was cool to see old faces left, right. And so, [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=4830.6s)]
*  but then, you know, as soon as the cameras are on and they're like, I'm just going to be content. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=4835.24s)]
*  Yeah. My goal is just content. Like people trying to sleep. I'm shouting in their ears, [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=4840.360000000001s)]
*  like, yo, no sleeping tonight, baby. Wake the fuck up. Yeah. Yeah, bro. And the thing is, [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=4845.96s)]
*  because everyone there is a little timid and everyone's a bit standoffish, a bit reserved [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=4851.96s)]
*  because, you know, everyone's a big YouTube in their own right. Like people have got 20 million, [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=4856.84s)]

*  one channel, 20 something and then another like 16 something, whatever. But I don't give a shit, [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=4868.04s)]
*  bro. Like for me, I'm there. Like, I'm just there here to just have a good fucking time. Like, [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=4873.64s)]
*  obviously, you know, some people really wanted to win like the one million. It was a grand prize [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=4879.64s)]
*  of one million. But for me, bro, I was just there. Like, I'm here just to have a good fucking time. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=4885.72s)]

*  The thing, the challenges, but yeah, it was, it was, it was definitely cool to see [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=4895.4800000000005s)]
*  different YouTubers. Was it inspiring to see MrBeast create something like that? [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=4900.92s)]
*  Like he showed me round Greenville, like the different areas that he's bought just for videos. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=4904.919999999999s)]
*  Insane, bro. Oh, man just spent like, I don't even know I can say this, but he spent like millions [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=4913.16s)]
*  on just a bit of land for one video, just like that. And it's just like, he's happy just to do that. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=4920.839999999999s)]
*  And then he, the money that he makes from that puts it into another video. He just like, he [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=4927.799999999999s)]

*  me because the idea of like space travel, like becomes a thing. Like imagine we can just take [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=5215.8s)]
*  with AI, you mean, Oh, because it'll tell us how to do it. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=5222.44s)]

*  Mars. Right. We have like practice humans then it's like, you have a crash test dummy that can [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=5236.52s)]

*  We won't even have to be the aliens. We'll just create them. Yes. And then we'd be able to like [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=5268.92s)]
*  just conquer different planets. What about, so if certain countries get the robots and the robots [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=5274.92s)]
*  will fight the wars for them. Oh shit. Yeah. But then, but then how would that work? Then it was [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=5281.24s)]
*  just right. Nobody would win really. Yeah. It just, but it would be a whole new league of sports though. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=5287.4s)]

*  you consider a humanoid robot as human. It would have to depend on how human, if it puts its makeup [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=5312.2s)]
*  on, then I would say yes. But if it just kind of stands there and is like, let's do it or whatever, [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=5321.32s)]
*  then I would say no. How would you feel if you had your girl? Oh, that's not fair. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrJMZ_js1oQ&t=5329.16s)]
