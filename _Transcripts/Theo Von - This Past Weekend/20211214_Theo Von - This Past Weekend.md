*  mind it was pretty like really it was a draw to be honest with you because [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=466.48s)]
*  EGA got dropped in the first round, but then I thought he won the last two rounds same [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=472.68s)]
*  So I honestly would give him a draw. Yeah, so when you um [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=476.96s)]
*  When you're watching guys like that fight does do you start to feel? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=482.12s)]
*  Cuz you've been out now for what a year now because your injury over. Yeah over a year about a year and probably what? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=485.4s)]
*  two months is it hard to still like [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=490.76s)]
*  See yourself as part of the show kind of you start to think like man [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=493.56s)]
*  I'm not does this you start to feel a little bit separate because you were on a kind of a roll there [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=497.91999999999996s)]
*  You know shoot. I wish I mean dude like [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=502.0s)]
*  It's it's intense in my head bro like I'm battling every day. I'm fighting somebody in my fucking head, bro [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=504.71999999999997s)]
*  I'm not gonna lie like I feel like I'm always on edge. I probably need to chill out [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=510.52s)]
*  So what so [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=517.36s)]
*  So let's talk about the rest of them that night that [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=519.76s)]
*  Those fights man first things first I got to say that I called the the pin you win [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=523.44s)]
*  Did you really and we have the first off I think you know I think she's pretty cute, so I'm gonna go for [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=528.8000000000001s)]
*  You know I like both of those chicks, so it was it wasn't because of the personalities or anything [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=536.4s)]
*  I picked pin you I picked pin you because she had beat I believe cats and Gano and cats and Gano [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=540.88s)]
*  And beat Amanda and she didn't it wasn't a fluke win when right when cats and Gano beat Amanda [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=547.48s)]
*  It was dominate domination of wrestling and superior ground work [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=552.4s)]
*  And so you get one ground fighter who's already beat this chick [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=555.92s)]
*  And then somebody comes and beats the chick who beat her right at what she beat her at ah [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=558.98s)]
*  And so in my head I'm thinking she's gonna get her to the ground and beat her gonna get her to ground and beat her [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=563.56s)]
*  And I didn't put no money on it though because I always fucking lose if I put money down [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=567.76s)]
*  I don't ever do it. I've only actually I never even put money down one time [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=571.56s)]
*  Yeah [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=575.54s)]
*  And then he's all stone and you're not [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=580.86s)]
*  When you lose a wee bet and your buddy just smokes it on you got to just sit there and look at his ass like he's [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=587.26s)]
*  Just been like he's just been eating ghosts bro my dude my buddy gets so fucked up when we're younger, bro [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=592.2199999999999s)]
*  Look he look like he'd eat a couple damn human this couple damn ghosts was in him, bro [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=597.66s)]
*  Fucking haunted dude, you got so high one time his fucking dad came to pick him up [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=602.1800000000001s)]
*  And he didn't even know his dad, bro, and he fucking fought him right there in the yard [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=606.4200000000001s)]
*  And he fought him bro like it was somebody coming to a kidnap him. I do that right now [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=611.62s)]
*  But do fighting your own dad just cuz you hire like are you so high you know I fight him cuz I'm pissed off [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=618.94s)]
*  I don't care if I'm high or what the fuck dude. I just beat his ass just for some child support [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=624.1s)]
*  Let's go son [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=629.18s)]
*  Yeah [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=630.42s)]
*  They should have if a dad flakes on the kid they should have at least a couple rounds [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=630.9s)]
*  Or when the child 16 or over that they got to do in the yard legally. Yeah, that's right [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=634.62s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. That should be part of the jurisdiction baby. Let's go dude [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=639.66s)]
*  We should we got to rewrite some of these laws man. Absolutely. They got some soft laws out there [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=643.42s)]
*  Let's go through the last minute this I'll say this man. So I'm sitting over there and [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=648.24s)]
*  man, uh [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=653.22s)]
*  Nunes just looked so much bigger [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=655.1s)]
*  Did it here's the thing though brother is like do no audio is it don't always [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=658.94s)]
*  Come to your favor when you're when you're bigger like that it means you cut more weight, and she's a power puncher right? [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=665.5s)]
*  So it's like okay, so you're talking about a power puncher who cuts a lot of weight [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=670.82s)]
*  Yeah, but she's gonna be great in the first round right she's a power puncher who cuts a lot of weight [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=674.5s)]
*  She's fighting somebody 10 15 pounds smaller, and she hits twice as hard now [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=678.86s)]
*  What do you think when they when you start to see this happening? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=682.58s)]
*  What would you have done different here if you're uh if you're Nunes? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=684.86s)]
*  Okay, I'm Nunes first off round one. That's where she made the mistake [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=689.22s)]
*  She she come out like she's gonna knock her out in the first round you throw in the power punches [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=693.58s)]
*  She should have barely won round one. I'm serious. I mean she should have gone out there saying I'm not gonna knock this girl out [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=697.88s)]
*  Yeah, I'm gonna barely win round one [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=703.5s)]
*  And then I'm gonna win round two a little bit better, and I'm gonna win round three a little bit [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=705.7s)]
*  But by round four or five I don't even give fuck already won the fight [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=709.94s)]
*  I'm just gonna do what I can do now. You know what I'm saying, but I think that she went in there [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=712.62s)]
*  She blasted all of her cannons right off the initial exchange because you so used to that you think [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=717.06s)]
*  Absolutely when it works so long you know I'm saying it's uh it works [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=723.0999999999999s)]
*  You know if I ain't broke don't fix it, but she ran into a different stylistic matchup. Here's the thing about when she fought Rousey [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=727.66s)]
*  Rousey's a great ground fighter in my opinion Rousey is probably the best woman ground fighter that there is out there [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=734.78s)]
*  Actually if Rousey and Pena get into an underground fight well first off that'd be sexy second off [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=742.86s)]
*  second off [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=749.46s)]
*  Second-right sitting in the front row cuz I want to spend some time [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=751.46s)]
*  Well second off I think that Rousey will probably win eventually because of the submissions [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=756.5s)]
*  I do not get pain yeah against pinion, but here's the thing [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=761.74s)]
*  Rousey could not get Amanda to the ground you know I'm saying um she has that straight-up [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=766.2600000000001s)]
*  Kind of grab them in clinch style [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=771.98s)]
*  Pena has a style where it's like shoot under and grab the legs [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=774.1s)]
*  Which works amazing if you're talking about a power puncher right because a power puncher when you swing you open up all the [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=776.9000000000001s)]
*  openings for that [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=784.22s)]
*  Like when a mother when I'm fighting a power puncher. I'm I'm not thinking I hope it don't swing hard [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=785.74s)]
*  I'm thinking I hope he swings as hard as he fucking can I'm a shoot and get them legs now if you're under Rousey [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=789.98s)]
*  You don't go for the legs. She don't do singles and doubles she has to go against her opponent in a straight line [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=795.1s)]
*  That's where she fucked up with Amanda Nunes bro. She tried to just close that distance without any type of [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=801.5400000000001s)]
*  Entangling of the hands no distractions. No nothing. She didn't reach the hands [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=807.7800000000001s)]
*  She just tried to go straight at her and there's like a train [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=811.74s)]
*  But if you would have seen Rousey get Amanda to the ground you probably would have seen even [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=814.9000000000001s)]
*  Even more disparity you know just like the disparity was on the feet it had been the same on the ground [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=819.86s)]
*  She just never had the [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=825.62s)]
*  She don't go for those legs [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=828.26s)]
*  You know and Amanda she opens up and throws those big punches when the legs are open [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=829.58s)]
*  And do you think that's kind of what she saw cuz we play that back again right opinion lured her into that's what opinion [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=833.58s)]
*  Did she she took some of her best shots lured her in? [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=838.74s)]
*  Landed just enough to piss her off and make her want to hit her more and nets when she got in on that takedown [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=842.14s)]
*  I'm pretty sure she shot a double leg. I can't remember though. Did she shoot a double? [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=848.26s)]
*  I mean she's staying in I could sworn she got her to the [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=852.42s)]
*  And you could tell her Nuna is like how is this not working and right? [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=855.72s)]
*  Then you just stayed right in there just take I mean you could say what is this hitting right right and you're absolutely right [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=861.8s)]
*  She just stayed right in there now. She's advancing forward right so now [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=869.64s)]
*  She's got a game plan on and gets her to the fence here comes a double if I'm her I'm shooting you'd already shot [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=873.12s)]
*  I might have but she was laying in there, too. I just I'm curious how she got her down [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=878.42s)]
*  I'm almost certain she got her legs. Oh, she tripped her okay there you go and [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=882.8s)]
*  And Nuna's is cooked here [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=888.04s)]
*  Yeah, but I think her it's ain't her game plan [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=890.16s)]
*  I mean think about probably been five years at least and she's been in that position in a fight, bro [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=892.56s)]
*  At least five years when she choked when it wasn't a choke right it was a neck [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=897.7199999999999s)]
*  What what what was the what it was go back that last few seconds there? [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=901.92s)]
*  It was probably a choke as well [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=906.5999999999999s)]
*  But if it wasn't on the throat you can still choke somebody right here on the face and the nose [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=908.96s)]
*  Yeah, what does she have or you can't really? [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=914.48s)]
*  Maybe she is under there [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=917.5600000000001s)]
*  Well it looked like she was up on her nose in her mouth [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=920.6s)]
*  But I don't and then look like she was on the neck to me either you know but I've got a little shock [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=923.24s)]
*  Yeah, I got a buddy back home [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=928.48s)]
*  He's actually a 25er, but there's something about the way that like you know how ants they can lift like ten times [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=930.2800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I never seen it, but they say it all the time. I guess there's videos of it probably yeah [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=936.48s)]
*  But little dudes are like that too like you get a little 125 or he can squeeze [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=941.0s)]
*  Oh, you're almost damn near as hard actually in certain positions a 125 or can squeeze just as hard as a 150 pounder [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=944.88s)]
*  Because I like the compactness of the muscles. I got a 125 pound buddy, bro. He does a face crush [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=950.96s)]
*  He don't even go for the neck he gets his arm and nose around your face in your mouth [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=956.64s)]
*  And bro yeah, you can't fucking breathe and it's actually let me tell you why it's worse than a rear-necked choke [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=960.92s)]
*  Because a rear-necked choke bro. You're kind of just gonna like um [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=965.92s)]
*  It's not the most pleasant choke because you actually can't breathe there's some chokes you can breathe [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=969.36s)]
*  Yeah, like an arm triangle rub and put the sleep in them bitches and one time [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=973.68s)]
*  I got put to sleep in like arm triangle, but I didn't even know [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=977.8s)]
*  I woke up. I thought I escaped [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=981.76s)]
*  Bro, did after the round the guy was like [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=984.32s)]
*  The guy was like bro. You were out. I was like no way [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=987.08s)]
*  I thought I got out of that he said not only were you out you were twitching for like 30 seconds [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=989.32s)]
*  I was like hey, man. I thought I was dizzy or something you know what he likes to dance, and that's subconscious baby [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=993.5400000000001s)]
*  Damn, but um you know that's a that's a pleasant choke you're cutting on both sides of the blood [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=998.2800000000001s)]
*  You could be in it and then just boom wake up and not even know you're out sometimes that rear-necked choke, bro [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1003.0400000000001s)]
*  You're gonna cut off your air supply you're breathing. I'll do it's it's miserable and so the one you talk about your buddy though [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1008.4000000000001s)]
*  What is that one like you can't breathe in so you're getting that effect of like you can't actually get it [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1014.6400000000001s)]
*  Air in like your own face or to any it it's over your face, and it crushes the fuck out of your draw [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1018.96s)]
*  It feels like your teeth are about to get just literally just fucking [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1024.68s)]
*  Just all you know jack so was that a new thing is like his own thing is like his own thing [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1028.4s)]
*  It's like you know, but you probably gotta have a wide. I mean you gotta have a wide [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1034.1000000000001s)]

*  Okay, we'll put it this way [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1045.5200000000002s)]
*  I'm better suited for twisters. Yeah, you know I got my bow legs and all that shit like I've got my things that I do [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1047.5600000000002s)]
*  You got your own things. Yeah, you can't do it all that ain't my fucking thing, bro. That is his thing [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1052.5600000000002s)]
*  Yeah, you might evolve in again and then doing something else is jerky fuckers. They can make lemonade, bro [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1057.0800000000002s)]
*  They can put them lemons right there and just squeeze that [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1062.16s)]
*  Old-fashioned that's that Russian. That's how the Russians do it when you look at them I [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1065.5200000000002s)]
*  Hope you like that stuff brother [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1070.9199999999998s)]
*  Do well I'll spice it up a little bit next time I'll do some chili pepper a little cumin [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1073.6s)]
*  You know the spice is a little bit low, but it's low. It's just good playing. You know I'm saying it's a very comfortable eat [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1078.56s)]
*  That's right. That's right. This is a comfortable eat, but I told the damn baby in your mouth sir [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1084.56s)]

*  That's that's a great fight [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1503.64s)]
*  It just it looked to me like Olivera had more weapons in his arsenal and that's what it came down to [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1506.56s)]
*  you know, um [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1514.2s)]
*  like [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1516.24s)]
*  Here was a telling sign for me to during a fight when Olivera got that first takedown [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1517.48s)]
*  Here's the difference okay. Mm-hmm Olivera gets dropped. What does DP do? [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1525.24s)]
*  Tries to knock him out. No, he lets him up didn't he? [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1530.4s)]
*  Let me think I swear he let him up [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1533.88s)]
*  Yeah, maybe let him up [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1537.8s)]
*  And and it's just like he is a lot better at the boxing but this is employees mind [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1539.84s)]
*  He's thinking I'm gonna knock this guy out with boxing [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1545.74s)]
*  In yeah, I think that's his that's his natural first thought it's his natural first start is I'm gonna let him up and box with [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1548.5s)]
*  Him and knock him out some more my drop him again now [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1554.98s)]
*  This is what coach Bryce says and coach Bryson shit on poy a poy a come over here and beat my ass right now [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1557.5s)]
*  And actually I want to train with you know [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1562.74s)]
*  I'm not I'm not saying but looking back at a fight you can look back at all my losses and say hey you shoulda [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1564.42s)]
*  Coulda and I'll say yeah, you're right. I should write [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1569.7s)]
*  It's easy for us to sit here and say is so fucking easy [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1571.82s)]
*  But if say we redo it and I'm wanting DP my dude to win right and I'm DP's coach and say if I say it [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1574.7s)]
*  He does it right. I say when you drop him get in his guard [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1581.2s)]
*  Grind out that first round maybe you're not gonna finish him probably unless you hurt him real bad because Charles got that guard [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1584.1399999999999s)]
*  But do not ever be scared to engage on the ground with an opponent [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1588.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that fear will manifest itself. I promise you and it's not saying he's not afraid of Charles Olivera's ground game [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1594.5s)]
*  That's not what I'm saying, but right. It's more like too much respect [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1601.46s)]
*  It's like bro your Dustin Poirier [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1604.3s)]
*  And he's fucking rocked you get on him and you just keep fucking just just whale down punches [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1606.46s)]
*  And if I was his coach I would tell him I don't give a fuck how good his guard is [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1611.32s)]
*  Yeah, you get in there and you fuck him up his guarding gonna be that good right you know I'm saying and so [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1614.7s)]
*  Yeah, I could see it being a level of like respecting it was it was a level of respect is all that [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1619.22s)]
*  Yeah, he just has this like [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1624.02s)]
*  There's a thick he has this these this mutual kind of thing yeah [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1626.98s)]
*  It's like I said he wanted to knock him out with the box yeah [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1630.58s)]
*  But if I was coach I'd be Dustin go in there getting his guard [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1633.18s)]
*  You know keep him down and just win the rest of that round conserve a little bit of your energy right [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1636.1399999999999s)]
*  Then the second round I believe that Olivera gets DP down, and this is what yeah [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1641.66s)]
*  That's when Olivera got him down and was throwing those elbows. They weren't landing like it didn't look super flush [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1646.74s)]
*  But some I'm sure they were they were [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1651.3s)]
*  So they hurt yeah, but when they hit you in the teeth you can feel it because they were laying right here and here [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1654.26s)]
*  And you know those elbows hurt you know [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1658.74s)]
*  But he had a body triangle [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1662.86s)]
*  Walked around his body and you can do that every now and then you know cuz to kind of recover or anything [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1665.06s)]
*  But I think he held that body triangle. He was actually holding himself in that position [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1670.86s)]
*  Oh, Dustin was the whole time damn right so it's having a gas [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1674.3s)]
*  No, well, that's what's kind of hold him trying to keep his body close to him [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1677.3799999999999s)]
*  I think so he didn't have that distance to [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1679.94s)]
*  Attack because he didn't want his back get taken and so and so I would tell him I'd say Dustin open that body trying [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1681.98s)]
*  You cannot how can you stand up on your feet if they're locked around your opponent? [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1689.3400000000001s)]
*  I say Dustin you've got to knock this guy out [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1693.78s)]
*  Or you got to at least bust them up you got to open your legs up [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1696.1000000000001s)]
*  And you got to fight to get up now the problem is if he opens his legs up [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1699.02s)]
*  Then what's possible putting his feet on the ground planting them and getting up getting back up now the risk [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1701.94s)]
*  There's that Olivera circles to his back or grabs a headlock, but here's the thing [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1706.24s)]
*  Would you rather? [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1711.1000000000001s)]
*  The dude choke you out with the rear naked choke or get you in a guillotine on the way up [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1712.74s)]
*  Or would you rather sit and lose that that that round by round by round with that body triangle? [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1717.82s)]
*  And you know I've done a lot of bad things in a fight, but I think when he looks back at it [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1723.3s)]
*  He'll say you know what I'm not gonna do that body triangle no more [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1727.8600000000001s)]
*  I'm gonna get back to my feet if my opponent gets me down because he was kind of keeping himself there in that position [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1731.42s)]
*  But it all came all those all those things you saw was the manifestation of the [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1736.5s)]
*  Over-respect that he gave to Olivera yeah, I say oh, it's one thing to say okay Olivera is good on the ground [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1743.0200000000002s)]
*  I don't want to go to the ground with him. It's another to say he's so good on the ground [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1749.0200000000002s)]
*  I'm not gonna open up my guard. I'm gonna hold him on top of me. No you can't be giving him that much respect fuck that [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1752.42s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's in his loves fighting so like the actual [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1757.8600000000001s)]
*  He likes it [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1760.66s)]
*  That's his thing so he's one of the best in the fucking world yeah [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1763.5800000000002s)]
*  Here's the thing you get a mat you get a matchup like [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1766.98s)]
*  So if I was good at it, I would do it if I'm you know if I'm good with a dagger [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1769.66s)]
*  I ain't gonna tickle somebody that's right. I want I'm saying so it's like just because it's like it's not the same thing [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1773.7s)]
*  Well, you know there's there's matchups like for Poirier that I just think he'll win every everyone [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1779.5400000000002s)]
*  I'm like the perfect matchup form. It's car McGregor [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1784.9s)]
*  Yeah, a guy who who power punches [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1788.02s)]
*  Doesn't do as good in the later rounds he does better in the first rounds whereas DP does better in the later rounds [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1792.22s)]
*  So you get a DP and a Connor McGregor matchup? [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1798.3799999999999s)]
*  There's not a time in the fight where Dustin has to worry about getting taken down getting choked [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1801.22s)]
*  No, he's in his element, and you're gonna see him fully unleashed, but you put him up against a Charles Rivera [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1806.06s)]
*  Olivera and [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1812.94s)]
*  You're gonna see in some positions more timidity because of that respect for the ground game [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1814.26s)]
*  And I don't and this is my honest assessment of Dustin's ground game [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1819.34s)]
*  I don't think the disparities as big as it is in his head right [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1823.14s)]
*  I think he was a little bit too worried about Olivera's ground game like I said when he dropped him. I'm pouncing [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1826.3799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1831.82s)]
*  I think I didn't talk to him enough about the actual fighting and stuff before about what his mindset was [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1832.82s)]
*  He's good on the ground man. I think he was just expecting that third round [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1838.3s)]
*  It would get back up to the feet the feet yeah, and and that's where it would kind of stay and so we'd have a you [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1841.86s)]
*  know and [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1847.86s)]
*  Then it just it just and I think also I think Dustin was most bummed [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1848.78s)]
*  What this this dog I say this my last loss guy took me down and I got choked out trying to get up [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1854.34s)]
*  You know Jane so I've been on the other end of it [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1860.1799999999998s)]
*  So it's just it you know it's easy to sit here and say oh you could have sure but my last fight, bro [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1862.5s)]
*  I wish that I would have got up safer [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1867.9399999999998s)]
*  If anything maybe I should have stayed on the ground the rest of the fight right I could have won a decision possibly but [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1871.1s)]
*  I learned a valuable lesson man, and there's every fight. There's something to learn yeah [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1877.22s)]
*  I mean look I obviously have you know like I get scared of things yeah [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1882.42s)]
*  I'm scared of something I does so I know nothing [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1887.7s)]
*  But it's like it's definitely just it's interesting to sit back and talk about it, and it's what we do as humans [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1890.18s)]
*  We see what happened and we look at it and and it's like I just know also Dustin was bummed probably he wanted to fight more [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1895.7s)]
*  That's the thing too, and I think it's the same with guys like you [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1902.74s)]
*  It's like you just want to fight more like we got five run [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1905.5800000000002s)]
*  Let's at least do four you know I'm saying like even if you already won. Let's do another you know like um [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1908.9s)]
*  Let's just keep it going [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1914.98s)]
*  Man the energy in there was so wild man [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1917.94s)]
*  And [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1920.26s)]
*  In gate she was back to gate. She's just back. She's literally like who can I fight who can I fight who can I fight? [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1922.26s)]
*  Ready to go. Oh, he's ready to go [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1928.82s)]
*  Let me tell you I think that um the gate. She's a great matchup for all of Arabic [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1932.34s)]
*  Yeah, what do you think what do you think would happen all of era gate? [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1936.58s)]
*  You cuz I feel like that's probably what's gonna be next. I don't think you're gonna see a [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1938.9s)]
*  Poirier all of era rematch cuz I think it makes so he could go make money fighting McGregor [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1942.46s)]
*  I think you know I might just get that that money fight or a Nate Diaz fight [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1947.3799999999999s)]
*  They would pay him so much money for that Nate Diaz fight to punch. He's in a position, bro [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1951.86s)]
*  He don't even have to worry about fighting for the belt. He's a fucking bajillionaire or whatever he is you know I'm saying like yeah [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1956.18s)]
*  He's made him some money, and it's not gonna be typical with him. He's gonna do something crazy [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1961.86s)]
*  I bet you you know so what does the belt mean to people cuz Dustin was an interim champion, so that is it [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1965.8999999999999s)]
*  That's a champion. You know it's um especially with the way the belt is kind of used as like a [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1970.74s)]
*  It's a bait they use it sometimes. It's who's definitely obviously it's always who's great [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1977.06s)]
*  Yeah, but sometimes it's used by the administration over there [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1982.6599999999999s)]
*  It seems like it is like a well [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1986.34s)]
*  You know everybody's path is different [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1987.78s)]
*  And I don't think that these people who have the belts are fucking built different than any book [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1989.74s)]
*  You know they had good [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1994.58s)]
*  Circumstances and yeah, and and a lot of them are great and everything and and are elite and stuff [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=1996.1399999999999s)]
*  I put it this way man if I'm in a fucking street fight, and I'm fighting for my life [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2002.12s)]
*  And and there's one person I have my back and and they said it's Dustin Poirier. Yeah, I'm thinking fuck [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2007.12s)]
*  Yeah, I don't give a fuck what belt he's got this or that Dustin Poirier can fight anybody [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2012.6s)]
*  Yeah, I don't care if he's wearing it. I don't give a fuck who it is [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2017.64s)]
*  I don't care if he's wearing a belt from Banana Republic [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2020.72s)]
*  That's right. I want DP having my back. You know what I'm saying and [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2022.72s)]
*  You know here's another thing man with that that championship stuff man, it's like I [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2027.64s)]
*  Hate to see these people get the belt, and then they act like they're gods or something. You know what I mean like it's um [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2033.04s)]
*  Okay, McGregor double champ right yeah, okay, DP ain't a fucking double champ, okay? [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2039.36s)]
*  Who wins when they fight right you know you know who we're right so it's interesting [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2044.64s)]
*  It's interesting what it ain't all about that right and people's paths are different [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2048.96s)]
*  He has a lot of fights he had some rough nights, and you know it [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2053.56s)]
*  He's a championship fighter. I don't give a fuck if he has a belt or not like I said [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2058.24s)]
*  I'm comfortable with him having my back in any street fight. Amen man [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2061.68s)]
*  Yeah, I uh it's definitely interesting. It's interesting to see different guys pass now Dustin has made obviously [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2065.3199999999997s)]
*  He said he's had some choices and made some choices and had some [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2070.96s)]
*  Blessings where he's gotten to have a stronger financial side than probably a lot of fighters have that's right [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2075.04s)]
*  And do you think [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2081.18s)]
*  How does that start to influence other fighters to do their own things? [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2083.5s)]
*  I know you got your you got your music now that you got you know which is cool, man [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2086.8599999999997s)]

*  The first one the first song on there [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2193.08s)]
*  I made about a year and a half maybe two years ago [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2195.2000000000003s)]
*  and then I wasn't really focused on it, and then I made another song and another one and [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2197.1200000000003s)]
*  Each song probably took a couple weeks to write except the first one first one took like two days [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2202.1200000000003s)]
*  And then I would just kind of casually work on other ones it wasn't like [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2208.04s)]
*  Until about the last month, then I was like really like okay. I really want to put this shit out there [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2213.08s)]
*  I got about six songs. I'm gonna finish this seventh one [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2217.1200000000003s)]

*  I need to finish this I need to wrap it up [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2222.68s)]
*  And I got that feeling but while I was making most of the songs I didn't have any type of timeline [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2224.36s)]
*  I was just having fun with it. Yeah, wow [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2228.4s)]
*  Yeah, that's gotta be nice thing so it didn't really it was just kind of a passion project [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2231.6s)]
*  It wasn't like a absolute 100% passion, and it wasn't something you're just waking up and doing like I gotta [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2235.0s)]
*  Get lying gonna make no money, bro. I'm fucking using YouTube beats, and yeah, I'm saying like right [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2240.48s)]
*  Yeah, and it's it's more it's more about the money [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2245.72s)]
*  And it's about the greatest thing that I could do is to relate to people that watch my fights [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2248.7599999999998s)]
*  That you know just to relate to people if there's somebody out there that that heard even if it's one fucking verse [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2254.2s)]
*  And they heard it and they thought shoot. I'm going through that too. You know and it's like okay [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2260.24s)]

*  Why yeah cuz the music always connects people the same as with the yeah, you hear somebody [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2276.66s)]
*  It's like Eminem you hear something you're like damn. That's my fucking that's one of my favorites right there Eminem [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2280.4599999999996s)]

*  Do you feel like you need to do stuff to try and keep your name out to deep? [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2291.18s)]
*  What did you start to ever feel like that a little bit because it's it's tough because it's like you [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2296.18s)]
*  You don't disappear you're there [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2301.1200000000003s)]
*  You know you have a great rank in your top 15th or 10 or 11 and some of the rankings or what you know [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2303.32s)]
*  Whatever the rankings are kind of [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2308.44s)]
*  But that you can't get out there and express yourself you you know you're like you're expressing is limited [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2311.8s)]
*  Yes, because you can't get in there. That's what I feel fighting is and same with the music and [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2316.84s)]
*  You know the feeling of people [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2322.1200000000003s)]
*  Forgetting about me or whatever it is true [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2324.6000000000004s)]
*  Everybody if you stop fighting people forget about you, but that ain't why I fight right it is this inner desire to express [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2327.0s)]
*  Most of us fucking anger frustration. Yeah, you know and it's and it's um it's more about [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2335.44s)]
*  All I care that is that God's watching me [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2341.4s)]
*  Yeah, you know what I'm saying like that [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2343.44s)]
*  I have a purpose that I'm fighting for something [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2345.16s)]
*  And I don't give a fuck who's watching if I feel like God has told me to go in there and fight to better my life [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2347.24s)]
*  To better potentially better my family's life. That's what I'm doing it for it's not for any type of attention [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2352.56s)]
*  I did not put the mixtape out for attention. I put it out [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2357.88s)]
*  Like say I put it out an honest anonymously people didn't even know it was mine [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2362.2799999999997s)]
*  I wouldn't even I wouldn't give a fuck as long as people liked it [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2366.72s)]
*  You know I just want people to relate to it and feel good [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2369.48s)]
*  It's just expression and bro. I ain't made no fucking money off that I put hundreds and hundreds of dollars into it [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2371.6s)]
*  You know I'm saying like it ain't about it writing about that [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2377.04s)]
*  It was about letting that shit out of me [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2380.24s)]
*  Yeah [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2382.4399999999996s)]
*  And you know it's been built up for a long time and like when I'm when I'm fighting or whatever man you get these emotions [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2382.9199999999996s)]
*  It's just like the closest thing you could feel like God [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2389.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I'm saying like I'll be fighting sometimes and I'll just like make myself or I'll be rapping sometimes and I'll make myself laugh [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2393.0s)]
*  I'll make myself cry [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2399.3599999999997s)]
*  I'll get mad at some shit that I say like I'll be in the middle of a rap [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2400.7999999999997s)]
*  Freestyle and in the car or something and so fuck you know it makes me so mad just thinking of that memory [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2404.3999999999996s)]
*  And I'm like hitting the steering wheel and shit, and then I'm like okay. I just snapped out of it [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2409.86s)]
*  That's not I'm not doing that for money right right saying that's like I'm letting this shit out. Yeah [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2414.78s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's one of the things even just like you know [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2420.9s)]
*  Dustin's probably the fighter that I know the kind of the closest so it's been interesting to just I can understand exactly what you're saying like [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2423.6200000000003s)]
*  If you look at his early stuff. It's like it's just this anger. It's this angry guy fighting [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2430.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, and then you see as you as he starts to get older and evolve that you get to know [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2436.22s)]
*  He gets to express himself in other ways [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2442.7799999999997s)]
*  It's like you almost got to fucking get these layers of anger out of you [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2445.2599999999998s)]
*  So you can get to the stuff that's different so you can have opportunities to like get your voice out there [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2449.98s)]
*  It's like I hope my anger goes away one of these days [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2456.2599999999998s)]
*  But not before you have a few more good bouts out there [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2460.54s)]

*  Because so many of the fighters to me or hero, that's what I realized when I'm there the other night [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2823.0s)]
*  I'm like oh my god everybody I run into I feel like is a hero your heroes die in the sport man [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2826.7599999999998s)]

*  And you see so much evidence that it's gonna be like this and it could be anything [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=2864.4s)]

*  Right. It could be his game. That could be his game. That's right. So but here's here's how I handle that [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=3225.7s)]
*  Okay, there might be a chance in that fight where you've already knocked him out or whatever [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=3230.94s)]
*  He's sitting there laying down her beans halfway across off the guy [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=3235.58s)]
*  You get that extra second and if that motherfucker called me a bitch. Yeah. Well, we're gonna see if I hit like a bitch [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=3238.8999999999996s)]
*  before before herb gets there [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=3245.94s)]
*  That's all I gotta say free herb baby, that's right [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=3249.2999999999997s)]

*  He don't like all the motherfuckers. He might just let him get an extra one. I bet there is a time [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=3259.74s)]
*  I mean not on her but on any referee of anything because I remember I even used to referee flag football [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=3264.4599999999996s)]
*  Did I used to work at like the student center or whatever in school? [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=3269.62s)]

*  I'm not gonna go watch the whole fight [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=3300.74s)]
*  But there was that one punch that Woodley landed and that's honestly all I saw of it [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=3302.3s)]

*  Oh, wow, so we didn't actually have any expenses this year. So that's fucking good. That's even man. That's even [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=3783.1s)]

*  So and how many and how many cows did the cows have every year? I think it's kind of like a [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=3797.7200000000003s)]
*  similar to a human like the the length of time it takes, you know, so [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=3805.12s)]

*  I hope it's true. Hook him to the bone [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=4038.84s)]
*  Also, would you consider anybody from the UFC hopping on a track with you someday? [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=4041.56s)]

*  Talking UFC [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=4067.52s)]
*  Shoot Roy Nelson [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=4070.2000000000003s)]
*  Right around Roy Nelson [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=4075.1600000000003s)]
*  My hard hitter. Yeah, I song be called biscuits and gravy. Oh, yeah, dude [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=4077.7200000000003s)]
*  biscuits [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=4083.52s)]
*  I don't want to be the biscuit [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=4086.6400000000003s)]
*  He's gravy dog for sure. Oh [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=4089.44s)]
*  Bro, that would be so sick, man. Yeah [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=4092.7200000000003s)]
*  Maybe a door there you and Derek Lewis. That's right [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=4095.92s)]
*  That would be fire and that could be biscuits and gravy too man. Oh, yeah, brother or biscuits and syrup maybe [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=4100.12s)]
*  biscuits and gravy [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=4107.72s)]
*  Yeah, Roy Nelson. He said he didn't fought in years, huh? [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=4109.68s)]
*  He retired. I think he went to Bellatoria. He might have retired. Yeah [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=4112.8s)]
*  What do you see happening next in the in the lightweight division kind of like this 55? [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=4116.88s)]
*  Probably [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=4124.16s)]
*  Think a she could be Olivera. Yeah [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=4125.759999999999s)]
*  Well now we but we gave you gaetji is a palming. He's a he's just him him and Dustin [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=4129.08s)]
*  That's why their fights is he loved to punch. Mm-hmm. He rated upon he would write it upon [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=4133.759999999999s)]
*  He literally would have not me I just like it's almost like something he'll do for you if that's nice like hey [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=4138.12s)]
*  Like it's just it's like a way to show express anything, you know [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=4145.4s)]
*  Kind of I think that it would be really hard for Olivera to get Gaetji down to the ground [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=4149.4s)]
*  And I think it would be but do you why would why would it be any harder to get him down than Dustin down? [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=4153.8s)]
*  You feel like that wrestling? Yeah that wrestling and and Dustin's done [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=4158.84s)]
*  So much grappling in his life that he's been on the ground like he's not gonna have that response [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=4162.62s)]
*  That Gaetji is gonna have like there's a there's a certain point in which you're somebody's in on a takedown and [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=4168.98s)]
*  You have to expend and you know, okay [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=4174.62s)]
*  They might get this takedown and they might not but if I if I don't want them to [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=4176.58s)]
*  I'm gonna have to expend a lot of energy [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=4180.54s)]
*  You know I'm saying and I feel like Gaetji [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=4182.82s)]
*  He's a type of person like I'll give everything I fucking got to stop this takedown. I won't let you where's Dustin [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=4184.82s)]
*  Might let him have it to the forgetting I think doesn't go for getting I don't think you'll see ever Justin Gaetji go for [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=4191.5s)]
*  Gating but Dustin Poirier is more comfortable like if it fight goes to ground he's not in trouble [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=4196.839999999999s)]
*  You know I'm saying like DP can fight good on the ground [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=4201.379999999999s)]
*  But would it be easy for Barbosa would it be easy for Olivera to get Gaetji on the ground? [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=4204.5s)]
*  You're saying that that would be the harder step to get him. It would be a stand-up fight [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=4209.179999999999s)]
*  It wouldn't it wouldn't go to the ground [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=4212.48s)]
*  And then wonder what happens with Chandler in that division [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=4216.299999999999s)]
*  Because you got that kids Matt Mike I'm not sure cause much of my yeah, no he's a he's a [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=4220.56s)]
*  He's 85 he's 85 or I believe or no I'm sorry he's 170 no he is he yeah [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=4231.72s)]
*  He said bring up the lightweight UFC lightweight top 20 rankings if you can [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=4237.9800000000005s)]
*  But he actually had a grappling match with the hundred eighty five pound guy and beat him at grappling [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=4242.320000000001s)]
*  You know so he could actually get in there and hang with us the Islam guy right oh [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=4247.22s)]
*  Islam okay, Islam [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=4252.62s)]
*  He's 155 isn't he yeah, I think he could be coming up there that dude's coming. I mean he's one [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=4255.18s)]
*  Yeah, I think he's undefeated in our me my I think I've seen a video him getting knocked out [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=4262.66s)]
*  Yeah, baby. I think now the video also could have been some dude like [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=4267.9400000000005s)]
*  Photoshopping it or whatever you know like chopping it up, but I did see a video of him getting knocked out like I said [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=4272.34s)]
*  Could have been a fake video though. I didn't keep up and scroll down some let's scroll down some there [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=4277.38s)]
*  He is right there number four in this rankings does he have any losses next to his name? He's 21 and one okay? [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=4282.1s)]
*  That was the one that I saw my overall so 10 and one it looks like in the in the UFC [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=4288.02s)]
*  And then I saw that one where he lost but bro, so I mean who's he fighting that so you got? [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=4291.860000000001s)]
*  So Dustin would probably have to maybe fight that guy would because and that guy is a pure rat. He's like a Khabib style [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=4298.5s)]

*  Yeah [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=4994.780000000001s)]
*  so we were living at um [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=4995.22s)]
*  Ally Quinn's house and there were six six fighters in the house and there's just a hell of a good time [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=4996.780000000001s)]
*  So I so anyway, I was backstage and that's when the Cody fight was going on right and we're watching it [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5002.3s)]
*  And he said that when you drop down a weight class like there's less likes [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5007.18s)]
*  Your body's so tight that when you get knocked out at a lower weight [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5012.1s)]
*  it's real hard on your system because you just [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5015.860000000001s)]
*  You know, there's less like fat inside is less like cushion inside of your side of your universe, you know [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5019.26s)]
*  particularly from your brain [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5025.42s)]
*  Yeah, because think about this your body knows how important your brain is when you get to that final moment in the weight cut when you're [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5027.58s)]
*  Like okay. I can't cut no more. That's when your body begins to pull the moisture from the brain [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5033.7s)]
*  It's the last thing that your body will protect that your body will keep all that fluid in your brain until it don't have [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5040.58s)]
*  Fluid from nowhere else and then your head your brain fluid now guess which guess which fluid takes some of the longest to get back [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5048.26s)]
*  Into your system brain that brain fluid now. Here's how I knew [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5054.9400000000005s)]
*  That the Cody was really feeling I didn't think he was gonna lose I didn't know that's not what I'm saying [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5059.780000000001s)]
*  But here's how I knew he was feeling he ain't a fucking 25er. He ain't a 25er. I promise bro [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5066.46s)]
*  He might do good at 25 [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5072.38s)]
*  He's really a 35 or though because he just he's healthier 35 but here's how I knew [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5074.54s)]
*  Because I saw him do a video Garbrandt and he was talking and I could tell his voice was not [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5079.900000000001s)]
*  The same it was when you begin cutting that much weight [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5088.18s)]
*  I have sinus issues or you get just extremely [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5091.34s)]
*  Dehydrated in a when you get to that point of extreme dehydration, you'll notice a lot of fluid change up here [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5094.82s)]
*  I actually cannot hear I'm not kidding you Wow, like there'd be you ever get water stuck in your ear at the pool [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5101.2s)]
*  Yeah, bro [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5107.24s)]
*  I've been cutting weight before and it's like waters in both my ears and I heard him do this interview and [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5108.2s)]
*  Okay, so this is my normal voice [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5115.2s)]
*  I'm kind of talking I kind of heard him like kind of like a like his [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5116.5199999999995s)]
*  It was a different pitch and I could tell something was up in the up in the navel just so dried out, bro [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5120.12s)]
*  I was like always dry and I could see in his cheeks. I knew it brother [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5126.0199999999995s)]
*  I knew that is a tough weight cut and [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5129.78s)]
*  and I think that his performance was probably hindered by the weight cut and I think that he's a 35 er and [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5132.0199999999995s)]
*  Break, but I'm just telling you by the way he was talking I could feel it [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5138.3s)]
*  I could feel it in my nose and my ears [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5142.38s)]
*  He was having sinus issues bro [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5144.099999999999s)]
*  Because when you start your your flu is drained and then your your brain flu is drained and then you got this pressure [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5145.82s)]
*  You can't hear right you can't smell and how can you fight like that? You can't not the same? [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5150.86s)]
*  You know I'm saying he didn't I [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5156.46s)]
*  Didn't actually see the whole fight. I just saw highlights of it, but brother. He's fast. Yeah, and he didn't look as fast out there. Yeah [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5159.02s)]
*  Yeah, I can't I can't even imagine the levels that your body has to go to to do all of that [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5166.34s)]
*  I think that that that was just a big weight cut on him [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5170.94s)]
*  That's what I think you saw that performance out of him for and like I said I didn't even see the fight [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5174.32s)]
*  I just saw highlights of it and like you said man [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5178.34s)]

*  I'm saying [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5372.919999999999s)]
*  Price Mitchell they call me the price is right Mitchell, bro. That would be a good store the price is right [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5374.44s)]
*  I [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5381.32s)]
*  Know you'd be so much better than Bob Barker on that show [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5382.96s)]
*  If there's ever a price is right you're the motherfucking house be giving away damn [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5386.32s)]
*  I will meet on that bitch show winning last episode you'd be giving away everything [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5390.32s)]
*  That's right, okay, we got to get rid of some of these [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5397.84s)]
*  So that the IDI engine it's different in these modern power strokes power stroke is they're both great engines of Ford engines [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5401.32s)]
*  But this IDI is mechanical in nature, so it doesn't have as much computer [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5409.6s)]
*  Parts and so that's what I love about it [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5416.0s)]
*  I fucking cannot stand all this cheap electronic shit, and let me tell you it's [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5418.92s)]
*  It ruins everything and it is to the level where it is a conspiracy [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5424.56s)]
*  If you don't think that they're making these cars to break at a certain point or making it more expensive for certain parts [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5427.84s)]
*  You're fucking blind, bro [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5434.320000000001s)]
*  Because that's what the industry the cars from the 90s with the manual transmissions and the simple engines last longer and are easier to fix [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5435.44s)]
*  Than these newer ones they're doing that because they want you in the dealership [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5442.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and they don't like I got the best mechanic in the fucking world that lives like right down the road for me [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5445.84s)]
*  His name is Paul Underwood and let me tell you what I guarantee you. Mr [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5452.28s)]
*  Paul could fix anything on that 7.3. IDI right you know and he could probably fix a power stroke too [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5456.96s)]
*  But there's gonna be some computer. Yeah something you can't that's out of your control [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5463.16s)]
*  But it's just like okay [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5467.72s)]
*  You're gonna have to order this cheap ass part from some just to get the shit to work [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5469.0s)]
*  Yeah, and by now they know how long you're gonna use a car. It's just so many things [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5472.88s)]
*  No, it's a conspiracy bro. It like it's it's called if you want to look into it. It's called planned obsolescence [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5477.44s)]
*  It's been going on really since the beginning of time [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5483.2s)]
*  It's not a conspiracy bro like when it first started getting popular. There's one instance of it in Germany [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5485.4s)]
*  There was a people who made t-shirts I believe maybe t-shirts or jeans, but they started using nylon well, bro [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5490.44s)]
*  Nobody they didn't have any return customers because the fucking t-shirts and jeans was lasting damn forever [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5497.759999999999s)]
*  It's like they sell a pair of jeans, and you never see that motherfucker again, so they had to start making shitty jeans [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5503.639999999999s)]
*  But bro, that's in every single [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5508.28s)]
*  Industry that there is and it's to certain degrees, but in the car industry you see so much planned obsolescence these pieces of shit [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5511.919999999999s)]
*  especially Nissan's [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5518.299999999999s)]
*  With the CVT transmissions, you know cuz I have one going on me son damn, but um I wouldn't even come [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5520.44s)]
*  Here's it exactly well I beg to differ on that one [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5527.12s)]
*  That's the one complaint I don't get [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5535.48s)]
*  But let me tell you what them headlights for example you get you one of these Nissan [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5538.759999999999s)]
*  2006 [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5543.44s)]
*  Maximus this is a planned obsolescence that I'm talking about to certain degrees [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5545.16s)]
*  Okay, you fix you break your headlight guess how much that fucking new one costs probably 250 150 yeah damn [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5548.58s)]
*  Bro, it's a fucking headlight. They can make that for three dollars [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5555.54s)]
*  Yeah, you know I'm saying so they got you and they do that with their transmissions [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5558.62s)]
*  They do with their engine not this Ford engine not this 7.3. IDI [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5562.219999999999s)]
*  It's a real engine made for real farmers who really work for their real money [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5565.2s)]
*  Yeah, and don't want to spend it on no fake shit. You know and that truck is is me [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5568.86s)]
*  personified and the only thing I got to do is got to add a little one of those [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5573.379999999999s)]
*  Gooseneck balls on the back of it. You know that mounts right there in a truck bed [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5578.5599999999995s)]
*  Oh for a for pulling a heavyweight from cattle. Oh really and hey [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5581.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so what you look it's for it is for the transmission now [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5587.78s)]
*  well [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5591.32s)]
*  it's it's [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5591.799999999999s)]
*  so you can actually pull that weight if you you know the [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5592.9s)]
*  The balls that hang off the back like a regular like on it. You'll see it there in that truck [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5596.0199999999995s)]
*  You see I got a little two-inch ball [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5600.139999999999s)]
*  I got a three-way right on the back of it not the kind you like but yeah the kind with you know [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5601.48s)]
*  The kind with three different hitches on it. Yeah, yeah, yeah that sticks off the back of the truck, okay? [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5607.78s)]
*  Okay, when you mount one of these goose neck or fifth wheel [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5613.379999999999s)]
*  Hitches you got to do it from the inside from the truck bed [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5617.58s)]
*  Oh, and so that distributes to where all that weight ain't on them [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5620.16s)]
*  It puts more of it up front so your truck and more of the weight goes to the trailer and so now you can pull [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5623.82s)]
*  32,000 pounds bro like I'm gonna be pulling some shit. You know oh, yeah, so I gotta get that [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5630.0199999999995s)]
*  I gotta fix my brake lights [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5635.68s)]
*  I gotta rig it up to where I'm not jumping a solenoid every time I start it [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5637.200000000001s)]
*  It's got a little bit of ash on the seats. I can tell this dude [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5641.52s)]
*  He had a swisher when I pull out the little cup holder thing he had a swisher in it [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5644.280000000001s)]
*  I'm like Brian even tripping. I just wish I was here for that one. You know [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5648.52s)]
*  But bro, it's so cool like it's an old-school manual and by the way you don't ever see these manuals [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5652.72s)]
*  That's how you know they're trying to make these vehicles to break now [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5657.72s)]
*  You can't even hardly find a fucking truck with me. I would never I would never buy another vehicle [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5660.34s)]
*  It's not a manual unless if something crazy happens, and I get some good deal or something [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5664.48s)]
*  You know but you know this thing is like you put it in the first row [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5668.2s)]
*  And like you don't even have just let off the clutch man like it's gonna go. It's not gonna die [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5671.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you know it's got so much power like I'm not even touching the gas you just put it in first [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5675.759999999999s)]
*  No, and I think it just creeps [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5680.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, it is nice power into something that feels like it has a life of its own bro [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5681.759999999999s)]
*  It does man got two gas tanks on it you switch it, but one of them don't read [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5686.919999999999s)]
*  So you just kind of like have to you are the gas [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5690.759999999999s)]

*  Dude that's awesome man [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5707.28s)]
*  Damn yeah, you can pull a lot of weight with that man. That's right [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5710.759999999999s)]
*  32,000 pounds is what it's rated for of course. I don't even have a gooseneck trailer actually [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5714.759999999999s)]
*  That's the next thing that I got to get is a gooseneck trailer to pulling that shit because I've got light duty trailers right now [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5719.0s)]
*  I could pull about [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5724.38s)]
*  Most I put on in about six thousand pounds on one and I tell you what I put six thousand pounds on a trailer [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5725.7s)]
*  The other day I bought for that block wall that I'm building. Yeah [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5730.88s)]

*  It's not a sharp curve, but that curve was enough to start a fishtail bro and [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5758.02s)]
*  Jesus take the wheel there's nobody coming or nothing, bro [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5763.26s)]
*  But hey, I think a good thing for me to maybe the reason that this popped in my head [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5767.06s)]
*  Maybe God's trying to save somebody's life [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5772.46s)]
*  Let me tell you right now do not touch the brakes if you get into that fishtail you see I'm saying yeah [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5774.02s)]

*  Well, that was a buck. Yeah, that's that's a different story right there, but here's what I'd have done out of [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5911.68s)]
*  Out of uh you know locked out my arms, huh now I got a little knee on the ribs arms locked out now [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5916.0s)]
*  He's awake. Yeah [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5922.8s)]
*  And then I'm just gonna brainstorm for a minute. I'm [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5924.84s)]
*  I'll be honest with you. I ain't been there today. I ain't been in that one yet [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5928.400000000001s)]
*  I'm gonna lock him out, and I'm gonna brainstorm for me [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5931.92s)]
*  Bro that fucking uh let me tell you what that rear naked is gonna be hard with them antlers in the way [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5935.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you might have to pull triangle. Yeah, you know I'm saying like it's gonna get desperate [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5940.64s)]
*  Yeah, actually trying to leash you to have more control you probably able to keep him upright enough to keep that I keep [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5945.92s)]
*  The antlers away from you if you want me real fucked up, and you can talk about some animal cruelty [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5950.74s)]
*  Go for arm bar [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5956.8s)]
*  Well then then you won because even if yeah, he ain't going nowhere [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5959.679999999999s)]
*  Like if them antlers are in the way bro go pull arm bar like I said [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5963.92s)]
*  I'm all about position staying on top [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5967.82s)]
*  But if you can't sink in that choke and that deer is getting up and you see a arm go for that arm bar brother [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5970.0s)]
*  That's what I'm saying bro like he ain't gonna you know he ain't got no defense [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5977.8s)]
*  You know the best defense is hold your hands together. Yeah, what's he gonna do? Yeah? [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5981.8s)]
*  Damn, that's a risky move. Here's a second one. We got three of them for you. Here's a second one now this lady got [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5986.68s)]

*  So that lady got she got uh [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5995.0s)]
*  That lady got took it took that it's a looks like a doe or just a female [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=5998.84s)]
*  Oh, yeah, she just she took his back and got him down see what you see here is perfect [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=6003.64s)]
*  We got situational awareness. I promise you this ain't her first go around [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=6009.04s)]
*  Yeah, you see that then hips on that she's putting them hips on that deer's hips. She's got her hips on that [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=6012.72s)]
*  Deer's hips she's keeping that low center base knee spread out [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=6019.04s)]
*  Well, I can tell you right now this ain't her first first rodeo [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=6024.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, this ain't the first deer at the Walmart for this lady. No, and she's holding that arm [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=6028.6s)]
*  She's got that arm lock too if you see up by that she's got she's keeping that arm that deer from getting any [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=6033.0s)]
*  I'm not even gonna comment on this because she's doing far better than I would have you know [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=6039.0s)]
*  I'm saying like she that's a cleanup on aisle three. She's gonna take it out [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=6043.0s)]
*  She's already cleaned up. Let's get that third one the last one we got here. She's perfect technique [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=6048.96s)]
*  And this one we can have some audio on oh, no. Yeah, this was fine [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=6054.24s)]
*  And how do you handle this situation [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=6060.56s)]
*  You're obviously some uppers oh, yeah [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=6068.8s)]
*  Well right there, I don't see anybody trying to cut off the the room, you know I'm saying I see that guy [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=6073.84s)]
*  First off he gets up out of the chair and he's not in his stance. That's where he fucked up first [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=6079.08s)]
*  Yeah, that's the first thing I do because you know, there ain't no bad door ain't he ain't gonna go out the back door [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=6082.4800000000005s)]
*  You know first thing I'm doing see he's right out the front door [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=6087.4s)]

*  I think that guy didn't want the smoke he kind of what he like kind of wandered over there [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVG-sLMunJE&t=6132.76s)]
