Video Description: Recently retired Border Patrol Chief Chris Clem served 27 ½  years in El Paso, Texas, and more recently, Yuma, Arizona. Since retiring from his position, he has worked in the private sector combating human trafficking and other online and social exploitation.


Theo is joined by a former Border Patrol Chief to talk about what’s really been going on at the U.S. / Mexico border. They talk about the history that led up to our current situation, the difference between immigration policy and border security, how the Cartel exploits migrants for money, the politicization of the border from both sides, and what needs to be done to fix it.

*  most recently in Yuma, Arizona and El Paso, Texas. And he really got a firsthand look at what's going [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=40.239999999999995s)]
*  on with America's border. That's what we want to talk about and we will and a lot more. Today's [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=47.28s)]
*  guest is Border Patrol chief Chris Flim. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=54.32s)]
*  The funny thing is I run into my friend yesterday. He's a chef and he's like, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=85.19999999999999s)]
*  dude, I think your guests are staying at our hotel. And I was like, really? That's awesome. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=92.24s)]
*  Yeah, it was. I've even been there yet. Yeah, it's a nice hotel. You know how really small of a world [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=96.96s)]
*  this is. So I'm flying up here, direct from Phoenix to Nashville. And we're talking with [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=104.0s)]
*  Chris Clim here today, 27 and a half years as a Border Patrol agent. Yes, yes. Now I'm glad to [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=109.44s)]
*  be here. I was just, you know, saying I flew in from Phoenix last night and the lady sitting next [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=116.24s)]
*  to me was staying at the same hotel. She'd never been in Nashville. It's been six years since I've [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=121.28s)]
*  been in Nashville and she's asking if anything, you know, what are you, what are you going to do? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=124.32s)]
*  I said, well, I got some business I'm dealing with. She was like, you know, where are you staying? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=129.12s)]
*  I said, well, I'm staying at this hotel. She was like, that's where we're staying. It was, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=132.56s)]
*  there's a whole party of people that she was with. There's like one of their girlfriends [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=135.2s)]
*  having a birthday party. And so they all came up here. I'm yeah. I'm like, well, I'm avoiding [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=138.56s)]
*  that crowd tonight, but it was a great place last night. Very comfortable and a super, super nice [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=142.96s)]
*  hotel. Yeah. Yeah. Thanks for coming in, man. And yeah, thanks for making the effort. Really [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=149.04s)]
*  appreciate it. You know, you just always hear so much stuff like about the border, you know, it's [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=153.76s)]
*  like the border and immigration and like the effects of it. And I'm always just curious about [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=158.08s)]
*  what's going on, you know, like what's the truth? What's the reality? So you're recently retired [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=163.44000000000003s)]
*  from your work as a border agent. Yes. And where did you finish up at? I was the chief patrol agent [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=168.96s)]
*  in Yuma, Arizona, which was pretty much ground zero in 21 and 22 for the immigration and border [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=176.24s)]
*  security crisis we've been dealing with. Yeah. And when you say like, well, like what is our current [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=182.96s)]
*  immigration policy? Yeah. So a couple of things we want to talk about, right? So [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=189.44s)]
*  immigration and border security are actually two separate, you know, they're not, they're closely [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=194.72s)]
*  related, but this is where the problem comes in. We conflate immigration and border security and [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=201.04s)]
*  we really need to kind of separate those. So I'll talk like my expertise, my wheelhouse is border [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=206.0s)]
*  security. Immigration is a long standing process that's going on and going on in this country for [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=211.84s)]
*  hundreds of years, right? You have visas, you have people that come in, you know, through the ports [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=218.88s)]
*  of entry, they apply on the front end. So there's that immigration process. You have non-immigrants [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=223.68s)]
*  and you have immigrants, intended immigrants, you have residents. It's a, it's very, very convoluted, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=228.16s)]
*  but what happens is so many people are coming in illegally and we don't have the right fix [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=233.68s)]
*  for that mass of humanity. I mean, the laws and the books do it, but when you're dealing with [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=241.68s)]
*  volumes and volumes of people, it's very challenging. So what I'd like to do is, is what I do is talk [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=246.32s)]
*  strictly about more of the border security piece. Okay. But, but, but it's not lost that you have to [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=252.24s)]
*  have the right mix because we have proven through history, go back 50, 60 years with good lawful [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=258.56s)]
*  programs in place. The bracero program is a prime example where they brought in guest workers, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=267.68s)]
*  specifically to work in the fields. The bracero program? Bracero program. Yes. That actually [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=273.12s)]
*  was where farmers could hire people for those seasons. And there was a drastic, the immigrant, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=279.2s)]
*  illegal entry dropped because there was a more clear and lawful pathway for those that just wanted [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=286.08s)]
*  to come work. There was a plan. Yeah. They just wanted to come work, right? And they were willing [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=292.16s)]
*  to go back after the season. And that actually, we saw a drop historically in the number of illegal [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=296.0s)]
*  entries. So these are, I mean, we have proven it in the past that we can work and make things work. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=303.2s)]
*  In 1942, bracero program, an executive order called the Mexican farm labor program established [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=309.12s)]
*  the bracero program in 1942. This series of diplomatic accords between Mexico and the U S [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=314.32s)]
*  permitted millions of Mexican men to work legally in the U S on short-term labor contracts. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=320.0s)]
*  These agreements address the national agriculture labor shortage during the war, World War II, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=326.64s)]
*  and implicitly they redress previous depressionary deportations. During World War II, the U S sought [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=332.88s)]
*  labor from millions of braceros who would return to their country of origin after the work permit [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=337.84s)]
*  expired. Right. Okay. So that was like, so you're saying there was a drop then and if there was a, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=342.96s)]
*  because it was a plan in place. Right. And it was strictly, you know, for a lot of seasonal [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=347.52s)]
*  agriculture work. And then of course, when the plant, when they concluded the program, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=351.92s)]
*  obviously people were still wanting to come back. And so we saw an uptick in illegal entry. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=355.68s)]
*  There's some, you know, some nuances and stories about that program, like, you know, unions got [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=362.24s)]
*  involved and things like that. Then it became, you know, you know, you priced out the farmer. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=366.72s)]
*  So, Hey, you know what? I can't pay this kind of stuff, but it's an example that you can go back, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=370.88s)]
*  you know, from 1942 for another 20 years to the sixties that, Hey, you had a supply and demand. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=375.76s)]
*  You had, you had plenty of agricultural work. You had a demand for workers and it can, it can make [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=382.32s)]
*  sense. Right. We've done that with H one visas and things like that over, over time. We need to fix [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=387.92s)]
*  the leak in the boat. Right. Instead of, you know, just, you know, bailing out water, we need to fix [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=394.32s)]
*  leak. And that's the border security apparatus. That's the, what I like to talk about is like, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=401.68s)]
*  Hey, we really need Americans deserve to have a safe and, and, and, and secure border. Yeah. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=405.2s)]
*  And, and then we need to, you know, actually figure out better lawful, even short-term pathways [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=412.64s)]
*  for those that want to can work tall fences and wide gates. Tall fences is, is something that look, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=419.59999999999997s)]
*  it was actually Senator Fred Thompson, the late center Fred Thompson from Tennessee that talked [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=425.28s)]
*  about that kind of phrase back in 2008. I said, man, that resonated with me. So I'd, I'd kind of [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=429.84s)]
*  built off of that and said, look, if we secure our border, where it makes sense, where we need it, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=434.96s)]
*  the way, the way the border patrol says, Hey, this is the requirement. And we build out a wide gate. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=439.84s)]
*  That's the lawful pathways, the ports of entries, programs like bracero and other visa programs. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=444.96s)]
*  Cause so many of the migrants that I've talked to and people I know talk to, they just want to [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=450.4s)]
*  come work. They're not really wanting to come here and live here for very long or immigrate here. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=455.28s)]
*  They just want to come work and eventually go back. We've got to make that better. And they're, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=458.96s)]
*  they're using that influx of people all the time. I mean, even when I worked in, in farming, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=463.36s)]
*  there was, we always had some dudes sleeping above me or next to me or, you know, separate beds, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=467.92s)]
*  but yeah, same room. And he was Mexican and we would lay there at night and try to say stuff to [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=473.44s)]
*  each other and we couldn't, and then we would just go to sleep. But yeah, but yeah, you have [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=479.28000000000003s)]
*  to have a plan. It's like, you gotta have a plan. When did that start to change? So they had the [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=484.88s)]
*  bracero program. So that was working for a while. When did it start to change where things got out [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=490.24s)]
*  of control with the amount of people coming in? So, you know, we're going to fast forward. We're [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=495.6s)]
*  going to take a big leap because a lot of this stuff happened before I was even born, right? So [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=501.6s)]
*  in the seventies, you know, there was, it was steady, mainly Mexican adult men coming to work, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=505.84000000000003s)]
*  doing seasonal work in the eighties, the same thing, right? The same thing. They all came in, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=512.72s)]
*  they were looking for work. Even our farm and labor had not been, you know, industrialized so [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=517.28s)]
*  much. You know, we're still hand picking things, right? So we've always had that steady flow [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=523.12s)]
*  throughout history. In the eighties, in 1986, there was a lot of illegal immigrants here and [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=528.88s)]
*  President Reagan did an amnesty. That was, that's always the fix all politically. We'll do an amnesty, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=535.92s)]
*  we're going to clean the slate and we're going to really start doing some things. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=540.48s)]
*  Like you get grandfathered and what is an amnesty? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=543.68s)]
*  That's basically saying you've been grandfathered and you're here, you're here illegally, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=545.76s)]
*  we're going to let you stay. You made it like you're safe. It's almost like the guy in baseball, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=549.92s)]
*  the referee saying you're safe. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's, it's, you're already here. We're not going [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=552.88s)]
*  to, we're not going to deport you. Go ahead and try to start going through a legalization process. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=556.88s)]
*  You're here to work. And that's a huge pull factor because oftentimes the migrants know, hey, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=561.28s)]
*  if we can just get here and we lay low, eventually we may get some kind of amnesty. So that, that [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=567.84s)]
*  began again in the eighties. I came in in 1995. I joined the board of patrol in 1995. Okay. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=575.36s)]
*  It's, it's very interesting, especially in today's political times. I think it was 1994, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=582.8000000000001s)]
*  may have been early 95, but then president Clinton spoke at a state of the union and he talked about [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=588.16s)]
*  the crime bill, the 1994 crime bill, which is prevalent today because we know we have [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=594.96s)]
*  president Biden, who was a Senator back then in that speech, Clinton says we're going to put 5,000 [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=598.5600000000001s)]
*  more police officers on the street to include border guards. I was one of those 5,000 hires in [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=604.24s)]
*  1995. And it was based on some of the things that then Barbara Jordan had, had really spoken about. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=609.84s)]
*  We have to secure our border. We can't, we can't just have illegal immigration constantly, you [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=618.0s)]
*  know, threatening our, our, our businesses and everything else. So was the crime bill started [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=623.92s)]
*  because they needed to secure the border? It was just a general bill. Like we need more protection. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=628.08s)]
*  We want to put more people on the streets. So if you think about the crime bill, it had to do with [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=633.12s)]
*  gun control, had to do with police reforms, a lot of do with, you know, jail sentencing. So it wasn't [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=637.68s)]
*  the best bill, but it certainly got more police officers. And I got hired under it. So I, so I [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=644.4s)]
*  was in favor of it. But it was a general policy. It wasn't just about the border. No. Okay. Got it. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=648.4s)]
*  Right. So there's more police officers. It is the largest crime bill in the history of the United [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=652.48s)]
*  States and consisted of 356 pages that provided for 100,000 new police officers, $9.7 billion in [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=656.4s)]
*  funding for prisons, which were designed with significant input from experienced police officers. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=663.84s)]
*  Okay. Yeah. So the a hundred thousand, I think that was probably an end game and then probably [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=668.8s)]
*  included jailers and everything, but it specifically talked about 5,000 on the streets right away. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=672.48s)]
*  So that's how you get started. That's how I get started. And we were still, and I started in a [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=677.6s)]
*  town that's really, you know, I grew up from New Orleans. I grew up in Houston. And we can talk [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=682.24s)]
*  about some of my journeys over the, my career, but what's interesting is I had over 3000 people [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=687.76s)]
*  in my high school. I went to a, and after college and I joined the board of patrol, I went to a town, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=693.36s)]
*  Lordsburg, New Mexico, and the whole County had maybe 3000 people. It was, it was crazy, right? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=698.5600000000001s)]
*  The cultural shift from, you know, big urban life in Houston to, to the country. But, but I, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=704.5600000000001s)]
*  I'll tell you what, I fell in love with it. And, but I went almost 10 days before we made our first [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=709.6s)]
*  illegal alien arrest. I mean, it wasn't, things was just, weren't that busy. And it was mainly [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=715.52s)]
*  again, single adult Mexican nationals. Occasionally you would get people from like farm hands. Yeah, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=721.04s)]
*  that's pretty much what they're and, and, and kind of like what you were talking about earlier, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=727.76s)]
*  we lived out on a ranch when we were there and, and the, the landlord or landowner, he was like, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=731.52s)]
*  you know, they just, they come through here. Yeah. I've, I've watched them over generations. And, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=735.8399999999999s)]
*  and over time you would catch the same group every season because in New Mexico, it was big green, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=740.0799999999999s)]
*  a lot of green chili. So they were all a lot of chili picking and you would see these people. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=744.9599999999999s)]
*  And it was a cat and mouse game. It was fun. And you saw them, you know, a couple times a year, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=748.88s)]
*  cause you'd remove them and they'd come back and sometimes they get away. And people would probably [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=752.7199999999999s)]
*  leave water and food out for them at that point, because there was a, probably I'm sure when things [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=756.4s)]
*  are comfortable, there's a level of like sharing and caring that's able to be offered. I feel like [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=761.2s)]
*  when you're not operating from a place of fear. Yeah, you're exactly right. Because look, a lot [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=767.36s)]
*  of these folks would come through and they would, they would muck a stall. They, they'd mend a fence [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=771.92s)]
*  for food and a place to sleep. And then to continue on their journey. That was just the way of life. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=777.28s)]
*  And it wasn't, it really wasn't until the late nineties. So I'd been in a couple of years in [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=781.52s)]
*  the early two thousands, then we start seeing a change in aggression and more of a demanding [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=786.16s)]
*  mindset from the migrants. So, you know, even our culture in our society, we were getting a little [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=794.0s)]
*  bit more, our, our, our youth was a little bit more, you know, kind of rambunctious. And so we [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=799.28s)]
*  saw that transition even with the migrants. So then they were demanding that you feed them or [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=804.64s)]
*  stealing stuff. We were seeing that change, which, you know, that was, I think, just naturally [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=810.8000000000001s)]
*  occurring across society. It wasn't specific to the migrant. It was just, we had rebellion in our [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=815.76s)]
*  own streets, you know, that's interesting. Yeah. Cause we, cause we, they wouldn't fight back then. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=820.5600000000001s)]
*  Then all of a sudden they started fighting and resisting. You're like, okay, what's this all [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=825.44s)]
*  about? This never happened. I wonder if it was like, cause of like music influenced that or I don't [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=828.64s)]
*  know. I'm sure they would probably listen to different music. It's just interesting that that [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=833.52s)]
*  kind of, that's a big change. Yeah. Cause we saw, I started seeing a younger crowd coming in and the [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=836.72s)]
*  younger, I call them kids were a little more resistant than the older field farm workers. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=841.9200000000001s)]
*  They, they kind of knew like, all right, if I just give, you know, don't run from the border [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=847.6s)]
*  patrol, they'll feed me and they'll, I'll be back in Mexico in a couple hours and I can start, you [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=852.24s)]
*  know, a couple more days ago and you would catch sometimes, uh, I, we can talk stories here later, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=856.8000000000001s)]
*  but, but they started getting more aggressive. They tried more, get more aggressive. We started [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=861.6800000000001s)]
*  getting more aggressive. Maybe they were listening like easy E or something. It could have been, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=864.72s)]
*  you know, yeah. Um, it was, uh, it was interesting, right? We started seeing a change in a lot more [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=869.2s)]
*  of cartel control on the Southern, on the South, uh, the Mexican side. So that kind of started [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=876.88s)]
*  pushing some of the influence of where they were going to come through. And then, you know, we, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=882.72s)]
*  we noticed that the price to cross started increasing in the late nineties, early two thousands. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=886.64s)]
*  And I think that adds to the aggressiveness because they're dealing with, you know, bad actors, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=892.0s)]
*  right? The cartel is, is, is, you know, you want to cross to who you're going to have to pay. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=896.56s)]
*  Right. So now there's, yeah, there's a different energy coming over. It's not just a guy coming [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=900.32s)]
*  over to pick peaches or to be a part of, um, like kind of sharecropping, I guess, type of vibes. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=903.92s)]
*  Uh, it's somebody who's paid a cartel. Can you expound a little bit more on that? Like [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=909.76s)]
*  the cartels start to, uh, they start to recognize there's a business in letting people cross through [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=914.8s)]
*  the land on the Mexican side. Is that what you're talking about? Yeah. So, so people were, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=921.6s)]
*  we're still coming to look for work, right? Still going to do some of that, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=927.28s)]
*  you know, field work, but now they had to pay somebody to cross. So now they're like, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=930.96s)]
*  Hey, I don't want to lose the thousand bucks I paid to come through this area. Now I'm going [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=936.32s)]
*  to be a run. So I think that kind of increased some of the aggressiveness because look, they, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=941.28s)]
*  you know, or they may have been threatened. And so now it's like, Hey, that, that, that I just paid [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=945.6s)]
*  to come through here. Now, now border patrol is about to arrest me. I'm running or I'm fighting [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=951.28s)]
*  because if I have to go back, then I'm not to pay again. We started seeing that dynamic. And I think [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=955.76s)]
*  that may have been, uh, aside from just youth in general across the world, we're getting a little [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=960.88s)]
*  more, you know, you had more TV, you had more shows, you know, we had still hadn't had the [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=966.0s)]
*  onset of internet and things like that yet, but I think that was the shift. And then, you know, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=970.4s)]
*  obviously we talk about the cartel because that is, that is a big business. Yeah. But just to [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=975.04s)]
*  interject. So that was because the, when you say that people were having to pay to come, they were [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=979.12s)]
*  having to pay a cartel. Yes. Yeah. There was a Plaza boss in every area along the border, right? [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=982.8s)]
*  It's run by the bigger cartel. So, you know, if you want to cross near Palomas, Mexico, which was [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=988.24s)]
*  near my area, um, you're going to have to pay a Plaza boss. So if you're going to come through here [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=994.88s)]
*  to, to work your way to, you know, a small farming community in, in New Mexico, and you had to pay, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1000.08s)]
*  you don't want to have, you, you don't want to have to go back because you got to pay again. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1007.44s)]
*  Now you got skin in the game. Yeah. Or, or even worse, if you didn't pay and you snuck in around [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1010.5600000000001s)]
*  the Plaza boss and you get returned back, the Plaza boss is going to say, Hey, wait a second, [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1016.88s)]
*  I don't remember you paying me. Yeah. And that could, that could cost them their lives because, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1022.8000000000001s)]
*  you know, the cartel was pretty ruthless, you know? So I think that combined with just [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1026.8s)]
*  change overall in general of society across the world, you know, just kind of bumped it up. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1031.76s)]
*  And it was in the late nineties and early two thousands. And, you know, on top of all that, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1036.4s)]
*  we started a little bit more forward deployment and posture of the enforcement side. So it became [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1040.32s)]
*  a little bit more difficult to get across. So there was a, it's a combination of several things [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1045.92s)]
*  and it kind of plays into the overall story where we are today. Wow. Yeah. It's really interesting, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1050.64s)]
*  man. So, um, what is the current immigration policy? Is that a fair question? So it depends on, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1056.4s)]
*  so again, it's so vast. Like, are you coming over here as a tourist? Then you get a visa for six [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1063.0400000000002s)]
*  months. So, yeah. Okay. So what, you know, coming to work, you gotta get a work, you gotta have a [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1067.2800000000002s)]
*  passport and a worker visa. I think what we want to talk about is like, Hey, what's happening at [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1071.44s)]
*  the border right now? And why are we in this mess? Right. And I think we can, we can kind of walk [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1075.68s)]
*  through that because, because I think it's important for you and the audience to know, like to come to [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1080.24s)]
*  the United States, you have to have permission. And that's starts with a passport and a visa. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1085.68s)]
*  Now there are so many types of visas from, you know, from entertainment to family to work. And [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1091.68s)]
*  it really just depends on what it is you're after. If you're coming here and you have a valid passport [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1098.24s)]
*  and you have a, you want to be a, a tourist for six months, you get a tourist visa. Um, and you, [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1104.0800000000002s)]
*  you get it stamped and you fly in or drive in, you come to the port of entry and you're free to move [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1110.16s)]
*  about the country for six months. If you overstay, then you could be deported, but most tourist visas [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1114.0s)]
*  are for six months. And in that window, you, okay. So why do people not want to use the pathways, [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1119.44s)]
*  the legal pathways to immigration? Like it takes too much time. It's, it's the line so long. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1125.84s)]
*  And that's when you hear people say the system is broken. It's because there's so many people [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1132.4s)]
*  in the system and the line to come in the right way is so long. I mean, for example, if, if you're [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1136.56s)]
*  a small business owner and you can't find the workforce you need to maintain your business, [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1142.96s)]
*  it would take you probably two years, about $10,000. You got to deal with about four federal [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1148.96s)]
*  agencies to try to get those employees. Meanwhile, if you're just a startup and you're trying to, [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1155.6000000000001s)]
*  to start things up, you could, you could lose business, lose that opportunity. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1161.92s)]
*  It's so it's because it's so convoluted and so, uh, so long to wait. I mean, if you need business, [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1166.4s)]
*  if you need employees from right, right. Out of country, anywhere from anywhere out of country, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1172.4s)]
*  anywhere. Okay. Uh, and so it de-incentivizes because I'm, you know, for a small company to say, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1177.2800000000002s)]
*  I've got to spend this money and I may have to wait years to even get those employees, [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1183.1200000000001s)]
*  but I can hire this guy off the street now and nobody's asked any questions. That's why we've [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1186.48s)]
*  got to really clean up this mess, right? Let's there's, we, there's people that like, they call [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1190.48s)]
*  it the death visa. They've waited for so long, like literally 20 or 30 years to get over here that [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1195.3600000000001s)]
*  they'll, it just, they, they've got to really work on that. And I do believe that if we can come up [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1201.76s)]
*  with that wide gate, that clear pathway that will to some extent reduce the humanity that's coming [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1208.32s)]
*  in illegally, that's causing our security vulnerabilities. Yeah. And when you say like, [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1215.6s)]
*  uh, people to being, being hired and, and businesses having to wait a long time, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1220.64s)]
*  most of those businesses, we're just thinking like, uh, labor type of work. Is that what we're [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1225.12s)]
*  saying? Probably most cases, but you still have, you still have, you know, STEM type, uh, uh, [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1230.4s)]
*  businesses where, um, you know, people have to, you know, there's there, there was work [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1234.96s)]
*  visas established, I think in the late sixties, about 144,000 of non-immigrant work visas, uh, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1239.68s)]
*  certain criteria. And that's not a lot of, a lot of visas for people from, and then every country [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1246.3200000000002s)]
*  has a bite at that 144,000, I think is the number. And that's still all we have. Yeah. They haven't [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1251.52s)]
*  changed it. It's 2024. Why? I mean, and that I think is where the frustration lies when you see [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1256.8s)]
*  that's how many work visas can you, non-immigrant, non-immigrant visas. Uh, there is, uh, uh, uh, [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1262.1599999999999s)]
*  it's, I think it's around 140 front and some thousand. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. And what does that [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1268.0s)]
*  mean? Non-immigrant visas. They're not coming here to immigrate and stay. They're just here to work. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1271.84s)]
*  Oh my gosh. That's so few. Yeah. Yeah. You, when you, when you put that in perspective, [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1275.84s)]
*  how many people are getting caught and released into the country and they're looking at, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1279.44s)]
*  oh, well, we want to give them work opportunities while they're waiting on their hearing, but yet [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1283.2s)]
*  you've had an, a quota established for over 50 years and you haven't willing to change that. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1286.8s)]
*  What about the poor people have been waiting in line to get that work visa? What about the business [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1292.0s)]
*  owner that has been waiting his turn to, to hire people? So these are the first people from wanting [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1296.0s)]
*  to do it legally at a certain point. Spot on, spot on. Why, why wouldn't they want to change the work [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1301.44s)]
*  visa? Why wouldn't they want to add more? Has it become, man, I think if I could answer that [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1308.08s)]
*  question, you know, we would solve a lot of problems and it's Congress, it's Congress. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1312.88s)]
*  And, and this is one of my, one of, when people, we talk about the problem and, and, you know, it's, [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1317.8400000000001s)]
*  it's, we don't need the bureaucrats and the elected officials in Washington making these decisions. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1323.68s)]
*  We need them to go to, we, the people go talk to the business owners, talk to the community leaders, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1330.96s)]
*  talk to the hospital staff, talk to the mayors, the county commissioners say, what is it that you [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1336.3200000000002s)]
*  need to attract and attain the best and brightest to come over here? What is it that you need to [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1341.04s)]
*  maintain your lifestyle and your community as an elected official, you know, or, you know, that's [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1346.32s)]
*  where those decisions get rolled up. And then Congress, you know, passes a bill that says, [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1352.32s)]
*  this is what we're going to do. If we're just relying on bureaucrats and elected officials that [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1356.72s)]
*  are in Washington, they're just doing it because of interest, you know, lobbyists. Right. It's [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1361.28s)]
*  lobbyists. They're talking to the people who says, you know, because think about it, if you're, you're, [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1366.0s)]
*  if you're in a community that says, Hey, I'm trying to build this. I need some, I need fresh [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1370.56s)]
*  employee workforce. I don't have it here locally, but somebody from another representative from [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1375.52s)]
*  another part of the country makes a bill that doesn't impact you or impacts you and negatively, [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1380.1599999999999s)]
*  that's not representative. So we really, we really need we, the people represented. And I know that's, [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1385.28s)]
*  that's kind of a very naive approach, but it is what is necessary, especially if we want to [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1390.56s)]
*  solve this immigration issue. We, we know we have labor shortages. We know that there are people [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1395.92s)]
*  that want to come over here and provide or, and do good. Let's, let's hear from the experts. And [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1400.8000000000002s)]

*  up with the solutions and Congress needs to support it. That unfortunately, it just seems [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1418.3200000000002s)]

*  was that also a reason like, where is there something happening in Mexico that we don't [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1562.32s)]
*  know that people were like, okay, we have to get out of here. That was causing more people to come. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1566.0s)]
*  No, no. And in fact, uh, there's been a, there's been an evolution, uh, and change in, [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1570.24s)]
*  and I don't know if evolution is the right word, but a change in demographics over the last [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1575.84s)]
*  decade or more. Again, when I first started, it was mainly single adult Mexican nationals. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1580.08s)]
*  We started seeing an influx. Yeah. A guy with some sandwiches and water coming to work. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1584.48s)]
*  It was what it was, right? Um, then we started seeing an uptick in central Americans, you know, [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1589.84s)]
*  the Northern triangle, Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala. Um, we started seeing that show up in [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1595.68s)]
*  the, you know, they were always coming, but it was what we started seeing uptick in the mid 2000s. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1601.2s)]
*  In the 2000 teens, really 2012, 13, we started seeing a big change of family units and [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1607.1200000000001s)]
*  unaccompanied children and mainly central Americans in the last five or six years. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1615.44s)]
*  It's been a world problem. I was the chief of Yuma from December of 2020 to December 31st, [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1623.1200000000001s)]
*  2022. So just over two years as the chief of that sector, rarely did Mexico or central American [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1631.68s)]
*  countries make my top 10 daily or weekly numbers. It was all over the world. I led, and so that's [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1640.48s)]
*  been the phenomena that's changed over the last few years is, and that's another misnomer that [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1646.8s)]
*  most people think it's a Mexican problem or it's central America. No, it's not. It's, it's a, it's [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1653.68s)]
*  a people from all over the world coming in to this country. Here's an article right here says [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1660.0s)]
*  Chinese migrants pouring across Southern border spark national security concerns. More than 20,000 [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1665.2s)]
*  Chinese nationals have illegally crossed since the new fiscal year began on October 1st. Is that true? [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1670.96s)]
*  Yes. Yes. There was a, uh, uh, today's Wednesday. So I think Tuesday, Monday or Tuesday, there was [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1676.16s)]
*  two almost 270 in San Diego alone. 270 Chinese people. Yeah. Chinese, where are they coming from [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1682.08s)]
*  China? Coming from China to Mexico and up the gut to the United States. So that that's, that's [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1687.44s)]
*  since October 20,000. And here's the other thing too. A lot of these Chinese nationals and a lot [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1691.6000000000001s)]
*  of the people that we're catching and we're seeing down there are a single adult men, like 18 to 45 [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1697.68s)]
*  year old range. I was, I was in, uh, uh, Eagle Pass, Texas, uh, right before Christmas. And I was down [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1703.68s)]
*  in Lukeville, Arizona right before Christmas when those places were really popping and there'd be [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1708.56s)]
*  a thousand people on the ground there. 800 to be single adult men. And the other 200 to be families [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1713.84s)]
*  and some kids. So does that mean that it's getting back to the traditional like element that you're [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1718.72s)]
*  talking about? Oh, no, it's that's the, those, these are, these are people, a traditional element [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1722.72s)]
*  of being a single adult, Mexican national. These are single adults from Mauritania, from, uh, New [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1727.28s)]
*  Guinea, from West African countries, from China, from, you know, uh, um, just you, you name it. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1732.32s)]
*  They were coming from all over the world. And, and, and it's also important though, this is, [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1738.3999999999999s)]
*  this is how they get here. They, they fly in to Mexico city or Cancun on a tourist visa. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1742.32s)]
*  And then at least when I was in, uh, in Yuma, they would fly from Mexico city to Baja California [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1750.32s)]
*  on that same tourist visa. And then they would take a shuttle bus to the border, uh, 45 minutes [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1759.12s)]
*  away and then come across. Um, uh, they're still doing that and they're just coming up different, [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1763.84s)]
*  different locations. So they, they fly from all over the world, uh, into Mexico city. There is [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1769.2s)]
*  still a lots of groups that will fly into South America and go up through the Darien gap into [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1773.44s)]
*  Panama and into, um, central America and work their way the traditional migrant route. But a [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1779.8400000000001s)]
*  lot of them are flying in and they're, they're really crossing the desert for 45 minutes, maybe. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1785.52s)]
*  Oh, they're not yet. Nobody wants to work anymore. I mean, nobody, yeah, it's like, [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1790.24s)]
*  even when it comes to migration here, but he's just cutting corners or like [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1794.48s)]
*  taking the easy route, I guess. But, um, so that's unbelievable to me that it's so diverse. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1798.4s)]
*  Yeah. So what are all these guys doing? Like, are they like, are these people whose families [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1805.2s)]
*  have been here and they couldn't get here to them who've been waiting for a visa? Are these people [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1812.4s)]
*  who are, um, need a job and they have a skillset that they, something has happened in their country [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1816.8000000000002s)]
*  like religiously or, uh, like, um, like, uh, with a change in government or something, they don't [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1824.1599999999999s)]
*  have, like, or is it bad people? Is it okay? Or is it good? Is it all, who is it? It's, it's, it's, [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1831.12s)]
*  it's really a, a, a potpourri of all of this, right? Um, so you hear the term asylum seeker [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1836.8s)]
*  thrown out a lot. Many of these people are not seeking asylum. Okay. And what does that mean? [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1842.8s)]
*  Asylum seeker. So that has been a narrative change that, uh, uh, a lot of people on the [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1846.3999999999999s)]
*  progressive side, open border mindsets is everybody's here trying to seek asylum. They [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1852.24s)]
*  want a better life. Well, we all want a better life, but there, there are certain standards to [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1855.76s)]
*  meet asylum. Asylum means you are, uh, you are pretty much being persecuted for, you know, your, [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1859.76s)]
*  uh, uh, uh, gender, your, uh, religion, your political affiliation, you know, living in a bad [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1865.2s)]
*  neighborhood, not finding a job, getting beat up by a gang is not asylum. It may be a rough life, [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1872.16s)]
*  but they're- Right. That's true. That's Jacksonville. So they'll, they'll just basically say [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1876.4s)]
*  everybody is asylum. That's not true. Okay. They, and by the way, there are two types of asylum, [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1880.72s)]
*  and this is, you know, I'm going to get too much into this, but there's an affirmative claim where [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1887.3600000000001s)]
*  you are leaving your country because of you're being persecuted for these reasons. And you fill [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1891.84s)]
*  out like, I am seeking asylum. Like I am filling out a, I think it's a 595 form and I fill it out [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1898.88s)]
*  to the, I need asylum because I'm being threatened for this, that, and the other thing. And, and [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1905.2s)]
*  that's an affirmative, somebody outwardly seeking. Let's, for example, you are, and there's a piece [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1910.32s)]
*  in that asylum, uh, affirmative claim. It says, regardless of your status at entry, in other words, [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1915.36s)]
*  regardless, if you're here legally or not, you can affirmative seek asylum. If you meet a criteria [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1921.52s)]
*  that, for example, let's say you're a student on a visa, you're a student from the Ukraine and [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1927.28s)]
*  the semester's out and you, your visa is about to expire, but you, you're, you want to go home for [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1933.6s)]
*  the summer. Um, but there's a war breaking out in your country. I am in your neighborhood's been [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1938.96s)]
*  destroyed. So you can apply for asylum and let's say your visa expired, right? Because you're [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1944.88s)]
*  waiting to get your plane ticket and now you've out of status. So you're here illegally, but because [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1950.0s)]
*  of situation, you can affirm new claim for asylum because you have, there's nothing there. So that's [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1955.52s)]
*  a way that is by, seems like the way the law should be used. Yes, absolutely. Something's changed. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1961.6000000000001s)]
*  Yes, you are out of status now, but you can't go back to your country. Your government's in shambles. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1968.0s)]
*  I need to stay here. I need to stay in. That's perfect. That's, that's what the laws are for. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1973.52s)]
*  Right. Your government's killing women. Your government's killing gays, your government, [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1977.84s)]
*  there's a war. And I, and I can't go back, you know, people, but, but people are abusing that. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1981.12s)]
*  Right. So well, that one, not so much the other one where I was going is the defensive claim and [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1986.16s)]
*  that's under a credible fear claim. So you cross the border illegally. You are arrested by border [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1992.0s)]
*  patrol, border patrol process you for removal during the process and removal is deportation. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=1998.48s)]
*  So you're going to get your hearing in front of the judge. We ask you if you have credible fear [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2004.64s)]
*  of return to your country. Well, most of them say yes, because then we ask a few other questions [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2009.52s)]
*  and they get to go have a credible fear screening. Now, nine out of 10 people do not meet the [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2017.28s)]
*  criteria for credible fear, but it gives them an extra bite at the apple anytime during the process, [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2024.96s)]
*  because they're just coming to look for work. They're from a bad neighborhood or they had an [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2031.28s)]
*  abusive relationship. That's not asylum, but they can use credible fear and asylum as a defensive [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2035.12s)]
*  claim. And that's what the majority of these people that we're encountering are using that as a, [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2041.44s)]
*  credible fear asylum claim. And also on asylum, just in general is you're supposed to seek asylum [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2047.36s)]
*  in the first asylum country you step foot in. So if you, it would be Mexico, it would be Mexico, [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2055.92s)]
*  which is why the policy of the remain in Mexico, the migrant protection protocol, so many people [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2061.2s)]
*  were coming into the United States after passing through multiple countries that were asylum [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2066.72s)]
*  countries, but they were claiming it. Oh, I want it here. Can you send people back based on that? [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2070.96s)]
*  Or can you reject people based on that? Like, so what we did under the, under the, uh, [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2077.04s)]
*  the Trump administration is we created the migrant protection protocol and said, all right, you're [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2081.36s)]
*  here. You pass New Mexico, you, you want asylum. Um, you should have claimed it Mexico. We would [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2085.92s)]
*  send them back to Mexico to wait for their hearing here. When that happened, the numbers just drop. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2091.6s)]
*  People realize we just closed that loophole because they didn't want to wait Mexico's because they, [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2096.0s)]
*  because they, if you were really seeking asylum, if you were being persecuted, you take refuge in [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2099.44s)]
*  the first place. You could seek refuge. Okay. And some people are flying through multiple countries. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2103.6s)]
*  Look, if you, if you were from Pakistan and you were, uh, uh, targeted because your religion, [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2109.7599999999998s)]
*  and you got on a plane and flew to Germany, asylum country, you flew from Germany to UK, [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2116.96s)]
*  asylum country, you flew from UK to Mexico, asylum country, you cross the border illegally. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2121.7599999999998s)]
*  The United States, oh no, I want asylum. Okay. You're playing a game here, man. Yeah. It may [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2126.72s)]
*  be the better place of all those countries, but if you're using asylum, you should have got off the [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2131.52s)]
*  plane in Germany and said, I need help. I need to seek refuge. And then, and then again, and that's, [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2136.56s)]
*  that's the loopholes that some of the policies that we had in place close and the numbers. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2141.2s)]
*  And I'm going to tell you the numbers because you can see where all this, where all this works. Let [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2146.08s)]
*  me, let me, let me just take this here. And so once people can just say, I'm here to seek asylum, [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2150.8s)]
*  does that limit the border patrol agents? Do you then have to follow a script? Like there's no, [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2155.6s)]
*  like once somebody says a certain thing, like, do you then have to go by a script and there's [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2160.96s)]
*  nothing else you can do? Yeah. So the great question. And so we're processing somebody for [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2166.2400000000002s)]
*  what we usually call a notice to appear. In other words, you're being, you're being processed for [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2172.32s)]
*  an appearance in front of a judge to be removed or make your claim. And we asked them if you claim [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2176.8s)]
*  fear, if they say no, it's just check a box. No. And you continue to process and you would turn [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2182.96s)]
*  them over to immigration and customs enforcement for detention. If there's spaces to hold them, [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2189.44s)]
*  if they say yes, it is five additional questions for us that we have to answer. And I don't recall [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2194.96s)]
*  the questions anymore. They need to get answered. Yeah. So if they say yes, I have fear. Yeah. I [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2201.44s)]
*  fear I want asylum. We asked these five questions and there's a form that we put on there. And so [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2206.2400000000002s)]
*  that case goes into a credible hearing process. In other words, they're going to get in front of a [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2212.8s)]
*  an asylum officer to go through that. And again, that just gives them an opportunity to stay a [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2219.52s)]
*  little bit longer until that asylum officer decides, yeah, you meet the basic criteria [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2224.96s)]
*  and then you'll get in front of a judge, you know, at a later date. But yeah, absolutely. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2230.08s)]
*  When somebody claims fear or claims they want asylum, we have a protocol, an extra form that [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2234.48s)]
*  we fill out and we take care of that. Yeah. So that's, that's another thing that was always kind [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2240.4s)]
*  of a misnomer is like, Oh, board of trojans are making those decisions. No, we're not. I say it's [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2244.64s)]
*  five extra questions. It's really easy for us. Yeah. It says right here. Unfortunately, [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2248.96s)]
*  a growing number of asylum seekers are well versed in our laws and more importantly, [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2252.96s)]
*  what they need to say in order to get a foot beyond the first asylum hearing. As a result, [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2256.96s)]
*  many individuals claim credible fear of persecution in the hopes of being released [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2261.36s)]
*  are allowed to remain in the U S this creates several significant problems and proper claims [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2265.36s)]
*  clog the system and denial, legitimate asylum seekers, a swift education, adjudication, [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2270.4s)]
*  thanks of their claims to the U S government must devote valuable resources to the care, [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2276.7999999999997s)]
*  shelter and processing of large numbers of people who likely will not be ruled eligible for asylum [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2282.4s)]
*  or similar, similar protections. And number three, the longer the asylum loophole exists, [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2287.2s)]
*  there will be human traffickers and false asylum seekers who will abuse the system and put their [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2292.3199999999997s)]
*  own lives at risk too. Yep. That's, that's, that's, what does that mean? So they're coached that this [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2297.68s)]
*  is the marketing piece of, so the cartel and I'll use the cartel and smuggling organization, [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2304.48s)]
*  interchangeable. I mean, cartel is the hierarchy. They're the ones, the big boss and each one of [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2310.64s)]
*  them have their commodity neutral, whether it's people or things, they're going to smuggle it and [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2314.0s)]
*  pay for it, whatever. Okay. And they own, they own kind of Plaza space. What'd you call it? [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2317.92s)]
*  Her report. The Plaza boss was somebody that owned like the area near the crossings where [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2322.2400000000002s)]
*  people are going to cross. And they may not own the land, but they, they're the mafia there. Yeah. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2326.72s)]
*  That's basically it. Okay. Differences is, you know, it's the cartel really has got [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2329.68s)]
*  huge influence over the so much, but to those bullets, it's a real mafia, not like our mafia. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2335.52s)]
*  It was like, yeah, a couple of guys. So I used to kind of compare the two, but you know, you, [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2341.04s)]
*  the, the, the mafia back in the day here in the United States, you know, you wouldn't need a, [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2347.04s)]
*  a military to take it out where the cartel is, is well, well armed and well financed to handle [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2353.68s)]
*  things. And you know, police officers are not going to go take out the cartel. Right. Right. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2359.44s)]
*  But those, those three bullets, you kind of paraphrase. And that is number one, the, [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2363.84s)]
*  the rhetoric that goes on in our political and media sphere in the United States, [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2368.8s)]
*  and you say rhetoric, what do you mean? Oh, they're asylum seekers. We need to do this. We need to, [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2372.7200000000003s)]
*  you know, you know, the false choices of either for border security or you're anti-immigrant or [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2376.48s)]
*  you're, you're, you're, you're for immigration. That means you're an open border person. No. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2380.96s)]
*  So the bad guys are, we'll listen to all this. Right. So, so they hear this, oh, asylum seeker. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2385.52s)]
*  Okay. This is going to be our marketing point. I'm going to charge you whatever I charge you. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2391.36s)]
*  I'll give you the information. I'll tell you how, what that thing is to answer and say, [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2396.0s)]
*  and then you clog the system up. And since there's no room at the end, in other words, [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2399.04s)]
*  there's no place to detain them. Once we've caught them, they get released and that's what they want [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2403.68s)]
*  because they're going to, they're, they're in the United States. They are going to find work. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2409.28s)]
*  Generally that's going to be below board. That other, that third bullet is the one that should [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2415.28s)]
*  concern every one of us. If we're really going to make this a humanitarian issue, which it really is, [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2420.48s)]
*  is the human traffickers because it's so real. So many people do not realize they are in this [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2425.52s)]
*  trafficking vortex until it's too late. There are stories out there and we don't need to even [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2435.28s)]
*  go that way today. But I can just tell you that it is real. It's what I'm pretty much [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2441.1200000000003s)]
*  dedicate my life to now, looking for solutions. And we can talk about some of that down the road [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2446.6400000000003s)]
*  here, but let me just say this. So many people, well, let's just, let's cut to the chase here. So [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2451.92s)]
*  these people are, are, are looking, are being sold a bill of goods that they're going to be able to [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2459.84s)]
*  come over here and live the American dream. All right. It's so controlled by cartels and [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2464.16s)]
*  trafficking organizations that you have, you know, um, it's, they're recharging anywhere from 5,000 [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2469.2799999999997s)]
*  to $15,000 a person to come across. People don't have that kind of money. So they're going to have [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2475.8399999999997s)]
*  to pay that off indentured servitude, whether it's going to be put them in the forced labor [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2480.3999999999996s)]
*  or prostitution, things like that, uh, narcotics smuggling, all that. So people are paying that. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2484.7999999999997s)]
*  They'll say you'll do it in trade. Yes. Or they don't know that like, Hey, yeah, [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2490.8s)]
*  give me, give me your 20,000 for the four of us to come across. Well, I'll have 20,000. Okay. Well, [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2495.52s)]
*  give me, give me what you got. And I know where you live and I'll get you, I'll put you to work [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2500.88s)]
*  when you get there and you can pay off your debt. Sounds like a great deal until they realize what [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2505.44s)]
*  they have to do. If what was real, this is real. You'd have families show up at the border in [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2508.88s)]
*  Mexico. They're still in Mexico through the cartel organization, the smuggling or trafficking [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2517.36s)]
*  organization. Say, okay, this husband and this husband are going to swap wives. This kid's going [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2522.32s)]
*  to go with this single adult and that's going to be a family. You two are now a family. You two are [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2528.88s)]
*  now a family. You're going to cross in California. You're going to cross in Arizona. And then when [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2534.0s)]
*  you get released, you play the script. When you get released, y'all can be reunited. Now, [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2539.44s)]
*  that made it because if they were families, they faced a different, they would be released. God, [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2545.04s)]
*  we weren't detaining family units. So they combine people. And by the way, it would just be released. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2549.12s)]
*  Yeah. The process, there's no place to hold family units. So, so if things were full and you were a [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2553.92s)]
*  family and you came across and you guys caught them, we'd process them and we release them [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2558.08s)]
*  and just release them into America, into America to the nonprofits and the nonprofits would facilitate. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2563.04s)]
*  So here's what happened. So now, so if that was my wife with some other guy being pushed across [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2567.7599999999998s)]
*  someplace else, a hundred miles away, I'm going to do whatever it takes to ensure her safety, [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2573.68s)]
*  which means I'm going to play that script. I'm going to pay that debt and pray that I get to [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2579.2799999999997s)]
*  reunite with her in the next few days. That's, that's the, the mental trauma. And by the way, [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2584.3199999999997s)]
*  my kids are involved in this. So I'm hoping that I at least got my kid with me or she's got a kid, [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2590.08s)]
*  but they'll separate those families on the south side of the border to control and manipulate. So [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2596.3199999999997s)]
*  I won't say a word because number one, you know where I'm from, you know where I'm going. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2602.0s)]
*  You've got my family. So I'm just going to keep my mouth shut and I'm just going to play the game [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2607.68s)]
*  and I'm going to just try to get through this without being discovered by border [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2613.04s)]
*  patrol that this isn't really my family. We catch. I was afraid they're going to be ratted out. Is [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2617.36s)]
*  that what you're saying? Like what, why would they know the cartels really aren't worried about [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2622.24s)]
*  being ratted out. Well, I'm just, I'm curious, but they, they've, they've tell the migrants [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2625.6s)]
*  if you rat me out, if you squeal, they're not going to get paid. So we're going to take it out [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2630.7999999999997s)]
*  on you. So it's, it is completely mental and emotional human exploitation. So I guess I'm [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2636.7999999999997s)]
*  still confused and I don't know why they could have just been, I didn't sleep much, but, um, [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2644.3199999999997s)]
*  so they'll mix and match the families and send them over control. You're going to pay, oh, [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2649.04s)]
*  you're going to pay me the money that I, that you owe me. Or if you want to be reunited with [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2656.64s)]
*  your family and you can't pay, I'm putting her to work over here. That's, that's the, the mind, [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2661.2799999999997s)]
*  the mind control game that's happening. So, so much of this was again, and we were caught up in this [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2668.72s)]
*  as agents too, right? So you'd have, oh, they're separating families or the families are being [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2674.16s)]
*  separated and released. We didn't know we had, you catch a thousand people in, in eight hours. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2679.92s)]
*  You don't have all the time and the resources to, to dedicate to ask every question that you [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2687.44s)]
*  should be asking because you kind of pick up on things, right? When, why this, the, the, the, [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2693.2000000000003s)]
*  the wife is not talking and the guy is giving all the instructions. I mean, when you have time, [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2698.64s)]
*  you can pick up on that stuff, but when you have got so many people coming and you're overwhelmed, [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2703.12s)]
*  we miss those things. And that's what I used to get asked, what would keep us, keep me up at night [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2707.92s)]
*  chief. And I'd be like, well, my agent's wellbeing, but then the people that we, we missed because we [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2712.2400000000002s)]
*  know that was happening. And when you can't do anything, you can't say, Hey, this seems suspect. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2717.76s)]
*  If it does. Oh yeah, absolutely. And we would, we would bust up these fraud families when we had the [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2723.04s)]
*  resources and the time to do it. When we weren't overwhelmed with, look, Theo, the numbers, let me, [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2728.2400000000002s)]
*  let me tell you, let's put this kind of in perspective, why this becomes a challenge [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2733.6s)]
*  in, I think it was 2019. We had a, just over 900,000 arrests in the Southwest border in 2020. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2737.36s)]
*  That number dropped to 400, just over 400,000 because we put, we had wall being built, we had [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2746.24s)]
*  technology being employed. We had strong policies in place that were closing loopholes. I mean, [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2751.84s)]
*  we reduced the number of illegal entries over half. Well, we had a change of administrations [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2756.4s)]
*  and all that got basically put aside. We went from just over 400,000 arrests in 2020 to [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2762.08s)]
*  1.66 million in 2021 arrests, 2.2 million in 2022 in 23. I think the number was around 2.4. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2771.92s)]
*  So, and we didn't increase border patrol agents. So when you look at the number of people, [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2783.44s)]
*  the number of people, it just becomes a math problem. I was, when I was chief in Yuma, [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2790.8s)]
*  the, in 2020, the year that I got there, so federal fiscal year ended in September 30th, [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2798.48s)]
*  we had just over 8,800 arrests that year. I was like, this is going to be great. That's, [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2805.84s)]
*  those are fun arrests for border patrol agents, right? I was just, you know, I just, and not to [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2810.0s)]
*  interrupt you, I guess I am, but I just saw this the other day, and this was in the New York Times, [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2814.24s)]
*  an immigration shift. And it had a graph in here. Can you go down? [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2821.3599999999997s)]
*  Annual Southwestern border apprehensions. And it showed, yeah, in 2020, you were at [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2829.8399999999997s)]
*  less than half a million. That's the 400,000 I was talking about. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2837.04s)]
*  And then in 2022, up to 2.21 million, that's almost five times. That's almost five and a half [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2840.48s)]
*  times. And that's only border patrol arrests because what they're doing now is they're playing [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2850.64s)]
*  numbers. Those that are illegally arriving at the ports are not included in that. So there's, [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2855.76s)]
*  there's still another 500,000 that were released by the ports. But so let's, let's put that in [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2860.48s)]
*  perspective. There's only 18,000 border patrol agents in the entire United States. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2866.08s)]
*  Southern border is about 16,000, then the rest of the Northern and the coastal. So you do that [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2871.84s)]
*  math and you look at shift work, you look at days off. I mean, you're really outnumbered 201 [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2877.6s)]
*  every day in certain areas. So think about this in 2020, we had just over 8,800 arrests in Yuma [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2883.36s)]
*  with a little over 900 border patrol agents to include myself, right? 8,800 arrests. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2890.96s)]
*  And it went up to 114,000 in 2021. So we went from 8,800 to 114,000 arrests. And in 2022, [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2895.7599999999998s)]
*  it went up to 310,000 arrests. And I still had the 950 more or less border patrol agents. So we [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2907.2s)]
*  didn't, I mean, I was literally out there as chief, you know, I wasn't processing, but I would be out [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2913.68s)]
*  there with the men and women and I go out to the border and literally see 500 people at a time [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2918.7999999999997s)]
*  walking through a hole in the wall, you know? And so can you do, can sometimes you just have, [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2923.76s)]
*  or sometimes as a border patrol agent, are you so out manned and overwhelmed that all you can do [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2929.6000000000004s)]
*  is watch them go by? Yeah. Well, so a lot of these people were given up. Yeah. So a lot of these [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2936.7200000000003s)]
*  people here, here's the thing, the cartel is controlling where they're coming through, right? [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2941.36s)]
*  So they knew, they knew they were delivering 200 to 500 people at a time. Are they strategic about [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2945.76s)]
*  it? Yes, absolutely. Absolutely. Put them right there. These people weren't running from us. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2950.72s)]
*  They were giving themselves up because they were wanting to come to the United States. Here's the [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2956.16s)]
*  kicker. And that's fine. They weren't running. There was always going to be something going on [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2961.4399999999996s)]
*  in that group. There's usually a sick person or there's maybe a woman in labor or, you know, [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2965.7599999999998s)]
*  the agents had to respond. But while we're diverting our resources to handle that group of 100, 200 to [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2970.7999999999997s)]
*  500, what do you think's happening 10 miles the other way? The people we really should be going [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2976.72s)]
*  after are jumping over the fence and taking off and running into the neighborhoods and getting [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2982.0s)]
*  smuggled out. I mean, that's the kind of things that are happening right now. And here's the, [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2986.24s)]
*  the other thing, like let's send a hundred right here. And then in the meantime, listen, a thousand [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2991.04s)]
*  over there when there's some response. Yes. So they're going to, we're going to put all our [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2995.52s)]
*  resources into that one. The cartel was controlling our border operations that way. In other words, [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=2998.48s)]
*  controlling, oh, they were manipulating the situation. Yep. I'm going to send a couple [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3004.16s)]
*  hundred people here. That's going to get a response by border patrol. Meanwhile, the 10 criminals that [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3008.3999999999996s)]
*  are, you know, either prior deports, potential terrorists, drug runners, we're going to send [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3014.0s)]
*  them a mile the other direction because all the resources went there. And that's how, you know, [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3018.64s)]
*  this has happened. Look at the gotaways. Those are the gotaways that, that, you know, people talk so [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3023.92s)]
*  much about, there's been a half a million gotaways every year the last few years, and we have no idea [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3027.6s)]
*  who they are. And there is in the country. They're in the country. See, that's the part like, [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3031.52s)]
*  I am all for, um, legal immigration. Yep. I'm all for like, I don't think it's fair that I get to be [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3035.92s)]
*  born in a place that is like, or that somebody has to be born in a place where they have to suffer [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3043.36s)]
*  or struggle or that they, like, I feel like people should be able to go, but I do feel like we can [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3049.6s)]
*  have an organized plan because if we don't, if you don't have an inventory, if you don't know [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3057.84s)]
*  what's on your shelves, you can't like accurately offer aid. You can't accurately, um, have teachers [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3062.8s)]
*  in a community. You can't, um, you can't guarantee anybody's safety. It's like to not have a fair [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3070.8s)]
*  inventory is you can't do anything. If I don't know if there's 20 cats in my house and I walk [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3077.1200000000003s)]
*  in and I have food for one cat. It goes back to your plan, right? And that's, that's all we're [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3084.88s)]
*  saying is come through the front door so we can have the inventory so we can, and that goes back [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3090.4s)]
*  to what I was talking about, going to the community. You brought up teaching. My wife's a [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3096.4s)]
*  lifelong educator, right? So this, this hits home. Let's think about some small town in the middle [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3100.2400000000002s)]
*  of America, right? Well, let's, let's talk Covington, Louisiana. Yeah. All right. What if all [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3106.88s)]
*  of a sudden a hundred Brazilian families who speak Portuguese showed up in Covington because [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3112.64s)]
*  in is the Covington school district is St. Tammany parish going to be able to have Portuguese [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3118.64s)]
*  speakers there because we have an obligation to educate those children. Maybe there's one or two [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3124.56s)]
*  that could do it. Maybe Linda green, if she was the teacher, she was good. Yeah. But, but think [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3128.64s)]
*  about Louis. Yeah, there was definitely some great ones. People from all over the world speaking all [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3133.2799999999997s)]
*  these different languages, but that those are the type of things that we have to think about. Right. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3137.12s)]
*  You tax the system. Now you have a, and now the students and the teachers in the town probably [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3141.6s)]
*  feel bad that they can't help. Right. So their morale is low. They don't know what to do. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3146.48s)]
*  Now they're like, you know, teachers are up at night, like trying to learn Portuguese online, [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3151.44s)]
*  just, and it's a nightmare. And the P in the Portuguese people are sitting there like we, [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3157.52s)]
*  they probably feel bad. They don't know what to do. It becomes a deprecating cycle. That doesn't [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3161.44s)]
*  get better. If we just don't, we just want people to come through the front door. Yeah. So we know [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3165.6s)]
*  who they are. They're invited guests. Right. And we should be, again, it goes back to the wide gates. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3169.84s)]
*  We want to invite guests. I think the charity starts at home. We need to clean up our own [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3173.76s)]
*  backyard. We've got homeless children, veterans and all that stuff. I totally agree. But we can [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3178.7200000000003s)]
*  certainly invite guests in if we can control it and know who they are, what they're, you know, [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3182.6400000000003s)]
*  what the strengths and weaknesses are, where they're going. So we can apply resources that way, [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3189.2000000000003s)]
*  because not only is it the educators, but the EMS and the first responders, something happens [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3194.6400000000003s)]
*  and they don't speak these languages, it becomes a challenge for everybody. So again, there is a, [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3199.12s)]
*  it can be fixed. It's complicated because it's people, right? If it was easy, we'd have fixed [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3205.3599999999997s)]
*  it years ago. It becomes vitriolic and political and it's complex because it's people. So that's [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3211.12s)]
*  why it's a perpetual cycle that keeps getting, the can keeps getting kicked. But we've got to figure [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3218.7999999999997s)]
*  out some way to stop the leak on the security side so we don't have mass people coming in illegally [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3224.48s)]
*  and then figure out the human side of it to bring people into the front door and invite those guests [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3231.36s)]
*  so we can, so they can be proactive. They don't want to, I don't think they just, not all, I mean, [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3238.64s)]
*  I don't want to broad brush anybody, but I think the majority of them are trying, want to do good. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3242.88s)]
*  I mean, there's still, there's going to be a good minority chunk of these people that are probably [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3247.36s)]
*  just not doing good. We've seen that in New York City, right? Recently the migrants that beat up [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3252.48s)]
*  the cops. I mean, those, I mean, that, we've got to get that- It's a bunch of dangerous Goldilocks [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3257.6s)]
*  up there just running around in the house, eating the honey, able to shoot the bears if they come in, [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3261.28s)]
*  like, you know, and they don't, it's not even their home. Like there's, well, one thing it does is, [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3268.0s)]
*  yeah, that's, yeah, this was the case, right? Yep. Brawl between migrants and police in New York's [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3275.12s)]
*  Times Square touches off backlash. A video showing a group of migrants brawling with police in Times [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3280.48s)]
*  Square has touched off a political furor and renewed debate over a longstanding New York City [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3285.84s)]
*  policy that limits cooperation between local police and federal immigration authorities. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3290.2400000000002s)]
*  So those are sanctuary city laws where you do not, certain cities will not cooperate with immigration [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3295.36s)]
*  and customs enforcement. In other words, if they, if this person tells them they're a non-US citizen, [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3301.76s)]
*  those cities have passed policy that they're on their obligation to report their immigration status [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3308.8799999999997s)]
*  to federal officials. But can they detain them or no? They won't, not because of, not for immigration [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3314.8799999999997s)]
*  status. I mean, that's the federal responsibility, but there used to be, we have what we call a [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3320.56s)]
*  detainer program and what would typically happen and what still happens in non-sanctuary cities, [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3324.72s)]
*  if they encounter somebody and they ask them, what's your citizenship? And they say, well, I'm from, [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3330.56s)]
*  you know, wherever, name a country, Mexico or Central America or Venezuela. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3335.52s)]
*  Do you have any documents that allow you to be here? No. That would be a call to federal [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3341.6s)]
*  immigration authorities. Say, hey, I've got, I've got John Doe over here, who's a illegal alien from [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3347.12s)]
*  Venezuela, and they would put a detainer on them. So ICE would come pick him up after the state [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3351.52s)]
*  crime. If they, if they weren't charged him, but he was here illegally, it's the federal immigration. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3356.8s)]
*  Those are the sanctuary city laws that have been really pushed and shoved down, you know, [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3362.56s)]
*  the past eight years and stuff. And what are the benefits of the sanctuary city laws? [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3369.92s)]
*  Here's what it comes down to. There is this idea. What are the benefits? The idea, the idea behind [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3374.16s)]
*  it is, well, they'll call, if, if the migrants are, have, are witnesses of crimes or have been [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3379.92s)]
*  a victim of crime, they won't report it to the police or cooperate if they feel that they could [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3387.52s)]
*  be deported. I see. So what they've said is you, you're not going to be turned over to immigration [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3394.48s)]
*  if you report a crime. And cause so they're not cooperating with federal immigration. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3401.52s)]
*  I think that can probably be debunked because there are, there are visas we can give people [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3405.84s)]
*  if you are a victim, if you are going to be a witness on behalf of the state, it took what was, [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3412.0s)]
*  they just politicized the whole thing. Yeah. You know? Um, well, it's also, it seemed like [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3420.16s)]
*  it's being used as a loophole. Absolutely. It's like another way of like, where somebody's like, [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3424.48s)]
*  it's set up for a good reason, but it's taken advantage of. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3430.4s)]
*  So many of our laws and policies are that way, right? Well, it's just, it's like at a certain [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3434.8s)]
*  point, if you get so taken advantage of, you have to start to adjust, um, the advantages you offer. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3438.4s)]
*  Yeah. I just, it, it, it goes for humans because at a certain point you're just, um, [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3446.08s)]
*  you've stressed yourself to, you've stressed your population and your people where they don't feel [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3452.96s)]
*  safe anymore. Um, yeah, it's, and to have people where they used to, they buy a piece of land or [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3457.92s)]
*  they buy a home, right? And they're raising a family and they can't even go to bed at night [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3465.2s)]
*  without thinking if, if there's thousands of people passing through their area and some of [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3470.24s)]
*  them are desperate, um, and there's no rep, like there's no, they're not going to face any, [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3476.3999999999996s)]
*  you don't even know if you can face any criminal charges, you don't even know who they are. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3483.9199999999996s)]
*  Right. Yeah. It's like, um, it's just very scary. It's not fair that, uh, people should have to, [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3486.48s)]
*  um, live in fear. I think we have way too much ability, you know? Um, it just breaks me. I mean, [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3492.3999999999996s)]
*  it just, you know, we send all this foreign aid. It's just, it's time to take care of this country [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3500.08s)]
*  for a while. And it feels like it's just been sold out to the highest bidder that, um, that the [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3505.2799999999997s)]
*  American dream was just auctioned off years ago. And it almost feels like we're pretending sometimes [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3512.0s)]
*  the rest of us that still believe in it. I call it the, uh, I, I don't mean to sound [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3516.88s)]
*  dour and hopeless. I'm not hopeless. There's, there is a true erosion of empathy that's happening [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3521.84s)]
*  because of all the situations around the world and right here in our border. When you are, [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3526.08s)]
*  when you are a multi-generational rancher who is, you know, putting food on the table, but now you [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3530.32s)]
*  have to be armed to take your kids to the bus stop because groups are coming in that are, that are [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3535.76s)]
*  evading arrest in certain parts and are, uh, are stealing your cars, are breaking into your homes, [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3541.2s)]
*  where a generation ago they were, Hey, can we get some food and I'll clean up your stall? I'm just [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3547.12s)]
*  trying to go look for some work. It's changed so much. So Americans shouldn't have to live in fear [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3551.8399999999997s)]
*  at the same time. The migrants shouldn't be living in fear because they're being exploited just to [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3556.24s)]
*  try to get an opportunity. And that's, that's where, you know, it gets, it kind of boils my [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3560.72s)]
*  blood when I hear all the humanitarian crisis at the border, but they're not, they're not fixing it. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3566.32s)]
*  They're just talking about it and kicking it for the next election cycle. It seems like they always [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3571.76s)]
*  do that. And that's where it gets frustrating. It's like, we need, we need to take care of the [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3575.52s)]
*  people. And by the way, the humanitarian issue is not just the migrants. It's our agents, it's our [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3579.92s)]
*  border communities. It's the people that are suffering in these sanctuary cities. I want, [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3584.88s)]
*  I don't want to leave that topic just yet because, you know, um, you hear the mayors of New York and [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3588.88s)]
*  Chicago and Denver. They're now they're crying about all this, but they were with their bullhorn [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3594.64s)]
*  a few years ago saying, we welcome everybody. And now all of a sudden they realize, Hey, this is kind [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3599.44s)]
*  of a mess. I will say this to defend mayor Adams to some extent from New York. He sent his team down [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3604.0s)]
*  to the border. Um, we met with him back in 2022 and showed them this is what's happening. This is [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3610.0s)]
*  what's going on. A lot of, there was a lot of jaws dropping like, Oh my gosh, didn't realize this. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3614.7999999999997s)]
*  So they kind of knew, but how can you not, how can you not know what's going on? I know that's [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3618.72s)]
*  what, how do you have no, like, I don't even know what's going on. And I know what's going on. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3623.76s)]
*  Daylight savings time is starting up again for most States. God, it makes me nervous because I [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3630.4s)]

*  happened in New York. I just want to go through that a little bit more. I just, I want to tap [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3764.2400000000002s)]
*  into this, um, New York issue again, real quick. The surveillance footage recorded on January 27th, [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3768.48s)]
*  outside of Manhattan homeless shelters shows several men kicking officers on a sidewalk [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3774.08s)]
*  and trying to pry them off a man. Police had taken to the ground. Police have arrested seven [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3778.6400000000003s)]
*  people in connection with the attack. The prosecutors dropped charges against one person. They say, [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3783.84s)]
*  may not have been involved. I think if you don't prosecute or eliminate or get, [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3789.04s)]
*  well, it's tough because these people are obviously in a state of desperation. They've [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3797.2000000000003s)]
*  been kind of released into a place where there's no clear path for them either, probably. So they [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3800.88s)]
*  don't know what to do. And then you've put, but the fact that they're putting the officers at risk, [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3805.84s)]
*  any of that you got to go. Did you see the video of them when they were released that day after [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3811.92s)]
*  the assault, they're walking and flipping everybody off. They don't care. So think about [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3816.56s)]
*  it. They all think they're, uh, so that right there, broad brushes, all these migrants, not all of [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3820.16s)]
*  them are that way. I mean, again, fortunately, the second you kick a fucking cop, though, dude, [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3826.88s)]
*  I think it's a bad look to the people of this country who are still trying to obey the laws [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3833.6s)]
*  that, um, and uphold them that, uh, that you don't make a point you're going. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3839.44s)]
*  Well, that's the lack of consequences, right? These people, now I don't know all their story, [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3846.16s)]
*  but I know they were, they were processed and released and went to New York. Um, these people, [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3851.52s)]
*  um, have been, I don't give a fuck who these people are. Get them the fuck out. To be honest [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3858.0s)]
*  with you. This is the, this is what we're talking about, right? This there. Yeah. This is him. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3863.6s)]
*  This is the guy right there, dude, let that motherfucker loose around song. Strictly [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3867.92s)]
*  shit out of that. This is what a heartbeat, this is what pisses off the border patrol agents, [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3872.48s)]
*  because we've had to process and release these types of people. And this is what they end up [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3876.16s)]
*  doing. Right? This is, this is not beat the horse shot out of that motherfucker right there. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3880.8s)]
*  To be honest with you. I just don't like it, man. That shit is sick right there. We've got a sick [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3885.44s)]
*  way to behave, man. And I don't mean that against anybody. Like I have countless Mexican friends and [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3889.36s)]
*  all kinds of shit. I don't need to justify myself, but it just, there's a total lack of respect. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3894.32s)]
*  And when we don't show any respect for ourselves, it is after a while, um, people just, there's a [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3900.0s)]
*  lack of respect that's going to keep coming, man. It's like you're attracting it in a way. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3906.6400000000003s)]
*  Well, you know, the profession, the law enforcement profession has taken a hit over the last few [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3910.1600000000003s)]
*  years, right, wrong or otherwise from different incidents that have taken place. But right there, [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3914.48s)]
*  when you see that and you look at it and go, this is why some of the cops ended up acting the way [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3918.88s)]
*  they do. Or they just don't end up responding because it's like, why do I want to go get in [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3924.8s)]
*  this mess right here? I mean, it literally took cops being assaulted, these people being released, [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3929.92s)]
*  flipping off the cameras for it to gain enough attention to where people said, okay, this is [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3935.6000000000004s)]
*  enough. You know, it shouldn't get to that. Well, it's cause the media, finally these people are in [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3940.88s)]
*  New York, causing some trouble. That's what I say a lot. If you're going to go to a, go into a, [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3945.44s)]
*  the high, the richest neighborhood, those, that's the guy you gotta go. You're down here battling [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3952.7200000000003s)]
*  in the fricking trenches. That's the dude. Then you want to, then, then some things would be [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3958.0s)]
*  adjusted. That's the old, not my backyard mindset. Like, Hey, it's fine until you bring it to my [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3962.16s)]
*  backyard. Right. And now I think it's, well, I think now it's ending up in, in New York city, [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3966.8s)]
*  it's ending up in backyards where people are noticing it. But also the media is extremely, [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3971.36s)]
*  it's all one group and they, they don't want to show the truth. They want to live in this [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3977.6s)]
*  fictional world that, that doesn't create reality. I don't think a lot of times reflect reality. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3983.92s)]
*  Yeah. So this, this, the, the, the busing of the migrants, right? So I hate the fact that we had [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3990.2400000000002s)]
*  to get to that. Yeah, that's a big thing. So you see this a lot, right? So people, [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=3995.28s)]
*  um, but I don't blame them. I mean, I don't blame these governors, right? Again, I hate the fact [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4000.32s)]
*  that we're there. They, we had to do that. That's because of failed policies coming out of Washington [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4005.2000000000003s)]
*  and these States have said enough's enough, right? So let's back up real quick. Okay. Let's get to [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4010.0800000000004s)]
*  that. Yeah. Um, I want to, we spoke to a border patrol agent a few years ago, uh, Roy Villarreal, [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4015.92s)]
*  chief. I know Roy. Yes. Yeah. Amazing guy. And really, I mean, just awesome guy. And, um, [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4022.5600000000004s)]
*  he was saying that one of the issues was then that the legislative part was the issue because [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4029.76s)]
*  they were doing the paperwork on guys, but they weren't, no, no one was really being prosecuted. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4037.84s)]
*  People were being re-released. And so then it was just, you were constantly arresting some of the [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4042.5600000000004s)]
*  same people. Like, what is the problem that you're saying now that like, what are the problems that [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4046.7200000000003s)]
*  are holding up the border patrol from doing their job effectively? So it's a combination of things, [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4052.96s)]
*  right? So number one, and I think this is, this is great, great question. And it's really important. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4059.52s)]
*  And, and, and let's talk about the requirements that agents need to do their job. Right. Okay. So [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4064.72s)]
*  every administration, and I just remember I had mentioned earlier, I started under Clint, [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4070.96s)]
*  every administration had leaned forward on border security. Clinton brought people on board, [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4074.32s)]
*  hired more people. Um, we had the tragic of nine 11 and that addressed, uh, illegal immigration [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4080.32s)]
*  and border security. So president Bush started building infrastructure and access roads. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4086.0s)]
*  Obama built a lot of wall, 15 foot wall. Trump comes in and says, Hey, we, we're candidate Trump [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4090.8s)]
*  was build the wall, right? President Trump's, Hey, we're going to build the wall, but candidate [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4099.6s)]
*  Trump candidate when he was candidate, when he was running for president, he was build the wall. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4105.44s)]
*  That was a campaign slogan. When he became president, he's like, we're going to do this. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4109.76s)]
*  Building the wall was so much more than the actual wall. It was years, multiple administrations of [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4114.56s)]
*  requirements that agents have said we need that wall that president Trump built was not only was [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4121.92s)]
*  it a 30 foot steel wall where it made sense, it was cameras. It was lights. It was sensors. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4128.08s)]
*  It was access roads. There are so many places on the border that mother nature will through a monsoon [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4135.360000000001s)]
*  storm season will wash away and you can't even drive to the border. So we needed all weather [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4141.6s)]
*  roads. That was the wall system. Right. There was so much more. There were places where agents could [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4146.4800000000005s)]
*  stop the place where they could sleep, get rest. There was, it was so much to that, right? Right. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4154.160000000001s)]
*  The wall, it was the talking point. The system was what was important to us. We didn't need a wall [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4159.68s)]
*  from the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific ocean. Where we needed it was in the urban. So the [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4165.92s)]
*  border patrol has decided through our requirements and our experience that there are three operating [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4172.32s)]
*  environments, urban, where the vanishing point is seconds to minutes. Like literally if they cross, [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4177.84s)]
*  they can disappear. El Paso is a great example. They can, a hundred yards, they're in a neighborhood, [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4182.56s)]
*  they're in a high school, they're in downtown. You get into rural areas, it's hours to, it's minutes [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4187.4400000000005s)]
*  to hours they can disappear. And then you get in the remote areas, it's literally days to weeks [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4193.12s)]
*  they can disappear because the, it's, you know, a hundred mile trek through the desert. So where it [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4197.68s)]
*  made sense, we built the wall based on agents required, not just all the chiefs requirement. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4202.48s)]
*  It was what do you need agents to do your job? Sir, we need more wall here, a double wall here. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4208.64s)]
*  We need cameras. So we built that package and that, that package was being deployed and was [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4213.12s)]
*  being effective. As I mentioned, the numbers you combine that with consequences through policy, [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4220.16s)]
*  detaining people, prosecuting people that took those numbers from 900,000 to 400,000. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4225.599999999999s)]
*  But by a stroke of several pins under this administration, the wall was stopped. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4231.44s)]
*  The migrant protection protocol was turned off. This administration halted all deportations for [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4238.24s)]
*  no less than 100 days, which means nobody was being removed. Is that true? What you're saying? [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4245.04s)]
*  Yes. That's all look it all up. It's all executive orders. Biden's election. The foreign born [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4248.88s)]
*  population has grown spectacularly in millions. Yeah. I see. Yeah. There are, there are places [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4253.6s)]
*  on the border right now, Theo, where you can drive and see 30 foot wall and then a quarter mile gap [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4261.52s)]
*  with stacks of steel right there. That was just left there. Some of it's being sold off for [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4267.68s)]
*  salvage. Now our agents had to drive by spools of fiber optic cable with a trench, but we couldn't [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4271.04s)]
*  deploy it because when they signed up, when they ended that wall, it was the system, the whole [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4277.2s)]
*  package there's right there. That's how much did that hurt morale down there? Do you feel like? [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4281.2s)]
*  So that's, that was the big kicker. We actually had a, um, cause these are human, these are our [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4285.76s)]
*  agents. It's like, why don't you care about the people who are doing a real job to keep you safe? [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4290.4s)]
*  It's so sick in this country, how they don't care about people who are really fucking [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4296.48s)]
*  doing a real job, man. So without border security, every town becomes a border town. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4300.5599999999995s)]
*  Every state becomes a border state because we can't, it doesn't stop at the border. They're [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4305.52s)]
*  not all hanging out in Yuma. They're not all hanging out in Tucson, but they're coming to [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4309.6s)]
*  Nashville. They're coming around and people are seeing that you talked about the morale. We went [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4313.52s)]
*  from an administration, the Trump administration who championed board of Troids, who had them at [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4318.88s)]
*  the state of a union, had him at his inauguration parade. Now Obama had done a lot. You said to [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4325.68s)]
*  Obama had, so let's, let's talk about Obama on that one because if you remember going into his [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4330.48s)]
*  second term, he wanted comprehensive immigration reform, the DACA, which is the deferred action [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4337.12s)]
*  against childhood arrivals, which I don't think anybody disagrees with. If you're an adult and [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4342.08s)]
*  you bring your one-year-old kid over and that kid has stayed here all his life or her life and they're [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4345.839999999999s)]
*  graduated high school, you're going to deport them because they're not, you know, that's what DACA was [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4351.2s)]
*  for, right? That makes sense. No one's going to boot that kid. All this kid knows is [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4355.679999999999s)]
*  American life, right? As long as he's not a criminal and doing bad things and trying to contribute, [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4360.08s)]
*  let them stay. But there was the issue also, but there was also those, another thing that he did [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4365.44s)]
*  where it was like, he did DAPA, which was on the like parents, like you could bring your now you [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4370.0s)]
*  could bring your parents in. So what happened was he wanted comprehensive immigration reform. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4375.5199999999995s)]
*  The Republicans said, well, we border security first. So he said, okay, I'll give you border [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4382.08s)]
*  security if you give me immigration reform. So they went to, he went to bat and started [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4385.52s)]
*  removing people. He had a lot of deportations on their bomb. He built a lot of wall. And then [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4391.52s)]
*  in typical political fashion, they argued over the definition of border control, [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4398.160000000001s)]
*  operational control of the border. And so the left and the right started the political football [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4402.72s)]
*  back and forth. What does control mean? What's an effective level of control? Obama said, okay, [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4408.160000000001s)]
*  enough's enough. I'm just going to start doing, you know, I'm going to start writing this as [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4412.32s)]
*  executive Fiat and do executive orders. And I'm going to start allowing people to stay here. I'm [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4417.04s)]
*  going to do that. And that's what he did. And that's when it kind of went, look, the Republicans at [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4420.719999999999s)]
*  that point missed an opportunity. And why, because they could have, they could have had, [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4425.92s)]
*  they could have had more border security and championed some kind of immigration reform [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4431.44s)]
*  because we hadn't had any changes in immigration law for, you know, 20 years before that. So there [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4435.92s)]
*  was an opportunity. And to Obama's credit, at least on the front end, now I don't know, [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4439.84s)]
*  I'm not going to get into all the behind the scenes stuff, but at least on the front end, [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4445.52s)]
*  he gave it the old college try. You got, I'll give you security, but you got to give me something [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4448.4800000000005s)]
*  in return. And when we've, when we argued on the definitions, semantics of it, yep. He said, fine, [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4452.88s)]
*  I'm going to do my own thing. And we're going to start letting, if you were, you know, he started [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4459.12s)]
*  doing his own executive actions and, and that, that was a pull factor. So we started seeing this [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4462.16s)]
*  huge increase of people in the, in 2012, 13 and 14 under the second term of Obama. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4467.84s)]
*  Why? Because you mean they're, they're seeing these reactions in the news and stuff like that. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4473.12s)]
*  And they're knowing, okay, now's the time. Now's the time to come. He's not going to remove you. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4476.72s)]
*  You're going to be, he's going to reunite families. He's going to do all this stuff. So people just [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4481.2s)]
*  started, that's when it all started changing was in about 2012. Remember earlier, I was telling you [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4483.92s)]
*  single adults, mainly Mexican nationals, a few central Americans in 12, 13 and 14. We started [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4492.0s)]
*  seeing this huge increase. And I'll tell you a very funny story. It's not funny, but it's, [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4498.16s)]
*  it's a true story. I'm sitting here in Washington, DC. It is believe it is mother's day week and the [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4502.16s)]
*  Friday before mother's day, 2014, we had so many people in McAllen, Texas border patrol station [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4509.28s)]
*  that it was making the headlines. And we were on the phone. It was a lot of children and families. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4517.12s)]
*  And they were just, there was literally hundreds of them in the Sally port where you bring them [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4522.72s)]
*  into the station and border patrol stations were short-term holding for single adults. They're not [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4526.4s)]
*  designed for detention, long-term detention. So you had bodies stacked everywhere sleeping in [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4531.2s)]
*  you need these, these, you know, mylar blankets and stuff. It was an ugly scene, but it was, [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4536.24s)]
*  it was the reality. It was out of control in, in, in south Texas. We were on the phone with people [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4541.5199999999995s)]
*  from department of security. I'm in border patrol headquarters in Washington and we're telling them, [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4547.04s)]
*  Hey, this is, this is getting out of control. And they said, well, let's think about what we want to [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4552.32s)]
*  do. Let's have a good weekend and we'll, we'll reconvene on Monday. And one of the guys that [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4557.44s)]
*  worked for me, he's just like, like chief, let me say that. I said, tell them, he says, if you wait [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4561.919999999999s)]
*  till Monday, you'll have a full blown, full blown crisis on your hands. Now that was Friday, [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4566.32s)]
*  Sunday, then secretary Jay Johnson rerouted his plane and went down to McAllen, Texas with his [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4573.5199999999995s)]
*  wife. It was mother's day, saw what was going on on Monday. He made a secretarial proclamation. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4579.84s)]
*  This is a, be good at all hands on deck. And then by the end of the week, the president got involved [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4586.16s)]
*  and said, we're going to do everything we can. I mean, that's how quickly, and we were catching [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4590.48s)]
*  less than 3000 a day. That's, that was 2013 and 14 3000 day was a full blown crisis. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4595.92s)]
*  Wow. And now we're at five times. Yeah. Well, so for most of last year, we [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4604.8s)]
*  hovered over 10,000 arrests a day. Right now we're sitting around 6,700 arrests. So now, [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4610.16s)]
*  so now we're twice that twice that it was a full blown crisis under Jay Johnson and vice president [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4615.12s)]
*  Biden. And fast forward, we've doubled that yet. We won't acknowledge the crisis from the white [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4622.56s)]
*  house. Now, wait a second, what happened? And then in between you had president Trump who tried to fix [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4627.84s)]
*  it and was making huge progress only be only to be kind of, you know, the, the, yeah. I mean, [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4633.04s)]
*  the media hated him. Oh yeah. Well, that was even though now some of the, the democratic policies [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4639.6s)]
*  are turning into the Republican policies. They're like coming over because at a certain point, [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4644.400000000001s)]
*  I, there's no argument against organization. There's no argument against like investing in [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4650.88s)]
*  our infrastructure and wanting to have this machine run. Well, it's like, [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4659.04s)]
*  you know, you've asked, you asked about morale and that's kind of where we were going. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4666.0s)]
*  So let's think about that. One of the biggest morale killers for us was in September of 2021 [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4669.04s)]
*  in Del Rio, Texas, the horse patrol incident that people would talk about. And you could probably [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4677.44s)]
*  bring that up. Yeah. We had a, a over 16,000 people showed up in Del Rio, Texas in a matter of like [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4681.679999999999s)]
*  three or four days. Now, now I'm over in Yuma dealing with a large number of people, but it's [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4688.799999999999s)]
*  not that many in three days. All the resources were shifted down there and our horse patrol, [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4693.12s)]
*  which is our traditional, we've started that we're going to be a hundred years old in may [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4700.08s)]
*  every agent had a horse back then. And I've ridden horses. Horses are great tools on the border. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4704.639999999999s)]
*  They work, they were keeping the chaos organized. People were going back and forth to Mexico, [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4710.24s)]
*  they were setting up vendors were setting up on Mexico, selling them tacos and food, [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4718.08s)]
*  food trucks, right? As we were trying to organize all this chaos. So this one particular subject [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4722.0s)]
*  grabbed food from this family and was running across the river. The horse patrol. And like you [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4731.360000000001s)]
*  can see in that picture comes down there to try to, you know, round him up, right? The image that [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4738.64s)]
*  was taken, the actual still photo was, you know, it was iconic. The, the horse in the river, the [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4745.6s)]
*  cowboy hat, the split reins, the migrant run. And it was a beautiful image. It was captured by the [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4753.76s)]
*  secretary, the vice president and the president as they were whipped those migrants. And the [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4760.96s)]
*  president of the United States said, I promise you, they will pay for strapping those people. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4767.12s)]
*  And he made that motion. Number one, the person that took the picture said, there's no whips. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4773.68s)]
*  Nobody was being whipped. This was, there's the image, right? That's a split rain. That's the guy [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4779.4400000000005s)]
*  controlling the horse, trying to grab this guy who just stolen stuff from people. And he's running [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4784.4800000000005s)]
*  away from the agents, right? That's an agent accosting somebody who's stealing. Yeah. So, [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4788.72s)]
*  and maybe for desperate reasons, but stealing. Well, yeah, but it was, yeah. So you're stealing [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4793.12s)]
*  lunch from a family. So that's, that's if you've ever ridden horses and you split reins, that's [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4796.8s)]
*  how you control the horse, right? So we knew all that. And, and this was something to hear the [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4800.96s)]
*  president say they will pay. Wow. I mean, I, I was a thousand, yeah, the agents are going to, [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4808.4800000000005s)]
*  they're, they're going to be in trouble for this. The cameraman said there, nobody got whipped. This [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4814.16s)]
*  was, they didn't, it was a good distraction from the chaos that was happening, right? You know, [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4818.32s)]
*  let's shift it to the bad border patrol agents, as opposed to my bad policies that allowed 16,000 [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4824.08s)]
*  people to come in in three days. You want to talk about morale killer when the, the commander in [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4829.12s)]
*  chief, the president of the United States in a country where you're innocent until proven guilty [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4834.88s)]
*  says they will pay when the facts were, they didn't whip anybody. They were doing their job and [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4839.5199999999995s)]
*  throws their own border patrol on the bus. And so, I mean, I was a thousand miles away going, [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4845.92s)]
*  Oh my gosh, my agents were just like deflated. And not only the agents, but let's think about [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4850.24s)]
*  the agent's parents and their loved ones who are going, they're down there trying to do the best [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4855.92s)]
*  they can. The president just called them out. Now, if they had done something wrong and they had beat [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4859.92s)]
*  somebody like that on camera, yeah, there's a consequence for those agents, but that was, [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4865.2s)]
*  that wasn't the case. That's somebody doing their job. It's like, at some point you have to have [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4870.24s)]
*  people do their jobs. So the morale just tanked from that. It was already tough with the flow [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4874.32s)]
*  and we expect under every administration, some kind of change. And we figured it would be a few [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4880.16s)]
*  months. We didn't realize it would be that long. Then it just compounded and got worse and worse. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4885.2s)]
*  And actually, you know, the following year, I think we had 14 border patrol agents commit suicide. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4888.88s)]
*  And we had one of them in, in Yuma. And I'm not going to say that, that it was because of the [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4895.2s)]
*  border crisis, but I could say that not being happy at work, feeling demoralized and not having [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4901.36s)]
*  a purpose is a contributing factor. I'm sure there's financial, emotional, physical issues [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4908.719999999999s)]
*  that they were dealing with, but when you can come to work where it used to be, hey, I can go out [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4913.839999999999s)]
*  there and make a difference. And now I'm being relegated to transportation and babysitting. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4917.44s)]
*  There's just no happy place for them. Right. And, and yeah, you take away somebody's purpose. And [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4922.5599999999995s)]
*  we had a great thinker in here, John Verveckian. He talks all about purpose. Right here it says [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4927.2s)]
*  between 2007 and November, 2022 CBP, is that California border patrol? No, that's Customs and [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4934.48s)]
*  Border Protection. That's our parent agency. So DHS, Customs and Border Protection, US border [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4940.88s)]
*  patrol. Okay. Customs and Border Protection has lost 149 people to suicide among the highest rates [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4946.32s)]
*  compared to other law enforcement agencies. I just don't understand why there's no support. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4951.92s)]
*  I don't understand why you have to beg for support. I don't understand why you give people a job [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4959.2s)]
*  and give them all this training, but then don't even give them the fair environment to do their [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4966.88s)]
*  job in. Right. And then look down upon them when they're doing their job, just for what? Like, [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4974.48s)]
*  I just, it's just unfortunate. And you want your law enforcement, just like you want your doctors [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4983.12s)]
*  and your teachers to have their head on straight and head in the game and not distract, at least [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4988.799999999999s)]
*  minimize all the distractions while they're doing that. Because, you know, number one, if it's a [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4994.16s)]
*  doctor, it could save your life in surgery. If it's law enforcement, it could protect you and save [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=4999.12s)]
*  your life in an event of a tragedy. And if it's a teacher, you want them to educate you so you can [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5003.92s)]
*  make your own decisions as you learn and grow. We have to support all our military and law enforcement [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5008.4s)]
*  and first responders in that mental health resiliency world because it's so important, [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5016.24s)]
*  because we need them. And we need to recruit the good people too. So we need to offer that, like, [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5021.04s)]
*  hey, not only are we going to expect you to do your job. And Theo, I'll tell you too, I'm for [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5026.88s)]
*  old school. You're going to roll your sleeves up and get the job done, but it's okay now to talk [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5032.88s)]
*  about it. Like, okay, what I'm dealing with, how I feel with that. I'm not saying we need to be soft [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5037.04s)]
*  on all this stuff because we still have a very difficult job and you've got to get dirty, but [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5041.28s)]
*  it's okay to talk about what's bothering you afterward or, hey, I wasn't a hundred percent day [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5045.92s)]
*  because of this. All right, how can I help you? We, that is okay. You know, we all grew up in the, [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5051.04s)]
*  get some dirt on it and go back in there. Right. And that's okay, but we can talk about it now. And [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5057.04s)]
*  I think that's the difference in where we evolve professionally and we grow as a leader. That's [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5061.68s)]
*  where I saw, I couldn't make policy changes under president Biden, but I could make operational [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5066.56s)]
*  changes. Say I can devote some funds to mental health and resiliency with my workforce and bring [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5072.56s)]
*  people in to champion our agents and tell them the same thing as chief. I would say something like, [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5076.88s)]
*  okay, yeah, chief, that's just box checking. You're the boss. Right. But when I bring in an NFL [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5082.8s)]
*  player to come in there and say the same thing, like you guys are heroes. Thank you for doing [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5086.88s)]
*  what you're doing. It changes their, they come to, they're happy. Like, Hey, somebody appreciates [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5091.44s)]
*  us. And so just little things like that, you know, it's cliche, but thank a cop. That's what [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5097.04s)]
*  you want to do because you want them on your side and nobody, by the way, nobody hates a bad cop more [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5101.839999999999s)]
*  than a good cop. And so we're not going to tolerate bad stuff amongst our ranks, but there are so many [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5107.599999999999s)]
*  good people out there, whether it's a board of attorney agent or a domestic law enforcement or [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5114.24s)]
*  an FBI agent, there's so many good ones doing good work. We've got to champion them because [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5118.4s)]
*  what are the alternatives if we don't complete chaos? Yeah. And I want to say that too, to people [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5123.5199999999995s)]
*  out there who are in that, in a position where you're a teacher, where you're a, you're an officer, [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5128.48s)]
*  you're a sergeant, you're a community worker that isn't, you're not rewarded as well financially as [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5135.5199999999995s)]
*  you should be by your environment, by your city or state, your country. I just want to say just, [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5142.32s)]
*  hold on, just, just thank you. And just, you know, just, just know that citizens, they feel that with [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5148.88s)]
*  you, you know, and I don't know, maybe I'm just kind of getting preachy or weird. I don't know. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5158.32s)]
*  It just makes me sad, man. It just doesn't, cause it doesn't add up. And I think people are tired of, [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5163.04s)]
*  uh, even nice people are getting like, fuck. Yeah. It's that erosion empathy, right? That we talked [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5168.56s)]
*  about. So look, we understand that we can't always pay people in their, their, their, their bank [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5174.4800000000005s)]
*  accounts more money, but we can pay them in that emotional bank account by thanking them. Oh, [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5180.88s)]
*  a hundred percent. That's important. We had some, we had a, uh, a garbage man on dude legend, bro. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5184.56s)]
*  Yeah. Um, and he said the best thing he can do go out there once in a while. Thank you garbage man. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5190.0s)]
*  He said they never even seen anybody, nobody's even awake. They're out there doing the long haul [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5197.92s)]
*  by him a sixer way knowing. Yeah. There he is right there, man. You're right. So, uh, Chris, [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5202.16s)]
*  let me ask you, I want to just before we move forward, I know like, I want to think about some [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5210.08s)]
*  of the political stuff, you know, cause you hear a lot of things, right? Like being in an election [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5214.32s)]
*  year right now, it's like, you start to see the political kickball, like you were saying, being [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5219.04s)]
*  kicked around of the border, right? It's the bit, the border, the border, immigrant, you know, [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5224.48s)]
*  you start to see a lot of that happening. And one of the things that you hear recently is that, [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5229.12s)]
*  that, uh, democratic party wants to allow people into the country to, to be able to get them to be [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5234.32s)]
*  able to vote or even, even by, by whatever means to be able to get them to become democratic voters. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5243.2s)]
*  But also I was thinking, is there a value in like the Republican side [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5250.96s)]
*  in also letting it be an issue because then they can say, Hey, this is an issue. So you have to [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5257.84s)]
*  vote this way. So, so those are two things that I hear kind of, and then I think about, um, what [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5264.72s)]
*  is that like, like, would you, is that something that border agents feel at all? Or yeah, yeah, [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5271.28s)]
*  we, we, we, we, unfortunately, we did not want to be in the limelight and, you know, not be in the [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5276.5599999999995s)]
*  political sphere, but we, we are, uh, because we're on the news all the time. So let's, let's [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5282.4s)]
*  dissect this a little bit. Um, for the democratic side, it is all about victim of the poor migrants. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5287.44s)]
*  We need to help them out. They're being exploited. We need to bring them over and give them a better [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5294.48s)]
*  life, right? That that's a feel good story, right? Now there's some truth to that. There are victims [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5297.28s)]
*  and there are people that want to, but that becomes a feel good story. The Republicans will [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5302.64s)]
*  say, Hey, look, it's a security issue. They'll talk about security. We need to save our country [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5306.96s)]
*  and secure our borders to prevent terrorism and criminal aliens and drugs and all that stuff. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5310.88s)]
*  Cause that's a real problem too. So they're both, they're both real. They just present them as false [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5315.360000000001s)]
*  choices. Like you can't have one with the out the other. And if you want one, then you're against [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5320.240000000001s)]
*  the other person. And that's, that's the divisiveness that this, this country has become is you can be [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5324.400000000001s)]
*  pro security, but still have lawful immigration. The, the other piece too is there's a, if you, [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5330.08s)]
*  if you utter this, people will say it's kind of a conspiracy, but you have to start kind of thinking [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5338.48s)]
*  about where are they going with, why would you allow upwards of 7 million people to come in here? [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5343.92s)]
*  And one theory and that people will float around is, well, not necessarily to have them vote [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5349.92s)]
*  because your only citizens are supposed to vote, but you know what? Census [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5356.8s)]
*  determines representation and ultimately electoral college numbers and things like that. So if you can [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5363.6s)]
*  flood a Texas and you take it from red to purple, you get more representatives that may vote swing [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5370.96s)]
*  to a district that could be a more Democrat. I see. So if you feel like your party could [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5380.96s)]
*  influence to get more electoral votes or representatives or representatives. So if you [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5385.76s)]
*  feel like your party could get more representatives because there's a larger population in that area [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5391.76s)]
*  and you feel like you got the, the, the, the ability to get more players in the game, [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5397.200000000001s)]
*  then you're going to be pro that that, that, that is a, that is like without the truth, [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5401.6s)]
*  without somebody saying, well, here's why we're letting 7 million people in. You kind of start [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5406.96s)]
*  floating these ideas. And I'm not saying that that's the case, but if you, if you look at it, [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5410.96s)]
*  if you have a state that is split 50 50, when it comes down to Republicans and, and Democratic [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5415.04s)]
*  elected representatives, but you can put in five more million people into that state. And the next [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5422.96s)]
*  time they redistrict or do a census and, and okay, well you get to increase the number of [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5430.72s)]
*  representatives and it's leaning one direction or the other. You're going to lock it. Yeah. And look [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5435.6s)]
*  how close the house is right now. One extra or two extra Democratic officials now on that, on the [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5440.08s)]
*  house swings everything to the party of power. So there that, I mean, again, without somebody telling [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5447.76s)]
*  you, Hey, why are you letting all these people in? Why are you bogging the system down? Someone [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5454.24s)]
*  floats that idea. It's like, well, not, I mean, if that's the truth, it's evil genius. Great. At [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5460.4s)]
*  least we know now we can work the devil, you know, versus the devil, you don't know, right? [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5465.68s)]
*  And that's cause, cause I, for the life of me, I can't make heads or tails of why this would [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5470.08s)]
*  happen. Right? So as an agent, you're like, these people should be given a hearing and removed [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5476.8s)]
*  because they're not going to meet the merit. Instead we let them go and we house them. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5482.320000000001s)]
*  But then it's about control because then it's about a sickening few people with such control. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5486.64s)]
*  Like where's the value in that as a human being, it's like the people that are controlling shit [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5493.2s)]
*  have no, do they have any fucking feeling? I'm just like, what is even going on? I think [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5500.4s)]
*  this, why would you let all of these people suffer? Not only the people who are being, [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5505.5199999999995s)]
*  um, who are, don't, don't have a clear path to, uh, to asylum or to residency or to comfort or [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5509.44s)]
*  to peace. They're not in peace either. If they're having to sleep hiding behind something to not get [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5517.28s)]
*  arrested all the time, you know, like, and also the families and people who are just, um, citizens [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5522.8s)]
*  of the country. It just, first of all, my wife tells me this a lot, clear as kind. We need to clear, [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5529.52s)]
*  send a clear message that, you know, and, and so if somebody's sitting here for seven years before [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5536.0s)]
*  they get their first hearing, that's not clear. Yeah. They don't know what the results are going [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5542.64s)]
*  to be. They don't know if they're going to get to stay. They don't know if they were going to get a [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5547.04s)]
*  work permit. That is not very kind, right? No, it's not. And then I also, to your point about [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5550.0s)]
*  this sick demented, whoever's pulling the strings here, they want servants over citizens. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5555.36s)]
*  Cause you know what? Citizens will stand up eventually. We will speak our mind, [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5561.76s)]
*  but if I can bring you in and give you handouts and control you, you are going to be my servant [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5566.08s)]
*  and you will do what I tell you to do. I mean, again, I don't want to be a tin foil hat wearing [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5571.36s)]
*  person, but without the facts, without somebody telling me what the plan is, [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5575.68s)]
*  you start inserting these things and some of it kind of starts making sense because you can [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5580.320000000001s)]
*  lean things. You can control things if you have a bunch of servants. Well, it's where conspiracy [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5584.64s)]
*  theories really, that's how it starts. I was talking about this with a friend yesterday. It was like, [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5589.6s)]
*  well, when the news got bad and got not news and it was just like, uh, the news was just trying to [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5594.56s)]
*  say what it wanted to say and not just give the facts. That's when conspiracy theories [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5603.68s)]
*  start because people have to make sense of things. So it's your brain's, your brain is only function [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5609.2s)]
*  is to organize and to make sense of things. That's all it's supposed to do. And so a lot [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5616.0s)]
*  of conspiracy theories, it's like, it's, it's, it's just not adding up. It's yeah. When things don't add [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5622.24s)]
*  up, you have to, the equation needs to make sense. So that's only reason why you, a conspiracy [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5629.04s)]
*  theory even gets created is to make things make sense. And when things aren't making sense anymore, [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5634.4s)]
*  then the conspiracy theories could be what does make sense. And oftentimes these days it is. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5639.12s)]
*  Yeah. And then they say, or is just still that back at you. Well, they don't know what they're [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5643.92s)]
*  talking about. They're a conspiracy. Well, no one in one is two. It's not three and it's not adding [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5646.4s)]
*  up to two. So what's the deal here? You know, um, you know, it's, it is kind of crazy cause we've [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5650.72s)]
*  seen such an evolution of, of, you know, what's happened at the border, right? Um, I've talked [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5656.72s)]
*  about that and, and, and, you know, there's solutions out there. It's just, it's, you know, [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5663.6s)]
*  we just gotta be able to, I like to say, get the extreme left and the extreme right, take extreme [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5667.84s)]
*  recess and get some common sense in the middle, right? To start coming up with some solutions. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5672.320000000001s)]
*  And well, and they're not doing it. I mean, they just had the, uh, my Yorkist guy. Um, who was the, [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5676.320000000001s)]
*  he was the secretary, just got impeached. Yeah. He just got impeached, but that was impeached [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5682.4800000000005s)]
*  by the house of representatives, right? Right. Which is only it, the Senate's not going to pass [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5686.56s)]
*  that. So he's not really going to be impeached. No, it's just, it's just like president Trump, [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5691.6s)]
*  just like president Clinton, they were impeached in the process, but they weren't convicted. So [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5695.120000000001s)]
*  they're not removed. And so yeah, it's a, right. You know, we've given up the American public has [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5698.96s)]
*  almost given up on all of this charades of bullshit because you can't even follow it. Homeland [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5703.4400000000005s)]
*  security secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas has been impeached by the house of representatives. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5708.080000000001s)]
*  A cabinet secretary has not been impeached by the U S Congress since 1876. The office of Senate [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5712.88s)]
*  majority leader, Chuck Schumer, who is the worst, I think said, my Orcas impeachment trial will begin [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5720.56s)]
*  later this month. So this is just going to be a whole big hoop raw process, man. And it probably [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5727.36s)]
*  will not happen unless they need to have a Patsy to make it look like they're going to do something [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5733.52s)]
*  different. Yeah. So, I mean, you can have the trial and it's still going to require two thirds [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5739.2s)]
*  of the Senate to, so that would be everybody on the Republican side and half of the Democrats saying [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5742.88s)]
*  he's convicted. Right. And that's not likely to happen if this even happens. And it's easy to say [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5748.5599999999995s)]
*  it's likely to begin in a month, but you've got all these other world events happening. You know, [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5754.4s)]
*  it, again, it's, um, that's the politics of it, you know, and this is a classic example of, of, uh, [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5758.72s)]
*  of an election cycle last go around. They ran on going to impeach the guy. It took two years for [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5765.2s)]
*  them to finally do it. Um, and did it change anything? No, it, you know, nothing. And they [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5769.28s)]
*  ran on the Russia shit. I just, it's, it's, I'm okay with letting people make their own choice. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5774.8s)]
*  Right. Um, people are, you would think people can get a sense and trust their instincts and find a [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5781.12s)]
*  leader that has enough of their commonalities, things that they believe in. Right. Um, I don't [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5788.72s)]
*  think I ever fall into like identity politics where I'm going to vote for somebody just because [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5794.8s)]
*  they're a one party or this party. I've voted for people from both parties. Um, back to choices, [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5798.96s)]
*  think about everybody wants choices until it comes to politics. Then they, they, they forced [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5805.28s)]
*  their, their choice on you. Yeah. We want it. We want to be pro choice in all things in life. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5811.04s)]
*  Right. We want to have options. Doesn't matter what, what those options are, but we should have [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5815.28s)]
*  options. Right. Then it comes to politics. Oh no, you can't have a choice. You back to the [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5820.56s)]
*  political, the politicalization of the border. I tell you, I had so many congressional delegations [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5825.92s)]
*  under president Trump. I couldn't, I was the deputy chief and El Paso number two, [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5831.4400000000005s)]
*  the congressional delegation. That is where a group of congressional members, [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5835.280000000001s)]
*  representatives will come down, uh, and they want to hear and learn. It's a, it's a field trip for [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5838.96s)]
*  them. Right. Sometimes their caucuses like Hispanic caucus or a border security caucus or, you know, [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5843.84s)]
*  African American caucus, they'll, they'll, they'll be a group of like-minded, mainly usually one [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5849.04s)]
*  party. They go down there and they, they want to hear what's happening. Um, oftentimes it's [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5853.84s)]
*  oversight committees will go down there under president Trump in El Paso. I kid you not, [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5859.04s)]
*  I couldn't turn around without tripping over a congressional delegation wanting to point the [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5864.48s)]
*  finger at big bad Trump and what he was doing and all the people that was when the AOC was said, [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5868.08s)]
*  they were drinking out of the toilet. All that kind of stuff was when I was there in El Paso, [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5873.68s)]
*  completely ridiculous. But you know what? Under this administration, when I was the chief in, [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5877.36s)]
*  in Yuma, I had two Democrats come down to the border. One was a Democrat. Um, he was, he came [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5883.44s)]
*  down, but, but he was, uh, I had, uh, uh, Mark Kelly, the Senator from Arizona who worked with [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5890.08s)]
*  me to try to fill some border gaps. So he, we, it took us 18 months, but we finally got something [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5895.28s)]
*  done. And I had, uh, Gary Johnson out of the, uh, Homeland security committee, uh, Senator Johnson [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5900.0s)]
*  from, um, from Michigan, only two Democrat sitting representatives that came down to the border, [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5904.96s)]
*  a lot of Republicans, but they did, they wanted to ignore the problem. I had some phone calls from, [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5910.08s)]
*  uh, Senator Sinema, um, but never came down there to meet with me. Only two, but when it was president [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5916.32s)]
*  Trump, I had hundreds of people coming. So why aren't more coming even just because it's one [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5923.84s)]
*  president or the other that shouldn't determine why one is because one side doesn't want to talk [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5929.6s)]
*  about the problem. The other side wants to blame the problem. So under Trump coming down to blame, [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5934.56s)]
*  just like the Republicans come down there now to point the finger at the Biden ministry. So it [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5940.080000000001s)]
*  becomes, so we have to, we have to, right. That's what I was saying. It's like the Republicans also, [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5945.04s)]
*  part of them is happy that it's open because they can say, look, this is, this is the problem. So [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5949.4400000000005s)]
*  it gives them also, there's quite, there's, there's a handful in every party that really want to try [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5954.88s)]
*  to solve this, but unfortunately they're, they're the minority piece, right? There's people that [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5960.8s)]
*  just don't want to deal with it. Right. Part of it too, when it comes political is it's, it goes [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5966.400000000001s)]
*  back to that victim bogeyman thing. I can run on the emotions every two years as a congressional [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5971.92s)]
*  representative, the Senate's every six years, but as a congressman or woman, I can say, [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5977.360000000001s)]
*  if they would have just voted for my bill, we would have solved this. But if you elect me next time, [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5982.400000000001s)]
*  we'll get it done. And think about this has been going, we've been talking about this since 9 11, [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5987.28s)]
*  23 years, we've been cooking border security, immigration controls in the forefront and we [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5992.96s)]
*  still can, and it's the worst it's ever been. It's the worst it's ever been right now. Yes. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=5999.92s)]
*  It's the worst it's ever been. And we've been talking about it. Now let's, let's be clear. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6005.759999999999s)]
*  9 11 was the worst, right? That was a separate event, but that triggered us talking about [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6010.96s)]
*  securing our border for 21 years or 23 years. Now do they even have TSA at the border? [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6016.32s)]
*  So they're at the, they're at the airports, but not when you're walking across. No, that's us. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6022.96s)]
*  That's board patrol. We're, do if people come in illegally, do they take their shoes off or [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6026.799999999999s)]
*  anything like that or no. So, so well, look, if they, if board patrols encounter, you've come in [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6030.96s)]
*  illegally, we're, we're arresting you. We take, we do all, we take, we take, we check everything. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6035.28s)]
*  Oh, I see. Yeah. So there's either people that are, that are legal that are coming in and they are [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6039.759999999999s)]
*  probably doing their paperwork and all that. Yeah. So, so yeah. So if you come into the airport, [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6043.68s)]
*  then you're going to be dealing, you know, if you're TSA deals with, right. And domestic stuff [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6047.76s)]
*  international, that's the custom side of things. When you come in through an airport or through a [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6053.120000000001s)]
*  port of venture, they're going to, they're going to inspect you and you know, everybody's subject [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6057.200000000001s)]
*  to an inspection. When you come in, when you come in illegally, you're arrested. Okay. And then [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6060.56s)]
*  you go through it, just like if you were arrested in downtown, they're going to take you in, they're [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6065.92s)]
*  going to patch it down. They're going to go through your stuff. They're going to inventory your [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6069.52s)]
*  property and all that kind of stuff. We do the same thing at the border, which is a challenge [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6071.6s)]
*  when you're arresting 2.2 million people every year and there's no place to put you. What percentage [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6075.200000000001s)]
*  of people get arrested and sent back? That's very few right now. The ones that get returned back [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6079.4400000000005s)]
*  immediately are going to be Mexican nationals because the continuous country, right. They're [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6087.04s)]
*  going to send them right back. There are some, oh, they're just, man, 95% of the people I caught [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6091.4400000000005s)]
*  in Yuma were caught and released. And just into America. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know, let's, [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6099.92s)]
*  let's, you know, let's talk about a couple of things. You just let, yeah, here's, here's, [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6105.76s)]
*  here's, here's a very important piece, right? You've heard this about, you've heard the term [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6110.0s)]
*  vetting. They're not properly vetted or, you know, they're being released without vetting. Well, [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6113.76s)]
*  let's, let's let you and the, and the audience know. So anytime somebody is arrested by a board [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6118.4s)]
*  patrol, we are taking their biometric data. We are fingerprinting them. We are photographing them. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6123.68s)]
*  As long as they are 14 years and older, there's laws from tender age minors. Okay. The problem [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6128.16s)]
*  with that is the record checks are only based on information that we have. So if you are a serial [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6136.16s)]
*  killer in New Guinea and you've never been caught and we don't, there's no system of record, [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6143.76s)]
*  we're not going to know who you are. We're going to take your fingerprints and photograph and say, [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6151.2s)]
*  there's no, no immigration or no criminal history, excuse me, no criminal history in the United [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6155.12s)]
*  States. We have no place to hold him. So he's going to be processed and released, but meanwhile, [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6158.96s)]
*  he can go about his business. That you can't check with another country to see if they don't have the [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6164.0s)]
*  data in our system. That's, that's the problem. The process, the agents go through perfect. You, [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6168.0s)]
*  every, no one gets released or everybody that gets arrested gets the data taken. But if there's [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6174.0s)]
*  nothing in the system, cause we don't have a relationship with our country that was, [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6180.24s)]
*  that goes back to the Obama and Trump travel bans. The reason why there was a travel ban [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6184.88s)]
*  on those countries, they did not have a vetted system of record for us to make compare notes [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6189.84s)]
*  to see if these people are good or bad. So if you are from a country, if unless you're like in some [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6195.92s)]
*  kind of Interpol record that matches with us, if you've never committed a crime in the United States, [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6201.599999999999s)]
*  we're not going to know who you are. So you could be an MS 13 gang member that has no [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6207.92s)]
*  visible tattoos that we can see in another country and never been arrested United States and not in [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6212.8s)]
*  some kind of Interpol database. We could theoretically release you. That's why detention [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6218.4s)]
*  is so critical. So we can hold onto them to make sure on no uncertain terms that who this person is, [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6225.36s)]
*  what's their intentions, what's their background, who are their sponsors, where are they going to go? [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6234.8s)]
*  That's why holding people and doing all the extra checks is so important. And by the way, [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6241.52s)]
*  the databases and systems are only as good as the databases and said, go garbage in, garbage out. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6248.0s)]
*  Sometimes there's delays, sometimes there's a system upgrade. And when I ran your check today, [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6253.52s)]
*  it came back clear. I released you two days later. It came back as a hit. Well, we released that guy. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6258.96s)]
*  So that's why we have to detain folks for that. The process is to detain them until they see the [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6264.4s)]
*  judge. But that's never going to happen. Pipes are clogged. There's way too many people in line. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6272.16s)]
*  When you release someone, right? You release them back into America. What do they have to do then? [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6277.28s)]
*  It's great. You're going to love this. So we process them and they get a, [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6284.0s)]
*  they have to check in when they, within 30 days of their, or where they said they're going. So if I [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6288.4800000000005s)]
*  catch somebody, somebody caught somebody in Yuma today, they're said they're going to Nashville. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6294.56s)]
*  We would give them the information for ICE here in Nashville. Okay. So when they arrive in Nashville, [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6298.64s)]
*  they're supposed to call and check in and say, Hey, I'm John Doe. I'm supposed to report to you. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6306.400000000001s)]
*  And there's that. There's also some ankle brace that monitoring is out. They'll put on so we can [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6311.12s)]
*  track and follow, but that's it's, it's basically on the honor system. And, and we don't have the [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6315.84s)]
*  ability to vet that location where you're going. There are places where you'll find 200 people [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6324.48s)]
*  using the same address, but here's another kicker for everybody. Cause you know, we're all paying [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6329.599999999999s)]
*  the price of the pumps, the gas, the, the grocery table everywhere else. I was spending close to [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6333.599999999999s)]
*  just over $400,000 a day in my soft sided migrant processing facility with medical, [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6340.8s)]
*  food, laundry, and migrant care services. Migrant care was really the miners. So if [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6350.8s)]
*  they were children, we had, it wasn't agents having to babysit anymore. We actually hired people [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6357.12s)]
*  to do that. That was 400 plus thousand dollars a day. There was six other Southwest border [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6361.360000000001s)]
*  sectors or six total South that was kind of using the same model. So two and a half million dollars [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6367.44s)]
*  on them. The math not to quit, but when we pro they'd be in our care for maybe two to three days [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6372.48s)]
*  and then we'd release them. We don't release them to the street necessarily. We release them to a [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6377.599999999999s)]
*  non-government organization who will take them in and then they will help facilitate to if they want [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6382.0s)]
*  to go to Nashville. Would you have a plane ticket? Do you have the means to get there? If you don't, [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6387.04s)]
*  we'll help you get there. If you do, then we'll get you on a bus to sky Harbor and you can fly. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6390.96s)]
*  Those organizations are getting reimbursed dollar for dollar from FEMA through DHS grants. So, [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6395.36s)]
*  so now we're paying for the shelter and processing facility. You guys are paying for it up front. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6402.96s)]
*  And then you're paying for the non-government organization is getting so, so the non-government [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6407.28s)]
*  organization is a nonprofit. Yes, it's, but it's getting reimbursed for the monies they spend by [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6411.68s)]
*  the government. So the government's paid twice now. Oh, and by the way, the sanctuary cities [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6416.24s)]
*  sanctuary cities said, Hey, we need $5 billion to handle these migrants that are being dropped off. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6421.2s)]
*  So in theory, in theory we could be paying for the majority of those migrants up to three times. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6427.679999999999s)]
*  So it's a money laundering. It's basically little Ukraine in America. I mean, so, so when you're [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6433.04s)]
*  looking at the cost now, remember a couple of years ago, former speaker Pelosi said that we [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6437.76s)]
*  didn't have the money to build a wall, but the States have now said we want $5 billion. We wanted [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6442.0s)]
*  $5 billion to finish the Trump wall. Who just sent a hundred billion to another country. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6447.68s)]
*  Again, charity should start home, right? We need, yes, it's just fucking unbelievable. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6453.04s)]
*  And here's the saddest part is Chris, is that it feels like as a per as a voter, [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6458.16s)]
*  it doesn't even matter anymore. That's the part that starts to feel like this does it. Like what [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6463.76s)]
*  has to happen where these sick people, here's an article right here, the Biden administration and [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6470.88s)]
*  the U S Congress have directed more than $75 billion in assistance to Ukraine, [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6476.16s)]
*  which includes humanitarian financial military support. And I wonder where all that money's [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6481.36s)]
*  going. There's no, I don't believe this war doesn't even seem like it's, it's no one's talking about [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6487.36s)]
*  it. Right. It's a facade. All we're talking about is the money being spent over there. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6492.5599999999995s)]
*  It's a Zelensky. It, I believe it is a money laundering. So, you know, it's so crazy about [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6497.44s)]
*  that with the number you threw out and what I was talking about as far as how much we're spending. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6503.36s)]
*  And a spirit laundering by the Ukraine of the Ukrainian and Russian people. I think they're [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6508.08s)]
*  being laundered in most, uh, mentally, not that I'm in favor of paying off people's student debt, [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6512.0s)]
*  but if we, if we just focused a little bit of energy here in the United States [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6519.839999999999s)]
*  with the money that we were spending everywhere else, and I get it, we have to invest around the [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6525.36s)]
*  world. I'm not saying not do that, but not to the same, we could help people. My other problem I [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6529.36s)]
*  have is the homelessness and the mental health issues we have facing this country. What would [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6534.24s)]
*  $75 billion do right now to help the homelessness and the homeless veteran problem and the mental [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6539.04s)]
*  health issues and the addicted and the, what would that, it would be a life and game changer. [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6545.04s)]
*  Yeah. Meanwhile, we're just printing money to go someplace else, but the ones that should matter [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6551.04s)]
*  the most, the American people, the people within our borders are suffering for that. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6554.96s)]
*  And it's frustrating. It is frustrating, but here's also why it's frustrating [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6558.96s)]
*  because it's not like I want to say that, Hey, we're fortunate enough. We shouldn't help other [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6563.04s)]
*  people. I don't believe that. I believe that if someone is in a sense place of power or [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6567.84s)]
*  possibility, they should do what they can to share it. Right. But I believe that you are killing the [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6575.84s)]
*  very people you're killing the spirit of the people who do that work by making them feel [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6582.64s)]
*  unsupported, by making them feel like their country doesn't have any tradition, that it doesn't have [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6590.56s)]
*  any purpose, that the borders that people died to protect don't even matter. You're killing the will [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6598.400000000001s)]
*  and the spirit of the people that are going to do that. That outreach and work. And so you're [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6606.08s)]
*  going to get to a place. Yes. We're like, you're saying you just have servants that, that if they [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6614.8s)]
*  even want to do that, as opposed to spirited American people that want to help others. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6620.32s)]
*  I'm with you and I don't want to keep saying it, but it goes back to that erosion of empathy [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6628.24s)]
*  and not only empathy, but just the spirit. Like you said, the, to roll up the sleeves and get [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6632.72s)]
*  job done and go to work and, and, and, and fight for what's right. You just kind of numb them. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6636.88s)]
*  And that's what I think that's what the plan is. Right. If we can, we can create that servant [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6642.4800000000005s)]
*  mentality where like, all right, fine. I'm just, I can't beat them. Join them. And that's not what [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6646.08s)]
*  we were founded on. Right. I mean, no, it's not. But it's a bill of goods that people are starting [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6650.16s)]
*  to think that they were sold. That's not real. And that's why I think people, that's why I think [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6654.240000000001s)]
*  you start to have to start voting for people that have some real morals and ethics you have to [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6657.68s)]
*  re and some ethos, you know, I think you gotta start voting for those people who believe that. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6663.76s)]
*  Yeah. Cause if you don't take care of this, there's nothing for this. Can't do anything. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6669.200000000001s)]
*  Right. If you don't water a plant, nobody can see it or smell it or, or enjoy it, you know, [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6672.96s)]
*  and it can't be a part of growth. Um, no, you're, you're exactly right. I think that that's so [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6678.56s)]
*  and powerful, uh, or so powerful to, to again, you know, to have just a moral compass and [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6684.32s)]
*  azimuth set for the right. It doesn't mean it's we're going to agree, but it's, it's [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6691.36s)]
*  rooted in, in good faith, right? Just, and that's the, and that's the problem. And we become, [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6695.36s)]
*  we become so addicted to, uh, you know, just, uh, immediate response or some kind of a, a, a, [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6700.8s)]
*  a licit of a response that we were not putting in the work anymore. You know, it takes a little bit [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6707.12s)]
*  of effort to do that. It's if it was easy, we wouldn't be in this problem. It's, it takes hard [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6712.16s)]
*  work. Um, and, and just like our, are the men and women in the border patrol, you know, I go back to [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6716.72s)]
*  that was my wheelhouse for in my life for 27 and a half years out there walking in the desert in 120 [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6721.92s)]
*  degree heat, climbing up in the mountains when it's, you know, sub zero temperatures, sludging [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6729.68s)]
*  through the snow on the Northern border, uh, going through, you know, uh, uh, [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6735.28s)]
*  through rattlesnake infested desert out there to track somebody one more mile because number one, [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6740.4s)]
*  you either, you may rescue somebody or you may have gotten a, a, a drug runner or you may have [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6746.5599999999995s)]
*  gotten a potential terrorist, but if you just didn't put in the work, they're going to get away [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6752.32s)]
*  and they could cause harm. And that's what, you know, what I love about what was my profession [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6756.32s)]
*  for a better part of my life was it wasn't easy. It was rewarding and it was hard work, [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6762.32s)]
*  but at the end of the day, the scars, the limps and all that stuff was worth it because of the [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6769.28s)]
*  camaraderie and the sprit of core that we had, cause we were doing something good and, and it's, [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6774.4s)]
*  and to have that minimize and victimize and not supported is tough. We are a resilient agency. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6780.16s)]
*  The men and women of border patrol ride to the sound of gunfire. We just needed that, uh, [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6789.6s)]
*  shot in the arm every once in a while. It says, Hey, keep up the good work. We got your back. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6795.36s)]
*  And we get that from a lot of people. We just need that, you know, from a broader branch, [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6798.56s)]
*  because for all the things that are wrong for this country, in order for us to get it right, [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6803.12s)]
*  we have to protect our country, both domestically through border security and then militarily, [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6806.96s)]
*  you know, be safe, you know, around the world, cause we know that there's fires everywhere. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6812.72s)]
*  And that starts at the top. Not only in your house and every day when you go to work, [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6817.52s)]
*  but the top of the country, which is our, the white house has got to be able to establish that. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6822.96s)]
*  And we're not seeing that. And that's, I think that's, I also believe, and I, [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6827.84s)]
*  I've been around the country the last few months and continue talking about the border around the [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6831.52s)]
*  country. And I, and I'm noticing the pendulum swinging back to like, Hey, enough's enough. [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6836.240000000001s)]
*  When people are dying because of fentanyl overdoses, because it's coming through the [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6841.280000000001s)]
*  border because we won't shut it down from China and from Mexican cartels. And it's coming in and [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6845.92s)]
*  it's killing people. When you have 300, you know, opioid related deaths a day, and most of it's [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6851.68s)]
*  fentanyl related because it's coming through because our overworked border security apparatus [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6857.6s)]
*  is not being able to the job to the extent it can. People are getting fed up. You know, it's not, [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6863.04s)]
*  it's no longer a border issue. It is an American issue. And I think that people are seeing it and [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6867.84s)]
*  they're seeing the, the, the, it's being shrugged off at the, at the highest levels. And I think, [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6873.84s)]
*  you know, it sucks that it gets to this point, but if this is what's going to have to happen, [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6878.8s)]
*  this is what's going to have to have people have to got to wake up and make sure that we stop [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6884.24s)]
*  elected morons and get people in that have a, a good head on their shoulder that are pointing [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6888.32s)]
*  in the right direction. We can disagree. That's okay. But I guarantee you, if people will just [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6892.72s)]
*  pause for a moment and sit there and listen, they'll find more common ground than they have [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6899.04s)]
*  differences. And I think that's, that's the spirit of America. That's the spirit of what [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6904.0s)]
*  makes this country tick and why people still try to come over here every day. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6908.56s)]
*  Amen. Yeah. Yeah. No, I, I look, I think that you, yeah, you ha I'm just amazed that people [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6911.84s)]
*  would sit there in places where they're B they can't, they're not even brave enough to go to [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6918.16s)]
*  their own vehicle because they're scared. Yeah. But yet they would vote for policies and people [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6923.68s)]
*  that aren't going to, uh, make sure that they have police and street lamps. Yeah. You know? [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6928.64s)]
*  Yeah. It just, I don't, I'm just sick. I think it's, it's, it feels, I think our souls are [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6934.4800000000005s)]
*  starting to feel sick. Um, and I don't want to get just stuck in that. And I know you don't want [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6941.92s)]
*  to either. Um, so what is, what do solutions at the border look like? What does that look like? [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6945.52s)]
*  Yeah. No, great question. I think what we have to look at and, uh, it kind of, it, it's, it's great [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6951.200000000001s)]
*  timing because we've talked about kind of the evolution of what's happened over the, the past, [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6956.16s)]
*  you know, nearly 27, 28 years of my life, the, the adversary has, has changed. Right? So traditionally, [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6960.639999999999s)]
*  traditionally people would come across, you had your migrant workers, we talked about earlier, [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6969.04s)]
*  but then you had the criminal side of the smuggling operation, whether it was narcotics smuggling or [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6973.68s)]
*  people smuggling. This is people, the smuggler crossing the border, guiding the people to a [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6978.72s)]
*  vehicle, jumping in a vehicle and driving to the next city and then going to wherever they were [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6985.28s)]
*  going. Right. What do you mean driving who to like, yeah. So literally you would have like vehicles. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6990.639999999999s)]
*  I mean, this is all organized, so I'll use Arizona as an example. So a smuggler would come down [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=6995.84s)]
*  to, from Phoenix or Tucson. Okay. There'd be somebody on the American side, [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7002.96s)]
*  on American side, leaving a vehicle. Oh, I see. Coordinating with the South side. So it's a two [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7006.639999999999s)]
*  day walk to this vehicle. The smuggler is smuggling through the desert, avoiding border patrol, [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7012.56s)]
*  guiding people to this vehicle. And sometimes they all get in together and drive off. Sometimes [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7019.04s)]
*  it's so well coordinated that they, they know they're going to show up in this window, this one hour [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7024.72s)]
*  and the smuggler drives in, picks them up, and then they drive back to the next city. That's how [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7030.8s)]
*  it used to be. And there's still factions across the border where that's happening, where you're [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7036.0s)]
*  having these pursuits. I'm telling you, it was so fun back in the day when it was really cat and [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7040.24s)]
*  mouse games. Like we would chase these people for hours or shifts. Yeah. All those things on TV, [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7046.639999999999s)]
*  people being smuggled. You know, some of the funnest things. And you don't use lasso. You don't use a [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7052.5599999999995s)]
*  lasso. No, no, no, we don't do any of that stuff. No, we, we handcuffs and, but what I would tell [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7058.24s)]
*  you, what would be fun. And, and, and again, give it context. You got to realize you're chasing [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7064.32s)]
*  somebody that you, that's the, that's the thrill, right? It's part of the adrenaline. Yeah. You would [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7069.28s)]
*  get pursuits and they would be, you know, you go in high speeds or sometimes low speeds and then [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7074.719999999999s)]
*  they would bail out and people would, it was like hamsters Shaw shank and out of the back of a, [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7081.12s)]
*  I have a pickup truck, my friend bailing out everywhere. Right. And so you would throw that [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7088.08s)]
*  vehicle in the park and you would give foot chase. You had to go after the driver. It's like when the [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7092.719999999999s)]
*  pinata bus opens, you got to get the big snick of it. Yeah. So our goal was to go get the driver [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7097.76s)]
*  because that's who we could prosecute. And then you go round up everybody else. But that was, [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7103.360000000001s)]
*  that was fun. And you would even almost kind of like you and the smuggler would almost kind of like, [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7107.52s)]
*  all right, all right, you got me. Oh yeah. And so, and that was before we had all the databases [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7112.08s)]
*  and systems to double check that this person was being caught. Now we would know if we caught you, [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7117.2s)]
*  you know, 10 or a hundred times, but that was some of the most thrilling part of my job was [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7121.76s)]
*  it was rewarding because you were saving lives if you ended up rescuing people. [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7128.96s)]
*  But then there'd be fun. Like, you know, you'd pick up the two by four or the plywood on the back [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7132.64s)]
*  of a pickup truck. And it's like, Hey man, I can see you. And they wouldn't look at you, [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7137.52s)]
*  but you would get vans with you're it. Yeah. You'd get, I get 30 people in a van, you know, [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7141.6s)]
*  you get 10 people in a, in a Ford, you know, Fiesta. And you're like, how does this happen? [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7146.72s)]
*  What was really funny is you see these older model vehicles. I'm like, my vehicle, I, [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7152.24s)]
*  I would be, I wouldn't trust driving it to Michigan in the middle of the night. [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7156.400000000001s)]
*  These people didn't care. They were going, but we had some number one vehicle that got left down [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7159.84s)]
*  there by the way. Like, was there a one vehicle that was always like, if you saw, if you saw a [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7164.0s)]
*  suburban, any kind of SUV that was, that was always a, a, a, you know, just a giveaway. [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7168.56s)]
*  You're driving down a two lane border highway. And then there's next to a culvert, there's a, [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7174.96s)]
*  some kind of SUV. They love pickups because they could just jump in real quick. So, you know, [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7179.44s)]
*  pickups were very, extended cabs were great because they could put people in the front end [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7185.679999999999s)]
*  and, you know, you could, they would, if you drove by, they drove by you, you wouldn't see [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7191.04s)]
*  anything in the better truck and you couldn't see what was in the back. But we just knew, [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7196.0s)]
*  cause you'd see the yellow lights, cause they were usually older vehicles and they're riding like [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7200.32s)]
*  this. Um, but we would get into all that. It was so much fun or you would track people for days, [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7204.0s)]
*  literally like you go in, if you're a day shift guy, you're in at six o'clock in the morning, [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7211.12s)]
*  you're on a trail by seven, you work until three or four in the afternoon, turn it over to the [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7214.8s)]
*  next shift. You come back the next day and like, Hey, we're, oh, we pushed it 20 miles. So you'd [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7218.72s)]
*  go out there and work it in and you'd catch them. And it was people looking for work, people that [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7222.88s)]
*  were criminals, gang members, or there were, you know, back then it was the cash crop was marijuana. [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7227.68s)]
*  That was when everybody was backpacking marijuana. Now you don't even catch [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7232.72s)]
*  marijuana anymore. It's legalized in so many places, but it's, it's changed now. [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7235.4400000000005s)]
*  It's changed because again, for years, we fought a conventional war, if you will, [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7240.320000000001s)]
*  against a conventional smuggling now because of policies and the way things are so interconnected. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7246.240000000001s)]
*  Like people are making all the arrangements now on the cell phones using online, you know, [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7252.88s)]
*  social media platforms. The smugglers oftentimes don't even cross the border anymore. [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7258.24s)]
*  All the arrangements are made prior to people getting to the border. As I mentioned earlier, [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7265.5199999999995s)]
*  the large groups are being, you know, pushed through in one area. The other ones are using [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7270.719999999999s)]
*  their apps and I'm not going to name the programs, but they will communicate with the smuggler via [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7276.24s)]
*  cell phone and via apps doing DMS and, and, Hey, I'm lost. And it will send me a picture [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7281.68s)]
*  of what you see. And then they will text back. Okay. You need to go through this way. And they'd, [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7288.0s)]
*  they'd put a, they'd roadmap it for them. Oh, so the coyotes or whatever who are bringing them [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7292.8s)]
*  across usually aren't even going anymore. They're either in Mexico or in Phoenix. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7297.280000000001s)]
*  Cause they, and then, then everything's done through cash apps and everything else. So we have this [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7301.6s)]
*  beautiful thing called interconnectedness has made the unconventional, it made the adversary [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7308.32s)]
*  unconventional. So how do we attack it? It's one of the things that I'm doing right now. And this [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7315.44s)]
*  is necessarily a, a big pitch, but if the reality is, is there is so much online smuggling and [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7320.0s)]
*  trafficking done on our numerous social media platforms that children are being recruited to [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7328.48s)]
*  be smugglers. Children are, and people are being recruited to buy, you know, illegitimate, you know, [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7336.56s)]
*  narcotics, you know, underground stuff, you know, Hey, you want to, I've done it. We're using, [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7346.96s)]
*  Oh yeah. You can do this on the apps. And this is where it becomes so deadly because this, it may be [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7351.76s)]
*  pressed in a clandestine lab in Mexico as a Vicodin, but it's, they don't have the same [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7359.4400000000005s)]
*  sanitary. So now you've got residual fentanyl, you know, DEA put out a stat recently, like, [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7364.8s)]
*  like seven out of 10 off market things have enough fentanyl in it now to kill them. That's ridiculous. [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7369.4400000000005s)]
*  So one of the things, a solution that we have created, and I'm part of is, is using artificial [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7376.72s)]
*  intelligence and machine learning to target the online predators, whether it's human trafficking. [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7382.8s)]
*  How is it doing that? [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7390.72s)]
*  So, yeah, so this is, this is my company that I'm part of massive blue. So we, we basically use [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7391.92s)]
*  deep tech and to identify the, the habits and the process of, you know, look, I worked on a physical [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7397.04s)]
*  wall. Now we've created a cyber wall to protect and target those that are going after people. [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7404.400000000001s)]
*  Like there are, look, there were over, I think in the last seven days, close to 2000 unique [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7413.2s)]
*  individuals posting sex services in Nashville alone. Yeah. Who do you think those people are? [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7420.64s)]
*  You know, Theo, you and I are close enough in age to remember milk carton, missing kids in the [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7429.4400000000005s)]
*  milk carton. You don't see that anymore, right? It's this, it's these people, not only are they [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7434.08s)]
*  internationally being victimized and traffic domestically in Nashville alone, that many unique [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7438.24s)]
*  individuals, right? And about 25% of that stuff is narcotics crossovers. So not only are they [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7445.44s)]
*  selling people and services, there's also drug related. So we have got to take this [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7451.76s)]
*  unconventional approach and use the technology that they're using that use it. And we play by [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7457.92s)]
*  the rules, obviously, but we have got to create that cyber wall to protect our country, protect [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7464.56s)]
*  our community, our companies, because there's all sorts of corporate espionage and our children, [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7470.56s)]
*  most importantly, because if you think that, you know, kids are upstairs going to bed on a school [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7475.360000000001s)]

*  is really their friend or somebody that they know? This is where this, these predators and boy, [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7485.120000000001s)]
*  the sextortion, all the stuff that's going on. You look, that's, I did this for so long that this [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7491.04s)]
*  was where I knew, how can I continue to make a difference and not wear the badge and gun anymore [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7496.88s)]
*  is to go after the bad guy in an unconventional manner. And, you know, I think it's going to save [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7502.32s)]
*  lives. It's going to protect lives. It's going to, you know, there's so much we can do with it. Let's [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7508.48s)]
*  use the technology to our advantage. It's not going away, right? Let's use it to help. And if I can [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7513.44s)]

*  company do that? How does your company do that? Well, I'm not going to get into too much of it. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7529.12s)]
*  You're just saying, but that's where you're headed. That's where we're heading. Right. Yeah. So you, [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7532.64s)]

*  as a border patrol agency? Well, so I would love to be able to get this in the hands of the border [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7538.88s)]
*  patrol, because let's, let's think about what's happening right now online. It really takes a [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7542.56s)]
*  person staring at a computer, data mining, just going through websites and going through on, [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7548.96s)]
*  why not use technology? What I can do in an hour would take somebody a week or more. [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7554.72s)]
*  Well, and so this is how we can get this into, we're working with a couple of states and a couple [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7561.68s)]
*  agencies to, with this program to help them use this tool. It's a great lead generator, right? [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7567.92s)]
*  It's going to do that. And we're just, we're going to continue to evolve it. There's, we love online, [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7574.64s)]

*  well, it goes back again though, to why doesn't our country have, I've, and maybe this is me just [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7585.200000000001s)]

*  you're out of your mind, but you would think the one thing that you would want out of your government [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7595.6s)]
*  that you would get is safety. Right? That is the number one thing that people will always pay for [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7600.96s)]
*  is safety. And the fact that they just had Zuckerberg in court the other day, [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7607.76s)]
*  apologizing with no emotion guy. I don't know if the guy's ever had a feeling and he's in court [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7614.96s)]
*  because of families that have lost children or had children's sex trafficked or bought and drug, [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7622.4800000000005s)]

*  families of online child sex abuse. In an unscripted scene during tense testimony Wednesday, [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7638.5599999999995s)]

*  things that you families have suffered. Yeah. I mean, it's unbelievable. He's sitting there [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7659.2s)]
*  surrounded by all of his lawyers. And it's felt, it seemed like he didn't have an emotion. Like it's [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7662.48s)]

*  you can have an app where some predator can reach out to my fucking child and not go to fucking jail [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7685.92s)]
*  for it. I feel like these guys should be jailed. You know, it's the same with that family, the [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7692.32s)]
*  Sackler family that did the opiates with Oxycontin. It's like they killed hundreds of thousands of [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7698.0s)]

*  when it comes to this. We need to be able to come up with tools to combat this. Because look, social [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7717.679999999999s)]
*  media, the platforms, the different apps, it's not going away. We're not going backwards. So let's [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7723.04s)]
*  attack it from the front end. Let's beat them at the punch. And that's what my company has been [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7728.24s)]
*  doing. I'm super excited because I think that is a way that we can feel safe as a parent myself. [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7732.0s)]
*  I want my daughter to be able to, to, to, uh, enjoy the, the, the technology that's there. [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7738.8s)]
*  It's part of her generation, but I want her to be safe. And I want to be able to, you know, [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7743.68s)]
*  we're investing in this to make sure people can be healthy and, and, and, and, and live life. You [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7749.360000000001s)]
*  know, for every story I can tell you, there's a dozen more of parents that have lost their children [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7755.12s)]
*  on something as simple as I'm ordering this online and got delivered to the house. And I thought it [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7760.400000000001s)]
*  was a Vicodin and, and they woke up, well, they never woke up, you know, I met a, I made a lady, [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7765.04s)]
*  a lady a year or so ago, and it's exactly that her daughter had was dealing with some, uh, you know, [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7769.5199999999995s)]
*  recovering pain from, she was a gymnast and, uh, her friends were chatting online. She's like, [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7774.16s)]
*  well, you can, you know, you can order this online. And, and she did, mom went to bed, [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7778.4s)]
*  this got delivered, uh, to the house. Um, and she woke up, went upstairs to find her daughter and [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7783.5199999999995s)]
*  she was dead, you know, and, and she found the exchange on, on her phone, you know, and no parent [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7790.24s)]
*  should, you know, it's tough enough just to imagine, uh, losing a child, but when you lose [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7796.639999999999s)]
*  them because of something like that, that could be prevented, or at least there could be safeguards. [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7801.92s)]
*  There's gotta be, there's no way they can tell what kind of shit you like to look at and advertise [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7808.88s)]
*  you bullshit, but they can't tell, they can't keep, uh, they can't have a little bit more [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7815.28s)]
*  efficiency with figuring out who is able to reach out to children or who children are able to reach [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7821.679999999999s)]
*  out to. Now, I guess somebody could create and look, obviously I'm not arguing the other side [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7827.599999999999s)]
*  of it, that maybe there's like, somebody could create a plan, but if somebody hasn't been online [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7832.88s)]
*  long enough with a platform, then maybe they shouldn't be able to reach out to children [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7837.12s)]
*  or there should just be much stricter things in place. That seems like, [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7840.48s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know enough about it. It's a stark reminder that, you know, that there's evil [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7844.5599999999995s)]
*  out there and, uh, and, and so, uh, it's fucking winning. That's what it feels like sometimes. [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7848.639999999999s)]
*  That's why we're invested in this. I can tell you that there are platforms out there that will [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7854.639999999999s)]
*  recruit teenagers. And this is very prevalent Arizona in the Phoenix area to get an S you get [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7860.48s)]
*  your mom and dad's SUV, um, drive down. If you're interested in make a thousand bucks, uh, person, [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7867.36s)]
*  you want to make $5,000, you know, get an S of you DME here. And then that message disappears, [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7872.72s)]
*  right? But they're now they're, they're, they're messaging and they give them a pin drop and go [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7877.76s)]
*  pick up these five people. Well, now these kids and most of them are minors, 16, 17 years old. [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7882.16s)]
*  So they haven't been driving very long. Now they're in mom and dad's SUV. They end up picking up 10 [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7886.8s)]
*  people in some remote area near Douglas, Arizona. And they're told drive to Phoenix. And when you [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7891.92s)]
*  get to Phoenix, uh, DME, I'll give you a pin drop and don't stop for border patrol or cops. [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7896.400000000001s)]
*  They're doing a hundred miles an hour with 10 people in their car, top heavy. They don't know [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7902.4800000000005s)]
*  how to drive because they're young. Anyway, they're rolling over. People are dying. They're T bone [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7907.12s)]
*  and innocent civilians caught in an intersection, killing people. This is happening every day and [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7911.4400000000005s)]
*  they're using social media to coordinate it. So the smugglers are not at risk because they're [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7918.08s)]
*  starting doing the job. Yeah. Burn the account, burn the phone. They they're not, there's no, [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7925.04s)]
*  there's no overhead for them. They just used mom's SUV. Oh, and by the way, if you were successful [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7929.68s)]
*  and you got to the drop off location, they're going to say, yeah, I've got your license plate. [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7935.6s)]
*  I know who you are. I'm not going to pay you this time. You're not going to squeal because I know [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7940.88s)]
*  who you are. I know what school you go to. I know what your mom drives the hooks in, man, [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7946.0s)]
*  the hooks. And yeah, there's stuff right there. Yep. That happens. Migrants kill and pick up [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7950.96s)]
*  crashes, undocumented immigrants killed, chase on border. They killed eight. Yeah. Wow. It's nuts. [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7955.12s)]
*  And again, back to the solutions. How do we fix it? So we, we, we attack it. We have to attack [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7960.24s)]
*  at the front, right? We still have to secure that border, right? We've got to, we've got to plug the [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7964.5599999999995s)]
*  leak, not just what this administration and what a lot of politicians like, they could give you [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7968.5599999999995s)]
*  buckets to bail the water out, just fix the damn leak. Right. Right. Yeah. But if they fix the [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7972.72s)]
*  leak, then they won't have something to kick the ball around to use as a football. So we keep [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7978.72s)]
*  playing this game. Yeah, exactly. What do you, well, yeah, if you're the border, if you were the, [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7984.0s)]
*  you could make the choices. What would you do? Well, I finished what we started as far as securing [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7989.2s)]
*  the border where it made sense, what the agents need. Well, I don't need to get, like I mentioned, [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7993.52s)]
*  I don't need a wall 2000 miles, right? Right. But I, where I need it, I need it. Right. I need the [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=7997.52s)]
*  technology. I need the, I need the agents. I need to put some of these safeguards back in place to [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8001.6s)]
*  close loopholes in the existing policy. I would put immigration judges in mass to quick court [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8008.4s)]
*  these people. Like we do sometimes in municipalities, you know, night courts, right? Where they just go [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8014.5599999999995s)]
*  up there and see the judge and you, you know, where you're saying, so we can start then in the herd of, [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8018.96s)]
*  of this backlog, right? So the legislative side, you need help. Yeah. So, so is that legislative? [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8024.24s)]
*  Yeah. So we need some laws, just the laws and the books are good, right? But we need laws to hold [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8029.28s)]
*  the executive accountable to pursue the laws and not have the too much latitude. So I would, [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8035.84s)]
*  I would do some things and we need legislature to appropriate to fund, right? You need people to [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8042.4800000000005s)]
*  do the processing. Yeah. Well, so that, again, that's kind of one of those things where if we, [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8047.52s)]
*  if we minimize the flow, right, then we could handle that. That hiring more people to process [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8053.12s)]
*  is a bucket to bail water. It's not fixing the leak. Got it. Forcing them through the ports of [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8060.32s)]
*  entry through better lawful pathways, right? Instituting that migrant protection protocol, [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8065.44s)]
*  where they going to wait in the country they first stepped in for asylum until they can get here [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8072.08s)]
*  or until they can get those kinds of things. We can modernize and we can clean them up. [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8076.5599999999995s)]
*  A lot of these policies were highly effective. They were a little clunky to start, but they were [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8080.24s)]
*  working. They could have been smoothed out. That's what I would do. I would secure the border first [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8084.879999999999s)]
*  and I would start right away with working on the backlog and then the preventive piece, which would [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8089.44s)]
*  be better pathways, but I would do it by not my circle of friends in Washington. I'd be out there [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8095.12s)]
*  in every all 50 States saying, what do you need to make? And I don't want to sound political, but [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8101.92s)]
*  to continue to make this country great, to make sure that we are, you know, doing the right thing [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8107.36s)]
*  for we, the people and opening that door to our invited guests as we, as we need and see fit, [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8112.4s)]
*  right? We, the country should determine who and what comes in here and how they come in, not just, [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8119.92s)]
*  you know, come in in mass and we'll, we'll filter through it when we can. That's, that's no plan. [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8126.8s)]
*  Like you've mentioned, we, that would be the plan. Secure, clean up and preventive maintenance is [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8131.92s)]
*  what I would do, you know? And there's people out there that, that see that, you know, and that, [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8138.4s)]
*  that want to do good. They want to secure that. We want to find that balance. [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8145.12s)]
*  What do you mean when you say that? Like there's politicians out there that I think see this [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8149.679999999999s)]
*  from a, from a, a common sense and have you had some that have showed up like that? [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8156.4s)]
*  Yeah. Well, Bobby Kennedy, there's an example as a guy who's so we've had, well, let's talk about [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8160.8s)]
*  current. Oh, Bobby Gibbs, a fuck. It's unbelievable. You look at Bobby and you look at other, [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8166.48s)]
*  the other candidates, they're like, he, oh, he actually gives, he has thoughts and views on [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8170.88s)]
*  shit. Biden, I don't have, I don't know any of his policies. Trump is very like [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8176.32s)]
*  one-handed kind of in a lot of ways, you know, he doesn't elaborate. [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8180.5599999999995s)]
*  Biding is not, he's just not hell. It's just not fair what they keep doing to that man as a senior [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8184.639999999999s)]
*  citizen. I think it's sick. But yeah, Bobby is dialed in. Yeah. So I would say this. He has [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8190.0s)]
*  views. He has views on things. He'll give you reasons why he has, you know, you can tell that [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8198.96s)]
*  he cares. And I think he's open to whatever, but you can, I just like to have anybody that gives [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8204.48s)]
*  a fuck. I think that's, that's the, you're going to see in that video that there's actually picture [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8210.16s)]
*  me and Alan, what he posted. He posted a couple of things about with me on it today. I'll do this. [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8214.64s)]
*  I'll say this. They're in the current sitting political pieces. There's for every one that [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8219.039999999999s)]
*  gives a darn, there's a couple that don't care. Right? You just, you just get it, right? They're [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8225.84s)]
*  down there for photo op. They're, they're nodding their heads. It's like, they don't want to solve [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8229.199999999999s)]
*  that as we just talked about. So they can pawn it. Right. Um, but then there's again, there's, [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8233.76s)]
*  there's yours truly right there. So when you, yeah, I'm not trying to sound like I'm not some [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8238.880000000001s)]
*  right wing nut job. I just, that's the crazy part too. You start, they start brainwashing you to [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8244.48s)]
*  feel like you're some like far right crazy person. If you just think there should be organization [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8250.24s)]
*  to the fucking program, it's compassion and common sense is all we're talking about. Cause there's, [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8258.56s)]
*  I don't want us to not have people here. I don't want us to not have diversity. I don't want, [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8263.6s)]
*  I would hate that. I, but I don't want us to have people hiding in the desert who are scared, [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8268.560000000001s)]
*  who don't know what the fuck is going on, who don't know how they can, they don't have a path. [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8274.32s)]
*  Both people need immigrants to have a path. It seems like the, the current elected class, [[02:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8279.04s)]
*  if you will, and I'll just say the former politicians, current politicians, they, they, [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8285.04s)]
*  they present you with false choices. Like you can, and we've talked about a little bit today, [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8291.52s)]
*  either for it or you're against it. You can't be one of the other. No, that's not true. That's not [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8295.76s)]
*  true. You know, there is, there is some common ground and that's what I, you know, anybody [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8299.44s)]
*  to include yourself, that's why we're here today that wants to learn facts, to learn about the [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8304.24s)]
*  border or come down to the border and see what's going on. Not just a photo op, not just saying I've [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8309.6s)]
*  been there to check a box, but literally go down there and spend some time. Talk to the sheriffs, [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8316.64s)]
*  talk to the mayors, talk to the agricultural leadership, the farm and ranchers, talk to the [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8323.92s)]
*  nonprofits, the domestic violence shelter, talk to the superintendent of the hospital who had, [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8329.119999999999s)]
*  has a $21 million bill from illegal immigration that hasn't been paid yet. Who's supposed to [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8333.119999999999s)]
*  serve the community, talk to retired border patrol officials, talk to people that have lived there [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8339.119999999999s)]
*  to find out what's going on. Not what one TV show or news station says or the other counterpoints. [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8345.52s)]
*  Go down there and that's, that's, that's why I appreciate what Bobby did. He came down there, [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8353.28s)]
*  it spent three days. I spent maybe a couple hours with them, giving him my, my take, but that's [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8358.0s)]
*  longer than anybody else has spent. That's longer than the president, the vice president, the [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8364.32s)]
*  secretary goes off and, but look, this is somebody, that's what we want. We want those choices. We [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8368.16s)]
*  want that out of our leadership, whether it goes anywhere or not, you come down there and you listen. [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8374.24s)]
*  And when you listen, you can pause and you can maybe learn and, you know, maybe make a difference. [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8383.68s)]
*  And I think that's the critical piece as a country. As we talked about early, we want choices, [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8390.0s)]
*  we want options, you know, we want to look at a menu. We don't want to be told what we're going [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8395.44s)]
*  to do. And so many of our elected, I don't even call them elected leaders because they're not [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8399.199999999999s)]
*  leading. So many of the elected politicians, like you said, it's either one way or the other. [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8403.52s)]
*  It's either so strong handed this way and that's just not how we are. And so it's refreshing to [[02:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8408.560000000001s)]
*  have people that are actually listening. People like Bobby, they come down and say, Hey, I want [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8413.92s)]
*  to learn. Um, you know, uh, it's, it's a good thing. And I think we need more of that to, [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8417.04s)]
*  to make this country better. Yeah. Amen, man. I think, um, yeah, I would love to see Bobby get, [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8422.32s)]
*  uh, I don't know if most people know if he's on the balance. I think they're still figuring [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8428.4s)]
*  that out, but it's Trump, Biden and Kennedy. Those are the options. I don't even think [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8431.6s)]
*  some people realize that, uh, that Bobby Kennedy is an option. Yeah. You know, I tell you what, [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8437.12s)]
*  I listened to him often. I've, I've had the pleasure. Look, his campaign reached out to me. [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8442.48s)]
*  The others haven't. So I'm, you know, I'm, I don't care who you are. If you want to listen [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8447.04s)]
*  and you want to learn and you want to hear what I have to say, I'll be, I'll be happy to talk to [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8451.2s)]
*  you about it. Um, yeah, I think he is the campaign still trying to get on some of the ballots, but at [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8455.12s)]
*  the end of the day, that's the big three that are going to be probably left when it's all said and [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8460.64s)]
*  done. Don't, don't know how that's going to play out. Cause we still have a primary. There's still [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8463.76s)]
*  one Republican candidate out there, two out there. Haley and Trump are out there. You got Biden and [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8467.119999999999s)]
*  you got Kennedy. Haley has some good border policies, doesn't she? Well, I think she's, [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8472.64s)]
*  she's kind of, I don't know who's advising her. I I'm certainly not. Um, uh, I think she's about [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8476.8s)]
*  securing the border, but a lot more openness about it, you know, then, then, then, you know, uh, [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8483.12s)]
*  then some of the others, I think that there's, uh, uh, I think at least from Trump and Kennedy, [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8490.720000000001s)]
*  it's like, Hey, we got to secure the border, you know? And I think Haley is saying the same thing, [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8496.880000000001s)]
*  but I just, Biden's saying it now too, or their campaign. Well, it's that they're saying it. I'm [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8500.960000000001s)]
*  saying, yeah, the timing is, is, is impeccable, right? Right. The numbers at the lowest he's been [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8506.08s)]
*  border is a number one. So definitely a last ditch effort. Um, I can't imagine they're going [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8512.32s)]
*  to run. I can't imagine he's going to run for president. I just don't think it would be, uh, [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8518.64s)]
*  humane is my argument. Um, I don't think it would be humane to do that to somebody, you know? [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8524.8s)]
*  Yeah. Well, you know, what I will say is that candidates and campaigns are, uh, they, they [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8531.84s)]
*  change and evolve over a campaign cycle. So we're still, I mean, yeah, we're months away, [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8537.12s)]
*  but those are long months away. Anything can happen, uh, with whether it's, uh, the current [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8542.0s)]
*  president or the, the, the other contenders, I just glad that we've got, you know, uh, uh, uh, [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8547.84s)]
*  another option out there, you know, I think that's what's important. And, and, and again, [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8553.68s)]
*  super smart guy and, uh, you know, I wish him all the best. And I, you know, [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8558.560000000001s)]
*  Bobby, man. I've always liked the, I liked the underdog. You know, I like, I've always, um, [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8562.4s)]
*  I liked the underdog. It's fun to listen to him because he comes, he's smart on the, on the [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8569.6s)]
*  topics, right? And he can't even fucking understand him half the time, but that is just a vocal. [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8574.48s)]
*  Yeah. So I'm going to realize that some of us were like, he's drunk. I'm like, no, no, no, [[02:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8578.24s)]
*  he has a bad, uh, it's quarter. Yeah. But you know what, when you listen to him and he talks [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8581.76s)]
*  about it, look, he, he, he, he told me, he's like, I didn't see this border issue. I thought it was [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8587.76s)]
*  some right wing deal, right? Um, we don't have a country if we don't have this board. I mean, [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8593.2s)]
*  he literally changed his mind in 72 hours of where he was coming from. And to me, that's a win. And [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8597.68s)]
*  that is successful. And that is also someone that is showing compassion and common sense. [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8607.44s)]
*  And I've said that multiple times. I think that's what, what we stand for when it comes down to this [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8613.6s)]
*  border, common sense of security, compassion, not only for our agents in our communities, [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8619.28s)]
*  but also the migrants. And he sees that also wants to hold Mexico accountable. And they, [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8623.92s)]
*  cause they've got, they've got a stake in this claim too, because Mexico benefiting from, um, [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8627.76s)]
*  the current border security. Well, you know, well, first of all, it'd be very interesting how much [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8634.800000000001s)]
*  money transferred to Mexico. Um, when, uh, Marcus and Blinken went down there between Christmas and [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8641.28s)]
*  new years to address the issue. Um, cause all of a sudden we went from 10, 12,000 arrests a day to [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8647.36s)]
*  about 6,700 arrests a day. So, um, so you think maybe there could have been some sort of a payoff [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8653.28s)]
*  or something? Oh, they're absolutely foreign aid to help support their mic. Yeah. Uh, that's just [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8658.800000000001s)]
*  money in the coffers. Uh, look, I want to make it very clear. The Mexican people are beautiful [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8663.28s)]
*  people. They are God's very hard working. They are so everyone that I've met and even some of the, [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8669.44s)]
*  the officials, but the government of Mexico is very, very difficult to deal with. And I, [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8675.92s)]
*  I'll tell you that, um, I think that a lot of the, uh, you know, obviously there's the cartel [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8681.28s)]
*  influence on things and, uh, the, the, the, the amount of money that is coming through, um, [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8686.720000000001s)]
*  that country through smuggling and through just human beings transiting through Mexico to get to [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8695.519999999999s)]
*  the United States is astronomical. You know, when, when you, and so what I, what I will say [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8701.359999999999s)]
*  is they probably are getting some kind of financial support from the United States. Um, [[02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8707.92s)]
*  you're not hearing about the caravans anymore, right? They're, they're being disrupted. I'm sure, [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8713.039999999999s)]
*  I'm sure that's what Mexico's doing is caravans of two, three, 4,000 at a time coming up from [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8717.6s)]
*  Guatemala. They get dispersed and Mexico is, is taking some, um, some of the migrants that get [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8722.48s)]
*  returned and they're flying them back to the interior. So they don't have an immediate, [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8729.68s)]
*  you know, um, like given like taking them back, like men's teas or whatever. Yeah. So if, yeah, [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8733.84s)]
*  so if I, yeah, exactly. So if I caught you in San Diego and returned you in Tijuana, you just [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8738.64s)]
*  could come right back. Right. Well, if I caught you in San Diego, returned you to Tijuana and [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8743.199999999999s)]
*  Mexico flew you to a Guanajuato or down to Oaxaca. You got a whole, you got a whole, [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8747.04s)]
*  another journey to get back up to the border. So that disrupts that smuggling cycle and gives us [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8753.6s)]
*  so Mexico is cooperating with that, but there, it ain't happening without a lot of money. So I would [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8758.240000000002s)]
*  be, I'd be curious to how much, uh, arrangements there in the state department under Blinken, [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8763.36s)]
*  you know, there's state department has so much money. Well, how about send them 5 billion? [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8767.68s)]
*  That's what I would do then send them a decent amount and let's shut it down completely for a [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8772.240000000002s)]
*  while. Yeah. Well, but I, yeah, I don't know enough about how things work. Constitutionally, [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8776.24s)]
*  Mexico does not see immigration as, uh, they see that as a, as a, as a human right. There's no [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8779.28s)]
*  laws preventing. So it's very, so they don't have any laws preventing people from wanting to come [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8785.76s)]
*  here. They don't say, Hey, don't do that. Yeah. Right. Ah, okay. So that, that's a challenge, [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8789.84s)]
*  right? So they have a constitutional challenge. So they'd have to do things like we would do, [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8793.92s)]
*  use executive actions as long as it's not considered unconscious. So they've had to, [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8798.64s)]
*  they've had to navigate some things, but I'll tell you, they did it under president Trump, [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8802.48s)]
*  because of the different mindset in the white house, holding Mexico accountable. If you don't, [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8806.48s)]
*  we will shut this down. I will tear a few in Mexico. All of a sudden complied to establish [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8812.24s)]
*  their own humanitarian national guard and all those kinds of things. In fact, probably had the [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8816.8s)]
*  highest level of cooperation I ever had with my Mexican counterparts. Um, that changed a lot under [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8820.8s)]
*  this administration. Um, still good people, but they didn't have the pressures coming from [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8825.52s)]
*  Washington to Mexico city to do anything. And, you know, I just, uh, yeah, it's just challenging, [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8830.88s)]
*  you know, to ask another government, look, we should never be in the business of negotiating [[02:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8836.0s)]
*  with another country for our own border security, not as the American, not as the United States. [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8839.519999999999s)]
*  I get it. Other countries have to do that. That's why we have NATOs and things like that. [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8843.679999999998s)]
*  But the United States of America should never negotiate our security with another country, [[02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8846.8s)]
*  not, not here on, in this hemisphere. That's our, that's the, we talked about it. We hinted a little [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8852.32s)]
*  bit that the government's responsibility is life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness. You do that [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8857.76s)]
*  through a strong domestic security, a strong international security in the sense of our [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8862.08s)]
*  military to protect us. And I'm not saying going into wars, but just protect us and then a strong [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8866.72s)]
*  economy. So we can pursue happiness. It doesn't say we're going to be happy, but if the government [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8871.92s)]
*  would just focus on those three things and they get the heck out of our lives, we'd be a lot, [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8877.44s)]
*  a lot more fun. There's some safeguards like we talked about that that's the protection piece. [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8880.960000000001s)]
*  But at the end of the day, where does all that money go to? Right? That's crazy. [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8886.08s)]
*  That's what's baffling. And it's still at the same time, we're able to sit in a place that has heat [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8890.8s)]
*  and cool and, and have water and, you know, and food and know that we have, can go eat when we [[02:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8894.72s)]
*  get out of here. And I know that there's a lot of people that's far less fortunate than that in the [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8901.12s)]
*  world. But I again, go back to the fact that if we are healthy and safe and organized, then we as [[02:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8905.44s)]
*  individuals can best service other people who want to come to this country to stay or to visit [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8916.08s)]
*  or to work. We can better have a plan of how to make that happen as a group, but then as individuals, [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8925.76s)]
*  we can, we can service that and be a part of that, which makes you feel like you're part of [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8933.6s)]
*  immigration and you are, and you are grateful to share your country with other people. [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8941.04s)]
*  And that is a sense of pride, which gives you a sense of purpose, you know, and a lot of that [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8949.04s)]
*  disappears when there's not a program in place, I think. I think you're right. You know, the, the, [[02:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8954.320000000002s)]
*  the sense of purpose and contributing is important to just, just living a good life, right? And if we [[02:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8960.0s)]
*  can get our act together as a country and we can, can contribute and number one, clean up our own [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8965.04s)]
*  backyard, but then also help others contribute to others to come. Oh yeah, we can do, I just, [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8971.44s)]
*  we can do a lot more from a healthy place. It's hard. It's hard when you're not, when you, when [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8977.68s)]
*  you, when you're in fear, it's really hard to, to do your best and have just raised kids that are, [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8983.28s)]
*  it's just, it's not a, it's not good. And I love, you know, I love you having this platform [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8989.76s)]
*  and I think it's so important to be able to have these types of conversations because when you've [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=8997.04s)]
*  got a status, you know, a celebrity status, it's got a podcast or you're a, you know, a rock star [[02:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9002.56s)]
*  or you're an athlete, you know, you, you, you have an audience that is not, you know, doesn't always [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9009.44s)]
*  hear some of the things that are really going. So when you can use this platform that you have [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9016.88s)]
*  to talk about what's impacting people every day, that's impacting this country, I commend you. I [[02:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9021.76s)]
*  mean, like, look, I love it when I see people like yourself, you know, having these types of [[02:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9027.92s)]
*  conversations. It's so, it's so important because a lot of your audience, you know, they've heard [[02:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9033.68s)]
*  about it, you know, indirectly, but now they're actually hearing it today about this is the real [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9038.88s)]
*  problem. This is what you're seeing on TV is real and there's not a solution in place. There was a [[02:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9044.8s)]
*  solution, wasn't perfect, but it was working. But now it feels like there's nothing. Yeah. And the [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9052.16s)]
*  plan and we need a plan. We just need a plan. You need a plan. You do that when you hit your app to [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9057.679999999998s)]
*  figure out how you're going to drive the grocery store, but we won't do it to chart what's best for [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9062.8s)]
*  our country. I know it just, yeah, we need to feel safe so we can operate well. And I don't think [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9066.96s)]
*  it's a thing where it's like, I don't want anybody to come over here. I think it's like, [[02:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9072.0s)]
*  like, Hey, let's get this. We think should be in an organized space. You, so you can come over here [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9077.84s)]
*  and we can be here and everything can work well for the better of the people coming and the better [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9084.16s)]
*  of the people that are already here. Yeah. I would say the add to that foot stomp that, you know, [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9091.36s)]
*  like secure our border, recruit and attain and attain the best and brightest that we need. Right. [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9097.44s)]
*  Let's, let's have, let's invite people and let's have people sign up for the guest list. So we know [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9103.68s)]
*  who's coming, right? Let's have, let's have consequences for those that are taking advantage [[02:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9108.480000000001s)]
*  of those people that are violating the system. And then let's have full transparency about what's [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9113.2s)]
*  really happening so people can make informed decisions in their life. People need to know [[02:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9118.960000000001s)]
*  what's going on on our borders because it's impacting them. Not look when the, when the [[02:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9122.56s)]
*  administration is more about securing their narrative than securing the border, that's a [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9126.8s)]
*  problem. That's what I see the issue. Yeah. I'm sorry to cut you off, but that was something that [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9130.88s)]
*  was, that was very, very important that we have to have a plan. We have to, we have to create the [[02:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9134.32s)]
*  invite list and we also have let people apply to be on that list as well and just know who's coming [[02:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9139.439999999999s)]
*  in and we control that. Yeah. And the fact that there's only so many visas, it all just, the [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9144.08s)]
*  thing needs a huge overhaul and people know it. And I'm just amazed. I wish I could see a little [[02:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9148.96s)]
*  bit deeper. I don't know what's past the first few shovels of dirt, you know, what's holding the [[02:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9153.679999999998s)]
*  roots of some of this stuff in place that makes people want to keep it the way it is. Some of [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9161.199999999999s)]
*  that I'm a little foggy on. But man, I want to ask you one more thing. If you go to like the border, [[02:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9167.439999999999s)]
*  like you're going to Canada or something and they, when they look up your stuff on the computer, [[02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9172.4s)]
*  do they know everything right? When you go through there, like they border patrol, like, [[02:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9179.359999999999s)]
*  yeah. So if you're, if you're going lawfully in and out of Canada, they're going to, they're running [[02:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9183.279999999999s)]
*  your, your car, your driver's license, your passport, your, your drive, your vehicle license, [[02:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9188.0s)]
*  plate. Yeah. All that data. It's all public information that's in there. Oh, so they just [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9193.68s)]
*  have all of that stuff. Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's all in the databases, which is interesting because in [[02:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9197.119999999999s)]
*  New York, going back to sanctuary cities and policies, they refuse to share DMV, uh, motor [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9200.88s)]
*  vehicle information with the federal agents. So it's difficult for agents sometimes to run license [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9207.92s)]
*  checks on vehicles. How do you know who the smuggler is or who this person is that may be [[02:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9213.279999999999s)]
*  going through the border? I wonder why they did that though. It's just because it was just [[02:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9218.56s)]
*  seen as bad. But yeah. So if you go into Canada and if you go into Mexico, if you're crossing [[02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9222.56s)]
*  through a lawful port of entry, whether it's an air, land or sea port, when you present your [[02:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9227.44s)]
*  identification, it's going through everything that we've got on you that is a public record. So [[02:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9231.84s)]
*  your, your, your driver's license there. Um, it was curious because it's like, have you been here [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9237.44s)]
*  before? And you're like, oh shit, do they know if I've been here before? Do I know? Yeah, they'll, [[02:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9241.28s)]
*  they know your crossings. Uh, there's a, I'm not going to get into it. Well, it's not, it's not [[02:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9247.12s)]
*  anything that's, you know, you know, a secret or anything like that. But yeah, we have, uh, we have [[02:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9251.44s)]
*  records checks that know if you've crossed in the last 72 hours or how often your vehicle is [[02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9255.84s)]
*  crossed and same thing. There's visa entry, exit requirements in law. So we know when you come in [[02:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9259.68s)]
*  and when you leave the country, even if you fly a domestically, sometimes there's a, you know, [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9266.4s)]
*  you can take a, they'll take a picture just to track you. You can voluntarily opt out of that [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9270.56s)]
*  kind of stuff, but it's, it's part of it. Um, what, one last question. Why isn't the same problem at [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9275.68s)]
*  the Canadian border that's at the Southern border? Who's to say it's not, it's just not volume. [[02:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9282.32s)]
*  Right. So let's talk about that. Um, uh, uh, about 90% of the Canadian population lives within a [[02:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9286.88s)]
*  hundred air miles of the United States, all your major cities. And cause it's so much tundra and [[02:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9294.08s)]
*  wide open land. Yeah. Shout out Windsor. Yeah. Every, every major organization, terrorist [[02:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9298.24s)]
*  organization, affiliate like that has some kind of, you know, uh, uh, tie to those, [[02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9306.8s)]
*  it's all the cities in the world pretty much, but in that Canadian population, uh, in those [[02:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9312.56s)]
*  cities, right? So there is a threat on the Northern border differences. It's not sexy enough because [[02:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9317.679999999998s)]
*  the volume and I can't recall off the top of my head, but I think there was probably only like [[02:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9322.64s)]
*  eight to 10,000 arrests on the Northern border compared to the 2.4 million on the Southern border. [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9326.8s)]
*  So because of all the focus on the Southern border, we've had to shift resources internally [[02:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9333.12s)]
*  within the border patrol. So about, and I want to say too much, but during 21 and 22, about half of [[02:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9338.560000000001s)]
*  our Northern border agents were down on the Southern border. So that creates a vulnerability [[02:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9346.560000000001s)]
*  and go back to morale and resiliency. So in the frozen North, you know, you only have a few months [[02:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9350.560000000001s)]
*  that you can get your house and your life prepared for the winter. So when our agents are being [[02:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9358.240000000002s)]
*  deployed down South, they're left their family behind. It just creates a tough cycle. So by not [[02:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9362.48s)]
*  fixing the Southern border, you've created vulnerabilities on the Northern border and our [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9368.0s)]
*  coastal, which includes a New Orleans sector, Miami sector, and Puerto Rico sector, those same [[02:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9371.119999999999s)]
*  resources were shifted to the Southwest border as well. So we're creating vulnerabilities on our [[02:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9376.0s)]
*  coast. So it, without plugging that leak on the Southern border, you're creating vulnerabilities [[02:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9380.32s)]
*  everywhere else. So, I mean, we got that right sized a little bit better than we were. So I'm, [[02:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9386.0s)]
*  we're not as vulnerable up North as we were a few years ago. We're gotten better, [[02:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9390.96s)]
*  but it's still something we have to consider. So it does, if we fix the Southern border, [[02:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9394.72s)]
*  which this latest bill that failed was all about the Southern border, there's still a Northern [[02:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9399.279999999999s)]
*  border threat. I mean, again, we, we, we, you have to think broadly on this. Yep. You gotta think [[02:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9403.759999999998s)]
*  broadly and you gotta stay positive too. I know there's been a lot of like, kind of like, it [[02:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9410.16s)]
*  sounds dour here and there. It's a lot of looking at it and, and, you know, and even, [[02:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9413.52s)]
*  we gotta stay hopeful though. And that's where I'm at with it. And yeah, Chris, I got to hit an AA [[02:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9420.560000000001s)]
*  meeting, man. Thank you so much for your time, dude. You got it, brother. This was great. This is, [[02:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9425.68s)]
*  thank you for talking about it. I hope the audience, you know, appreciates it and just stop [[02:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9428.560000000001s)]
*  and think, man, if we can cause somebody to pause a little bit, to just take it all in and think [[02:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9433.52s)]
*  about, Hey, we can do better. I think, I think this is a win for the, for the show today. And, [[02:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9437.44s)]
*  you know, I really appreciate you, you know, having me on and talking about something. This [[02:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9442.08s)]
*  is a serious issue. But, you know, it can be solved, but it's gonna, we got to roll up our [[02:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9445.68s)]
*  sleeves and get it done. Yeah. Awesome. Chris, Clem, thank you so much, man. Yeah. I appreciate [[02:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9452.16s)]
*  your time, brother. I appreciate it, man. This is great. [[02:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMymiqYnNpM&t=9456.8s)]
