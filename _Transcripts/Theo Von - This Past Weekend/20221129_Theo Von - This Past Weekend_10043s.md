*  Dude, that's a great point cuz we've been looking at places and I'm like, I don't want something that's too corporate or something [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=419.16s)]

*  Here's what you do. You're here in LA. You're in LA. Okay, you get the audiobook and then we stuck in traffic you just [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=451.94s)]
*  Three days of traffic get through the book just fine. All right, that's how they should market them [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=459.02s)]
*  Yeah, how many days of four or five traffic, you know four days of traffic [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=463.64s)]
*  But one thing you said about it was individual that the end of there you you kind of almost did it a little bit of [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=468.38s)]
*  An equation on the individual it's kind of towards the later in the book. You talked about [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=473.62s)]
*  it was just like [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=478.86s)]
*  That each person is unique and you kind of went oh you went straight there. Yeah. Oh my gosh [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=480.7s)]

*  Cosmic perspectives on civilization and [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=496.70000000000005s)]
*  it's what the world looks like if you're scientifically literate and you have a [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=500.34000000000003s)]
*  And and you're thinking about Earth from space and the world looks really different not just the world physically [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=504.46000000000004s)]
*  But people's interactions are different. You have some strongly held opinion and I say no [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=511.1s)]
*  You know you think you you think you've deeply thought this through right, but you haven't [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=517.82s)]
*  There's this part of it and have you thought about this and have you thought about that? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=522.5s)]
*  I'm not here to hand you an opinion. I just want to make sure that whatever opinion you do have is [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=526.0999999999999s)]
*  Deeply is is rationally formed that you that you've folded all the information together [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=531.9s)]
*  Then I walk away and think how the hell you want. I don't care [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=537.7399999999999s)]

*  Like if you're looking at something from this angle [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=544.78s)]
*  What about look at it from this angle or what about look at it from the inside or what about a look at it from? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=546.9s)]
*  the history of its beginning like exactly and a quick one before I get to the the [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=552.1s)]
*  The how unique we are just a quick one, you know, I don't know if you you buy tuna [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=557.6999999999999s)]
*  Now when you buy tuna, it's very clear whether it's line caught tuna. Oh, really line caught. Okay [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=562.5799999999999s)]
*  That's a big selling point because when it's not line caught its net caught [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=568.14s)]
*  I don't know what happens when they drag a net occasionally. They drag a dolphin [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=572.98s)]
*  Yeah, dolphins are air breathing so if they're caught in a net they suffocate and die [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=578.28s)]
*  Oh, okay, you don't want that so you get line caught tuna and I'm just thinking so for people who just care about that [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=582.5600000000001s)]
*  I'm just I wonder [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=589.26s)]
*  What about the tuna cares about the tuna? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=591.5600000000001s)]
*  You did not give a rat's ass about the tuna like what what what? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=594.8000000000001s)]
*  And it's and and and then they said well do it kills the dolphin unnecessarily [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=599.84s)]
*  So then I said well then make dolphin burgers, okay [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=603.72s)]
*  You said you can't have that and I so why not you go to the deli? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=607.94s)]
*  Yeah, okay if a deli made dolphin salad sandwiches, they'd be picketing out front wouldn't there? Okay, I'd have a cut of it [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=612.8000000000001s)]
*  Look at your teal vaunt. Yeah, I'd love it. We had owl one time at Thanksgiving. Oh, thanks. Given. Oh, man. Okay, so [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=621.24s)]
*  my point is if you [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=629.64s)]
*  If you go to a deli you and there be picketers out front if you're serving dolphin [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=631.96s)]
*  Yes, you're slinging dolphin in there. Okay, now watch but what else does the deli serve they sell dead chicken? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=637.28s)]
*  Dead turkey dead salmon dead pig dead cow with with roast beef dead vegetables [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=643.56s)]
*  You all get to that in a minute, but they sell all kinds of dead animals in a sandwich [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=650.76s)]
*  And this is just another dead animal [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=655.8s)]
*  But somehow we [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=658.0s)]
*  Culturally philosophically we we've divided up [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=659.56s)]
*  All the kingdoms of life and we do carve outs. Yeah for what we want to protect and what we don't and often that carve out is [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=663.6s)]
*  Arbitrary at some level. Yeah, just be self aware of that [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=671.76s)]
*  Are you high and noble because you're saving the dolphin, but you're eating the tuna, right? [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=674.96s)]
*  I don't know that you entirely are so a dolphin is a mammal. Well, so are pigs and cows [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=679.44s)]
*  All right last I checked yeah, okay, they're just I think people they're not as graceful [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=684.76s)]
*  They don't they can't do as many well some also then admit that say I will not eat graceful animals [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=689.2s)]
*  I'll only eat clumsy animals that are ugly [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=695.12s)]
*  So it's a it's an attempt to just make you more honest yeah with yourself about the opinions you carry there's another one [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=700.16s)]
*  Let's say you're a vegetarian. This is from the chapter meat eaters and vegetarians [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=707.48s)]
*  Go there because I know [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=712.28s)]
*  That's rousin folks. That's what I'm saying. That's what I'm saying each chapter is a is a point of conflict in civilization [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=714.76s)]
*  I'm trying to illuminate [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=721.56s)]
*  Places where people could think differently or maybe not have to think that way at all because in fact what they felt would deep was deeply held [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=723.7199999999999s)]
*  Argument really just evaporates in the face of a cosmic perspective [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=732.06s)]
*  So here's one you're a vegetarian because you just don't want to kill animals [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=736.52s)]
*  Okay, you you don't want to kill fine so in your basement you have a humane mousetrap mm-hmm okay? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=739.4599999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I've seen you've seen those. Yeah, they had some of it's like a little it goes [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=746.66s)]
*  It's like a mouse condominium all right yeah, so they go in you got to check them every few days water [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=754.9399999999999s)]
*  Every few days because they'll they'll dry out all right so anyhow [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=759.5s)]
*  So you check it and then you and what do they do with the mouse once they captured? [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=763.26s)]
*  Let it free they let it free into the wall all right because they don't want to kill animals all right I get that [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=766.5s)]
*  But do you realize that a mouse in the wild? [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=771.62s)]
*  Lives between nine and eighteen months [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=775.06s)]
*  Because it's highly likely to be swallowed whole by a owl or pecked apart by all manner of woodland predators [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=778.34s)]
*  Okay, well carnivores and so so what you've done is doom [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=786.54s)]
*  You've doomed the mouse [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=791.54s)]
*  to be eaten [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=793.94s)]
*  Crematurely in its life so the best thing you can do for the mouse is leave it in your basement [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=796.1800000000001s)]
*  Where it will live sex up to six years of a full fat life in your basement, but you're not doing that [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=802.1800000000001s)]
*  No, because yeah, I guess it makes us feel some type of noble if we transfer it [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=809.1s)]
*  I'm just saying but you're really putting into a harder life in a harder life correct [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=813.6400000000001s)]
*  So if so if you want to say well, that's just nature's loop and circle well [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=818.46s)]
*  All right, so you're saying it's nature's circle to have a [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=824.12s)]
*  Eat it then feed by the way if you crawled into the domicile of any animal [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=827.52s)]
*  They'll kill you if they could [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=833.56s)]
*  They will kill your ass yeah, okay, bro if you if you lay down into an ant nest they will bite you [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=837.16s)]
*  So so I but we'll know we have the intellect and the power to [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=845.24s)]
*  Capture something and remove it from your home, and I'm just saying if you cared about the mouse you'd leave it in your basement [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=850.12s)]
*  Yeah, that's all that's that's my only point. Yeah, I think well [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=855.9599999999999s)]
*  That's a good point a lot of a lot of this book is like that [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=858.8399999999999s)]
*  It's kind of I thought it was nice about the book that you can kind of pick it up whenever you can kind of almost [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=861.24s)]
*  Start in on any yeah, because the chapters are independent of each other and but they're in each one is a is a is a [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=866.1999999999999s)]
*  way in a way a [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=872.56s)]
*  Chapter on the things we all argue about yeah the chapter on there's a one on politics [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=874.5999999999999s)]
*  They you know you left wing right wing. What are you arguing about and why and if you really thought it through [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=879.76s)]
*  There's the vegetarians and meat eaters. There's there's a chapter on life and death risk and reward [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=884.76s)]
*  That one there's a gap in the human mind. I [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=892.16s)]
*  Have no other way to account for this where we do it is not natural to think about [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=896.0s)]
*  Statistics and probability. Oh, yeah [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=902.12s)]
*  It's not natural and did you know that that doesn't feel as much fun sometimes that's true [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=905.7600000000001s)]
*  It ruins something what you want to be true or what you feel to be true [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=911.3000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, or the mystery it takes away the mystery and but I'm so but it's a triumph of human intellect that we even went [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=914.6s)]
*  You could figure it out in the first place [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=920.96s)]
*  Here's what you have you go to you go to Vegas and and there's someone puts money on a seven on the roulette [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=922.7600000000001s)]
*  And I'll say why are you sticking with the seven? [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=928.68s)]
*  Let's say it's do and then looking at and and the roulette table they have a list of all the previous numbers [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=930.8s)]
*  Yeah, and they say it hasn't shown up. It's do no, it's not it's not do every role has the same probability every time [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=936.68s)]
*  Every time it's not do [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=944.6s)]
*  What is so what is that feeling then that we get what is that? [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=947.12s)]
*  Telling you I'm telling other things that people rolling dice and they need a low number like a three or four [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=950.3199999999999s)]
*  So the roll the light the dice gently [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=955.4399999999999s)]
*  And if they need a high number they'll throw it hard no and so so do you know who exploits this about us? [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=959.52s)]
*  Casinos casinos know we suck at math and probability and statistics so they exist other [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=966.28s)]
*  Human beings learn this about human beings and created an entire industry to exploit it [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=973.92s)]
*  it's sad and [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=980.96s)]
*  My my people my people the American physical society physicists [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=983.3199999999999s)]
*  This is back in the 80s [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=987.96s)]
*  They were gonna have their annual meeting in in San Diego and there was a snafu with the hotel reservations [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=989.6800000000001s)]
*  Vegas said we'll take you you got 4,000 people with do we get at the MGM said we'll take you so all the physicists went [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=994.84s)]
*  To Vegas and we know probability and statistics [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1001.76s)]
*  We understand the fact that basically you don't win relative to the you know the end of the week. There was a news headline [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1004.62s)]
*  Physicists in town lowest casino take ever [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1012.6800000000001s)]
*  So it's just it's sad like almost the saddest chapter that I wrote well, why do we feel that? [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1018.2s)]
*  So what is that feeling that makes us feel like is it a feeling that we create? [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1024.28s)]
*  Is it a where does that come from that makes us feel like this is it? [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1029.0s)]
*  It's because we don't have the brain wiring to know otherwise. I [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1032.28s)]
*  Have no other accounting for it. We just don't [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1036.96s)]
*  Think by the way that branch of math was one of the last to be discovered [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1041.16s)]
*  Do you realize probability statistics was developed and discovered after calculus? Wow [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1045.64s)]
*  Why I can pick because I think it's because the brain kid doesn't even know how to go there [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1051.5600000000002s)]
*  I have a I have a research paper from the mid [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1055.48s)]
*  1700s which it feels like a long ago [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1059.6200000000001s)]
*  But a lot of math had been developed before that including calculus and in that paper [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1061.72s)]
*  It says I've just discovered how helpful it is to take an average of numbers [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1065.8600000000001s)]
*  Right, that's pretty normal stuff [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1072.04s)]
*  That's normal stuff and somebody had to discover this Wow about the world and so [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1074.04s)]
*  So we yeah, I guess we don't want because do you think also at that time? There was a lot [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1080.44s)]
*  There's also back then there's more sorcery. There's more wizard. Yeah, there's more less than eat than the Middle Ages and stuff [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1085.12s)]
*  But right there's still a few million around. Yeah a few and and so and so I think people there's a little bit more [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1092.28s)]
*  Mysticism then so [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1098.48s)]
*  Probability probably is something that probably would be the last thing you think about if somebody over here is you know [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1100.48s)]
*  Hester Prenton somebody at a damn that that's a perceptive party. What you're saying, I think is [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1105.1200000000001s)]
*  Because we had sorcerers and wizards and people with mysterious powers and shamans and things [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1110.72s)]
*  They could live [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1116.88s)]
*  In the mystery of the probability of statistics and you think it's a power that they wield and so there's no early [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1118.8s)]
*  To try to decode it because it's their powers, right? Yeah, so I agree with you [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1125.64s)]
*  I think right they hadn't really debunked all those powers on the head and religion was really at the at the [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1129.3600000000001s)]

*  By the way Jews don't think of hell Jews there's a Jews as a heaven but no hell and therefore there's no devil [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1385.3799999999999s)]
*  Oh, wow, what that's in taking the easy way [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1391.2199999999998s)]

*  Maybe they needed to less forces of control over their conduct than the Christians later did I don't know [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1408.26s)]
*  That's one thing about Christianity man is to sometimes it's like too much pressure [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1413.54s)]
*  Well, yeah, and no one could fulfill that no one can live up to that [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1418.1s)]
*  Which is why here's another one in the spirit of your earlier comment. Here's another one [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1422.22s)]
*  Oh, you got sick and this person didn't God is punishing you you did something [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1426.7800000000002s)]
*  Against God in the last two weeks. Yeah, you were touching your privates. All right, whatever. I mean we all do stuff [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1432.9s)]
*  Oh, I do [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1439.42s)]
*  And it's and it's easy to find it and say oh my gosh [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1441.18s)]
*  I must be punished for that and and when that happens then you blame starts getting handed out [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1444.16s)]
*  So here I got another one consider consider that Muslims the part of the rituals of being a Muslim is [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1451.82s)]
*  you're cleaning your hands and your feet and your and [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1459.8999999999999s)]
*  Your ears and your nose and there's there's an ablution whatever the word is where you there's a cleansing daily Wow [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1463.7399999999998s)]
*  Daily, okay good idea. My grandmother I think was Muslim then well, we'll just think haha [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1471.06s)]
*  But just think about this back then nobody's showering every day nobody people's [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1475.4199999999998s)]
*  Some funky times. Okay. All right, there's some people don't shower every day today, but you could and the United States [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1481.02s)]
*  We probably take more showers and anybody else in the world from the research I've done on that but point is [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1487.2399999999998s)]
*  if a disease comes through and it comes from contact or or [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1493.4199999999998s)]
*  some other thing because you're dirty [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1498.58s)]
*  You get sick and the Muslims don't oh so they seem powerful [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1502.58s)]
*  Oh my gosh and you're Christian they're Muslims yet you're saying they put a hex on me these heathens [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1506.1s)]
*  These done Jesus following [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1514.02s)]
*  Okay, this is how this can happen. I got another one. You ready this. I don't know. I'm still riding the last [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1517.1799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I don't want you ready. Okay, here it goes. All right, so we would later learn that many of the plagues. Uh-huh [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1523.5s)]
*  We're from a flea [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1530.54s)]
*  Okay, like from a arm like a little fly [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1533.5800000000002s)]
*  Oh, yeah, just a flea just regular a regular flea that the house flea that you get on pets [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1536.94s)]
*  Okay, so now watch so the flea would get infected and would bite you and you'd get the plague [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1541.42s)]
*  Okay, okay plagues have killed more people than practically any more than wars. Okay. All right, so [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1548.5s)]
*  So plague is like a blight on you. All right, so now watch what happens [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1555.46s)]
*  Where did the fleas come from we would later learn they came from rats and mice [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1560.42s)]
*  Yeah, okay that were infected with the plague [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1565.1s)]
*  So if your house had rats or mice and mice were common look at old Renaissance paintings [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1568.02s)]
*  There's mice in the corners of the paintings. It's really funny just to see this. I said I'll watch [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1573.1s)]
*  Maybe they were good luck, huh? If you owned a cat [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1578.06s)]
*  You didn't have mice [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1583.02s)]
*  See me get the plague you get the plague no, wait a minute who owned cats. Well, there are many women that owned cats [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1584.78s)]
*  So women didn't get the plague and they were therefore sorcerers. They were witches [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1592.1s)]
*  Witches and some of more and and you still associate a cat with a witch to this day to this day [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1596.86s)]
*  I mean when you're when you're you know, it's all about [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1603.8s)]
*  These are the two [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1607.86s)]
*  Couture [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1610.1s)]
*  So [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1611.3s)]
*  Acatromats those are them. So these are this is what happens when you live in a pre-scientific era [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1612.62s)]
*  The blame game begins, but that's fun as hell [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1617.26s)]
*  Well for a movie, but I don't want to live in those times [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1621.06s)]
*  Yeah, so this book is an attempt to unravel this blame game when you see things happening [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1623.6999999999998s)]
*  It's it's not my fault. It's your fault. Well, did you really look through your opinions and your thoughts and and and it was neat [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1630.54s)]
*  Someone made me mad. Yeah good good [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1636.3s)]
*  So I mean that I like fuck I don't want to know this [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1639.02s)]
*  I don't want to I want to believe what I want to believe [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1641.74s)]
*  No, no, it's bad because you knew it what you knew it's true and it's against your urges [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1644.54s)]
*  Yeah, it was like damn me. Oh, I want to believe what I want to believe [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1649.62s)]
*  That's what it felt like sometimes some but I'm not I don't think I'm heavy-handed [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1653.58s)]
*  I think it's their offerings right have you thought about it this way? [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1656.9s)]
*  No, I don't think it came off like I'm trying to think no, I don't think it came off as like no at all [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1660.42s)]
*  It was like I don't it wasn't my intent right if it ever felt that way that was it's just we you're a fact guy [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1666.3799999999999s)]
*  You're a factual man. Mm-hmm, you know, and I you know, I battle, you know, like I think I've always kind of battled the dark arts overall [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1672.22s)]
*  So it's like I've never really looked at a ton of the facts, you know [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1680.5s)]
*  It's always been this more ethereal sort of well what you feel want what you want to be true rather than what is true [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1684.4s)]
*  And by the way, that's a that that's that's coming a long way in life [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1690.58s)]
*  To realize the world [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1695.66s)]
*  This is the difference between the different kinds of truths [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1698.38s)]
*  I spent a chapter in the truth and beauty chapter. I just talked about just say spend a minute on it now [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1700.48s)]
*  So there's something called personal truths. This is something no one's gonna take in a free society [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1705.14s)]
*  No one's gonna take it from you if Jesus is your Savior and you know true to your bones [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1710.38s)]
*  That's a personal truth in a free society and especially in the United States where it's constitutionally protected your freedom of religion [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1715.22s)]
*  No one should take that from you. Okay, you'd have a legal case if they try. All right other personal truths [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1723.6599999999999s)]
*  Oh, well Muhammad is my last Savior on earth my last prophet on earth. Okay, that this would be a Muslim personal truth [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1729.6999999999998s)]
*  Other truths are Beyonce is your queen right or whatever the things you feel. Okay [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1737.54s)]
*  personal truths are the foundation of our [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1744.3799999999999s)]
*  strongest held opinions and [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1747.1799999999998s)]
*  In a pluralistic world society that we should cherish that this is why people are different from each other [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1749.38s)]
*  All right, you don't want everybody to be the same. Oh, that's called a [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1756.54s)]
*  Dictatorship. Yeah, if everybody aligns with exactly the same [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1760.54s)]
*  I know we don't want it the problem with your opinion if it's in a personal truth if you try to have someone else agree with [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1763.5s)]
*  you [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1768.9s)]
*  You have to have an active persuasion [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1770.3s)]
*  So what but in the limit that becomes all-out conflict and war [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1772.94s)]
*  Personal people fight over personal truths kill each other because their personal truths don't agree with your personal truth [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1778.58s)]
*  So personal truths when they go outside of yourself [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1783.9399999999998s)]
*  risk [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1787.78s)]
*  Bloodshed right in the history of civilization has demonstrated this. All right, then there's a political truth [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1789.1s)]
*  Which is just something that becomes true just because you heard it often enough and that's a weakness. We have it not a weakness [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1795.5s)]
*  Evolutionarily it made sense if you see something repeat a hundred times that's reality. Oh, yeah. Okay, but you know what happens now [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1801.74s)]
*  People have hijacked [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1810.46s)]
*  that urge to [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1812.46s)]
*  Recognize that something that repeats must be true. They've hijacked it now [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1814.94s)]
*  They just find something that they want to be true and they repeat it to you you hear it enough must be true [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1818.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, there it is. Yes festival nowadays [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1824.1000000000001s)]
*  Also, we have you know since we have technology and we have this advancement like, you know with the internet social media [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1827.1s)]
*  It's so it's easy to get things in front of people so many times. Yes. It's easy to having our attention span has been [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1832.58s)]
*  Hijacked it's been hijacked completely. That's the word. There's no other word but hijacked and in the old days [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1840.34s)]
*  We called it brainwashing where you repeat something and then it becomes true [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1845.36s)]
*  That's hijacking this feature of our evolutionary brain that it's trying to create order out of chaos [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1848.86s)]
*  Like Stockholm syndrome, we almost are slowly developing almost [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1855.78s)]
*  Some variants seem like of a Stockholm syndrome or something like we're like all like Elizabeth's smart, you know without the or Elizabeth dumb [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1860.02s)]
*  That's who we're becoming. You know, I'm saying we're all like, you know [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1868.38s)]
*  We don't we're just bearing with what we have to deal with all the time [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1872.1000000000001s)]
*  Exactly. And so you try to sift through what is true and it must be that which was repeated often enough [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1875.6200000000001s)]
*  That's a political tree then there's an objective truth [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1880.92s)]
*  Okay, what is objective and the methods and tools of science are [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1883.6599999999999s)]
*  Exquisitely tuned to establish objective truth. So these are truths that have been demonstrated by observation and experiment and [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1888.02s)]
*  Repeated experiment. What is the word objective objective means? [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1896.7399999999998s)]
*  It's true whether or not you believe in it. Okay, so it's no doubt true [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1900.4199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, because I can show that it's true and it's not my bias that thinks it's true. Here's the data [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1904.58s)]
*  Now you see, you know, I don't believe you I think you had a bias [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1909.7s)]
*  I I think your wall current affected this so I'm gonna do it on 240 volts while you did yours on 125 volts [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1912.54s)]
*  Oh 20 volts you do a different experiment of your own design you get the same result [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1918.76s)]
*  That's objective. It's a fact when you do it enough times and they're all experiments agree. This is this is why science [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1923.3s)]
*  It wasn't really developed as we now practice it until around [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1931.02s)]
*  1600 all right [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1935.38s)]
*  I know that feels like a long time ago, but a lot of the world unfolded before then [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1936.5600000000002s)]
*  All right. And so once we learn if you say something is true, let me test it [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1940.22s)]
*  Let me let me find out let me devise an experiment [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1944.74s)]
*  And if I can verify your statement with this experiment and someone else can in a third person, we're good here [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1948.3400000000001s)]
*  That's an objective truth. And what objective truths have going for them is that they're true whether or not you believe in them [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1953.8600000000001s)]
*  I don't like them [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1960.8200000000002s)]
*  Well, but because the actual nature can't be fooled [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1963.82s)]
*  Nature is the ultimate judge jury and executioner. Yeah, if you overeat this week and you gain three pounds next week you can [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1968.22s)]
*  Protest with placards saying I protest the law of gravity because it made me heavier [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1976.06s)]
*  No, you don't have that option [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1981.74s)]
*  So it seems to me if you're gonna base laws on things [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1984.26s)]
*  But there's a whole chapter here on on law and order right if you're gonna create laws in a pluralistic world [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1988.1s)]
*  You base the laws on the objective truths, right? [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1994.62s)]
*  Because that applies to everyone don't base a law on your personal truth [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=1997.5s)]
*  Because that's forcing it on me and I have a different personal truth is climate change an objective truth. Oh, yes. Oh [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2000.6599999999999s)]
*  Yes, so what happens is you believe in climate change? It's not a belief. It's not a belief, right? [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2008.62s)]
*  When it's objectively true, you don't have to believe it it just is true. Yeah, it's I believe in when it's really hot I believe [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2014.6000000000001s)]
*  So like we got a fight this [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2030.68s)]
*  So here's a thing [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2033.8400000000001s)]
*  So so if it was only determined that way, uh-huh [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2035.52s)]
*  Then another person that was in a cold snap would say no, I don't believe it right and everybody's making up their own [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2039.52s)]
*  Theories about it because there it's their own life experience, but an experiment [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2044.96s)]
*  Takes the information out of yourself. Okay, it's not your perspective. It's not your bias [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2049.7599999999998s)]
*  It's not your worldview and you get all the data available and then you establish the objective truth [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2055.08s)]
*  So so in climate change and I give an example here in the probability in the risk and reward chapter [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2061.08s)]
*  You probably heard the number 97 scientists say it's happening. It's yep. It's all that in the last 20 years [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2068.6000000000004s)]
*  They're basically no scientists left denying it. So it's basically 100% and rain one holdout [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2075.6000000000004s)]
*  I know but let's go back to when it was 3% because that's a fun number. Okay, right? Let's do an experiment some engineers [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2080.96s)]
*  There's a bridge that's there. You don't know where it came from [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2088.48s)]
*  but it's a bridge but it's brand new and it's about to open and you say I want to drive my truck across the bridge and [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2091.48s)]
*  And [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2096.7200000000003s)]
*  97 engineers come up to you and say [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2097.92s)]
*  But I don't know any of the other engineers. So we're not in cahoots or anything [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2100.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, if you try we truck that's gonna collapse and you're gonna die [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2103.48s)]
*  You will likely die [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2107.04s)]
*  Plunging into the ravine. So 97 of them say that three say Oh Theo [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2108.76s)]
*  Go take your f-150 drive across [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2114.0800000000004s)]
*  Go on you'll be fine [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2121.2000000000003s)]
*  What are you gonna do making my way [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2123.4799999999996s)]
*  He's feeling it he's feeling the same and I take the general [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2130.12s)]
*  But no I feel you so so so you would probably [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2136.9199999999996s)]
*  Listen to the 97 engineers, especially if you're not an engineer yourself [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2140.56s)]
*  Yeah, especially if you got to look the engineers in the eyes now [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2144.2s)]
*  No, I got nothing to do with this that you're trying to be human about this. Don't be human [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2147.24s)]
*  That mess you up [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2153.24s)]
*  Let me feel what you're saying no, they'll show you the research papers, there's no eyeballs in the research paper [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2156.4399999999996s)]
*  There's no emoticons [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2162.0s)]
*  So then what is that that makes me want to look him in the eyes and see what is that? [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2165.64s)]
*  Oh, I'll tell you I tell you it's a good one. It's a good one [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2169.64s)]
*  We and again, I think it's understandable [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2173.8399999999997s)]
*  Evolutionarily if you look someone in the eye and they tell you something that just happened [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2177.16s)]
*  That is more true to you [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2182.3199999999997s)]
*  Than a statistical table [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2185.12s)]
*  With charts right bar charts than a pie graph that a pie graph that says the same fucking thing [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2187.7999999999997s)]
*  So that and advertisers know that they hijacked this [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2193.9199999999996s)]
*  Okay testimonials, but now watch they could just show a bar chart and say this [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2197.96s)]
*  Detergent is better than all the others and here's the data they could show that but no [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2202.3199999999997s)]
*  They show some parent and a kid and they put it in the machine [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2206.3999999999996s)]
*  They pull it out and look how clean and that the eyewitness testimony [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2209.92s)]
*  has huge [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2214.2400000000002s)]
*  value to our emotions because another human being is [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2216.2400000000002s)]
*  Communicating it right and so you so so I give it another example. You could be it's a little more obscure, but [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2220.16s)]
*  You you read in like consumer reports or whatever that this one car is like a vacuum a vacuum [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2227.32s)]
*  Sure [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2233.76s)]
*  It's the best one and it's working every time you walk into the vacuum store [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2233.96s)]
*  You saw the data and someone's walking out [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2237.46s)]
*  Saying I will never buy one of these again. It's stuck. Oh, you can't say a vacuum sucks. Sorry [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2240.86s)]
*  No, this vacuum was awful, oh it reversed and it made my whole place [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2250.98s)]
*  I would never do that and you you you hear this the person you don't even know them [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2254.98s)]
*  But they're not a human and they're speaking with a motion effect on me and there's there's fire in there [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2260.58s)]
*  Gaze, okay, you're gonna back out and walk out of that store [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2267.04s)]
*  You ain't getting anything [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2271.76s)]
*  Broom I'd rather use a fucking broom. Okay, so I think it's natural [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2274.1600000000003s)]
*  To trust another human right that context [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2279.96s)]
*  But that's why we have to train ourselves to trust the data [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2283.7200000000003s)]
*  And in science when you become a scientist, I'm taking statistics and data analysis and probability [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2288.52s)]
*  Essentially every year I'm in school it's not just one class and you move on there are different nuances over there different ways [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2294.36s)]
*  You think about it different ways you ask questions. You know what science is. It's a professional way of querying nature [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2300.4s)]
*  So that you can not fool yourself into thinking something is true. That is not or that something is not true. That is [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2307.8s)]
*  Mmm, did I say that right? Whatever the opposite you might have [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2316.0s)]
*  I [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2319.98s)]
*  Don't know I was following it. No, no, I'd say that you don't want to be fooled [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2321.06s)]
*  Because nature can't be ultimately nature coming right and we have biases where so you don't want [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2325.86s)]
*  Do whatever it takes. I'm gonna give you the scientific method do whatever it takes and I'm gonna read word repeat that do whatever it takes [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2332.42s)]
*  To not fool yourself into thinking something is true. That is not where that something is not true. That is [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2340.3s)]
*  Doesn't mean getting a video of it. Does it mean getting it getting someone else to check on you? [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2347.54s)]
*  Did you did you have your coffee this morning or not? Is that the measure? Were you more alert? [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2351.6200000000003s)]
*  Did you miss something right do whatever it takes and when you do that and I got nothing to do with the passion in their eyes [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2356.58s)]
*  Just okay now, so let's take this into a something that is the realm that doesn't have as much [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2365.7000000000003s)]
*  Probability probably go for it. So let's take it into the realm of love right love it or affection. Mm-hmm things like that [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2371.94s)]
*  So whenever you met are you married? Yes, I married 34 years. Oh, yeah [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2377.7400000000002s)]
*  Wow, that is a damn record almost [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2382.82s)]
*  You should win a Nobel Prize for that [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2385.54s)]
*  I met her in relativity class. She has a degree in mathematical physics dang in graduate school. So that was fun [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2388.38s)]
*  Yeah, I met her in relativity. That's wild [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2394.54s)]
*  So [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2397.1s)]
*  She's talking about love. Okay love [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2399.1s)]
*  So do you I mean are you do you take these same? [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2400.82s)]
*  Concepts into like whenever you were falling in love and stuff like that or was it more like a normal? Okay, so you saw in class [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2404.26s)]
*  So so the answer is yes, I do [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2411.06s)]
*  Wow, I don't often talk about this you want to hear you want to hear. Yeah [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2413.58s)]
*  Well, I'm just curious cuz I'm not I don't have a wife or anything yet. Well, it's mathematical [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2417.36s)]
*  Okay, then this could be helpful to you. Okay, okay could be helpful. Okay at this point I'll take on anything [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2420.42s)]
*  It's a little bit of mathematical. Okay, how much math have you had in school? I took a couple of them [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2425.7s)]
*  Took at least yeah [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2432.22s)]
*  Okay, one of them at high altitude I took one class out in Arizona at pretty high out [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2439.06s)]
*  You know what they say that if you learn something under certain psychomotor [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2443.3399999999997s)]
*  Conditions that you recover it better under those same conditions [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2448.02s)]
*  Oh, wow, like if you get high and you learn something [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2451.16s)]
*  You get high again later you learn you remember that better because you match the mental states. Oh, yeah [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2453.48s)]
*  I've read that I haven't read it lately, but a few decades ago [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2459.0s)]
*  Here it is all right here it is all right [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2468.3199999999997s)]
*  You got follow me with some math here. Okay, right. It's not complicated by the way [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2471.68s)]
*  I don't know any dumb professional comedians. You all are smart people. You're perceptive. You know, what's going on [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2475.8199999999997s)]
*  You have to know deeper what's going on to come at it from the other side and show why it's hilarious [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2482.74s)]
*  Okay, that takes insight you guys are the keepers of the soul of the social and cultural mores of civilization [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2488.18s)]
*  Yeah, I think a lot of us try to be Jesus [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2496.66s)]
*  I don't know what I'm doing, but I think a lot of us try to do our best [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2498.86s)]
*  Yeah, you're holding up windows not windows mirrors to what we think say and do and so it's a fundamental part [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2502.62s)]
*  I think of modern [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2510.2599999999998s)]
*  Existence because without it my gosh how how how unpleasant the world would be it would be these perspective [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2512.5400000000004s)]
*  That's my I'm not just blowing smoke [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2518.5800000000004s)]
*  I'm just saying and you especially have a certain authentic honesty that is palpable and it's like whatever you say [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2520.0600000000004s)]
*  With I'm with you on I feel you this way [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2528.1400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, you're saying do you feel what the person if I can't feel what you're saying go home, right? [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2530.98s)]
*  Right. What are you doing? You just just just type it up and send, you know text it to me [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2535.0200000000004s)]
*  If I'm not looking and you're in the eyes, you know, so okay. Yeah. Well, it's helping me cuz it's like, you know [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2539.26s)]
*  I think I have a tough I'm not like a naysayer of science [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2544.78s)]
*  I love you know [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2547.98s)]
*  I'm grateful for science because I exist and I'm grateful that the world exists and that we're able to have all types of different [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2548.7400000000002s)]
*  experiences of like caring about each other and getting to travel and see different things and that my eyes work like I'm super grateful for [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2555.38s)]
*  Science I think sometimes I get a fur like I have a fear sometimes of like if anything's out of like [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2562.46s)]
*  The V like out of like right here everything else can seem a little bit questionable, you know [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2569.86s)]
*  You know, it's just probably a questionable part is because you you create your own worldview [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2577.18s)]
*  Yeah, and you're and you everything makes sense to you in your worldview and something's trying to poke it from the outside [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2581.66s)]
*  You're understandably skeptical of it. Yeah [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2588.18s)]
*  I'm probably skeptical or rejecting it because no I got my thing much much situation. Yeah works for me [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2590.9399999999996s)]
*  Yeah, and I like to just I like to daydream and stuff, you know, so science sometimes they want to really hey, bro [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2597.62s)]
*  You know, we need you to pull these daydreams over here and we got a tag [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2604.1s)]
*  Get the weight in the and the density of these daydreams so we can have them on file [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2610.3799999999997s)]
*  So I respect it and I'm really really grateful that you're here [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2615.14s)]
*  But yeah, so tell me about that when you went into love so here it is and this is a little geeky [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2620.1s)]
*  Yeah, it's a geeky thing. So [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2624.5s)]
*  alright [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2627.38s)]
*  You can have a line and you can measure the length of the line. Okay, it's in right whatever. Okay [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2629.46s)]
*  That's the only thing you can measure about it. There's no area. There's no volume. It's just a length [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2635.9s)]
*  all right now I can add another line at like right angles to it and [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2640.42s)]
*  When I do that I can actually trace out a square, okay [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2644.7799999999997s)]
*  So now a square has more than just a length it has area [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2651.54s)]
*  Okay, this area inside the square and that area is defined by both both axes. You need both to get an area [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2655.9s)]
*  Mm-hmm. Okay. All right, let's add a third axis. Oh now XY now Z [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2663.54s)]
*  Now you don't have a line. You don't have a square. What do you have? You have a cube now [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2670.02s)]
*  I'm on mushrooms. I know [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2673.82s)]
*  You have a cube that's full each of these rights and now you're really okay, right now watch [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2675.9s)]
*  Now you I can take that to higher dimensions, but I won't I'm gonna stick to three [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2681.54s)]
*  Okay, you can go to four and five dimension. Let's stick to three. So now you ask yourself [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2685.34s)]
*  What do you care about in a relationship? [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2690.5s)]
*  Okay, you want the person to look hot nothing wrong with that [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2693.82s)]
*  Make a note of that. Okay [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2697.82s)]
*  You want the person to be good in bed [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2700.54s)]
*  Okay, that's fine. Be honest with yourself. That's another by the way, you can be hot and not good in bed [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2704.54s)]
*  Oh, yeah, or vice versa. Okay, so so these are separate [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2710.6200000000003s)]
*  coordinates [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2715.46s)]
*  Okay. Okay. So all right now watch let's get a third one [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2716.9s)]
*  You want the person to be kind? Let's say kind you want an evil evil person [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2720.9s)]
*  No, so each of these is completely separate from the other you can be beautiful and and and evil [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2727.62s)]
*  You can be ugly and kind you can be but you care about those three, right? So now rate this person [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2733.7s)]
*  From zero to ten in those three categories. Just go ahead and do that. So you say [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2741.2599999999998s)]
*  Persons really kind and the great in bed only give him a five [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2747.4599999999996s)]
*  Okay in looks the great in bed in their kind. All right, here's what you do [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2751.2999999999997s)]
*  You know how you get the volume of a cube you multiply x by y by z [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2755.32s)]
*  Okay, the area of a square is is x times y [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2759.7200000000003s)]
*  The area of a the volume of a cube is you multiply all three. I'm telling you to take those three numbers multiply them together [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2763.6800000000003s)]
*  You will get the volume of your love [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2770.88s)]
*  the volume of what you care about [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2775.1600000000003s)]
*  Okay [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2778.0800000000004s)]
*  So now watch now, here's my point [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2779.36s)]
*  What you need to do is [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2782.0800000000004s)]
*  Is because presumably you're if you're in the field the different people out there get each person's volume [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2784.16s)]
*  and [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2791.64s)]
*  Go after the person that has the largest volume [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2793.56s)]
*  Because they might be higher in one than the other but if you really care about them [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2797.44s)]
*  It's the total the totality of that package that matters [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2801.72s)]
*  Especially in a relationship [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2807.2s)]
*  Those features don't always stay the same they could vary [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2809.6s)]
*  Yeah, sometimes they grow better looking as they get older or they might you might get more attracted to them or less [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2812.64s)]
*  Attractive or less attractive. So this very might learn different skills [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2818.04s)]
*  Often some of them get less, you know, yeah, it's a mix. It's a mix [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2821.52s)]
*  so let's say they get a little less attractive, but the other bits were strong so you have a volume a [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2826.12s)]
*  Strength of a larger volume to work against okay if things start [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2831.56s)]
*  shifting okay in this [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2836.8399999999997s)]
*  I'm telling you you can take that to higher dimensions [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2839.64s)]
*  So it really bet what are they hot or they have a maybe a good sense of humor something you might value for sure [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2842.4399999999996s)]
*  Okay, are they curious? [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2849.24s)]
*  Do they want to keep learning? [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2852.7599999999998s)]
*  Okay, that's important. Do you have of course? [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2854.6s)]
*  Why wouldn't it be all right because I want them to keep learning about me because no that's just no [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2857.04s)]
*  If they're if they're curious you're part of what they want to keep okay, that's fair. No [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2862.96s)]
*  You're right. Okay, so I so so I went around with a five dimensional [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2869.48s)]
*  So in math we call it five dimensional vector space in this looking your love life. So that's what I did. Okay [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2875.0s)]
*  So what I'm saying is there could be someone who's the hottest person you've ever seen and [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2882.6s)]
*  And and you could be distracted by that [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2887.9199999999996s)]
*  I'm marrying that person and then they're not so hot ten years from now or they get a little chubby whatever you're valuing or [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2891.04s)]
*  Then all of a sudden everything you marry the person for isn't there anymore and [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2898.16s)]
*  Then you divorce seven years later [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2903.04s)]
*  So you gotta look at that volume gotta look at the volume and by the way [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2905.2400000000002s)]
*  Be crass if you want to be crass. Do you want to marry someone who's wealthy put that in there to put it in there [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2908.88s)]
*  Okay, don't be ashamed of that. Right because any one of these can change people say oh I want just that shallow [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2913.88s)]
*  You need a personality people's personalities can change. Why are we sometimes ashamed? [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2920.52s)]
*  To look at the criteria we honestly want to look I I got my I got through that I [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2925.3599999999997s)]
*  matured out of that because because society wants you to not want that [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2931.7999999999997s)]
*  And if someone is honest, I'd like your wealth. I enjoy it and by the wealth can go away, too [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2937.08s)]
*  Yeah, same way you're looking all the all the things can but if it matters to then it's one of the coordinates in this volume [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2942.0s)]
*  by the way, if any of those go to zero [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2949.64s)]
*  Because the volume is a product you're multiplying these numbers if anything goes to zero the volume goes to zero [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2954.14s)]
*  Oh really? Yes. Oh cuz you do not adding them. You're multiplying them. So so [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2960.46s)]
*  Try to make sure [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2968.66s)]
*  That the likelihood of it going to zero is or if it does go to zero if you don't matter [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2970.3399999999997s)]
*  Then it shouldn't have been in the right it has to be things that nothing could go to zero [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2975.1s)]
*  So then but and if you do that, then you're probably gonna be picking things that have [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2978.58s)]
*  Some real value to you overall value correct or just be honest [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2982.42s)]
*  I just want money and if you if you went out of money, I'll divorce you right and but the person could be fun and [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2988.56s)]
*  Happy the whole other time. Oh, yeah, they're buying sandwiches for everybody. Y'all are having a good time or whatever [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2993.7400000000002s)]
*  I don't you know, that's people are their own individuals. So what happened? [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=2999.04s)]
*  I just judge what happened when you got the lady you invite her out. Where'd you take her? Where do you? Oh [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3002.62s)]
*  Well, we you know, we were graduate students at the time, you know [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3007.98s)]
*  Very poor, you know, so a big meal is like a $12. Oh, yeah dish and [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3011.6s)]
*  So I'm oh [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3018.28s)]
*  I have to say this if I'm Aaron all the thing so I took her for granted initially [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3020.84s)]
*  Oh and and we broke up initially and then I and then like six months later. What the hell that I just do [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3026.52s)]
*  Oh my gosh, I went back to that volume and I said all these other people are not [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3033.36s)]
*  Filling that volume the way she did and I was really sad. Did you go back to her? [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3038.62s)]
*  I was I could because I broke up. I can't what are you gonna do? You can't do that. She [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3043.74s)]
*  Knocked on my door [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3048.82s)]
*  She came back to me and what she say and I don't remember because I was distracted by the fact that oh my gosh [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3050.5s)]
*  I have a second chance here. Wow, and so I'm that second chance [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3056.46s)]
*  That's when we moved in together and got married three years later and you didn't mess it up the second time [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3060.14s)]
*  No, no, no [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3064.36s)]
*  And the strength of a marriage is is how how big is that volume because yes [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3066.06s)]
*  They will vary and people will get crabby and people you know, you there are things that will test it, of course [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3071.14s)]
*  What's something that you and your wife like to do together? [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3077.5s)]
*  Is there anything like that you feel like helps keep a marriage together over time? [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3079.42s)]
*  Does there any do things together? Yeah, just add do new things together [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3083.66s)]
*  So that you have a new memory to add to the portfolio [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3086.82s)]
*  If you always do the same old things it can get you know, you see the person every day of your life, right? [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3089.7s)]
*  and so so just make sure it grows have you take do you guys take like classes or is there stuff like [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3094.74s)]
*  Do you? [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3101.4599999999996s)]
*  Just take walks like what are some fun stuff? Yeah, we do take walks in fact [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3102.9399999999996s)]
*  I just take walks with my ex-girlfriend. I liked it. Yeah walks are simple. They're low budget [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3106.9599999999996s)]
*  Step sounds like I'm saving money [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3116.3399999999997s)]
*  Let's go another block it's an incidental fact about it [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3119.8599999999997s)]
*  Not the instrumental fact [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3124.1s)]
*  Hey, baby, I love you because every step is cheap. No, that's not that's not gonna fly. Is that why you're not married yet? [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3128.2599999999998s)]
*  I got a certain best in warm. Here's the thing we all our fairy tales [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3136.8599999999997s)]
*  Do you see the courtship which is over romantic and beautiful and and how do those fairy tales end? What's the final word? [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3140.7799999999997s)]
*  Final phrase the end no before that Oh [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3149.66s)]
*  Happily ever after they live happily ever after wait a minute. Why don't you show me some of that? [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3153.32s)]
*  Give me some hints. How do you pull that one off? Yeah, like Rapunzel they don't show you that she's selling her hair in China [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3160.04s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? They don't [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3167.52s)]
*  Don't show you the odds and ends of that one out [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3169.84s)]
*  So we were trained in the courtship and then we're the Snow White as an opioid [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3173.1200000000003s)]
*  They don't show you some of the truth [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3178.6s)]
*  Dealing with actual life problems and challenges. Yeah, or that uh Goldilocks is in the bestiality [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3184.72s)]
*  They don't show you some of the truth out there Neil [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3191.48s)]
*  Damn, you're right, bro. We just I'm saying they just [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3195.7999999999997s)]
*  Goldilocks is sleeping with the with the Bears, you know, it's whatever [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3199.64s)]
*  I know they don't tell you that she has a crush on Gale Sayers [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3203.08s)]
*  Oh [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3206.68s)]
*  They don't tell you she's out there been running around with Jim McMahon [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3207.88s)]
*  They don't tell you all of that, right? So we have no no [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3211.6s)]
*  Literary life experience even thinking about what happens beyond they lived happily ever after [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3216.88s)]
*  So you have to sort of discover that on your own [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3222.72s)]
*  Is that Ben is it do you feel like is it hard for you to let is it? [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3225.2799999999997s)]
*  This is it just your was it just the brain you were given that made you more scientific? [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3230.36s)]
*  or was it like [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3237.4s)]
*  do you feel like it was a nature or nurture like that you develop that as [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3239.48s)]
*  Because it was a skill that you needed to help process your own like life and childhood [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3244.92s)]
*  That's it's a an important and perceptive question and I have to unpack that because you put a lot in that one [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3250.16s)]
*  Can we talk about that kind of stuff a lot on this show? I'll go there. Let me go there right now. So I [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3255.7599999999998s)]
*  I [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3260.2s)]
*  Everyone wants the secret to things [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3262.3199999999997s)]
*  What's the secret to intelligent a secret to this that implies it's only one thing and not something more complex [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3264.3999999999996s)]
*  And so I remember when I was a kid, this is a slight off-ramp [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3270.2s)]
*  But I hope it's worth it when I was a kiss. It was in seventh grade [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3274.08s)]
*  I did a book report on Ponce de Leon and he's the guide the Spanish explorer who went into South America searching for the fountain of youth [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3277.2799999999997s)]
*  Okay, you drink from it and you have eternal life and I remembered reading that and then I say that idiot [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3286.2400000000002s)]
*  Why would he even think that exists? He's gonna commit an entire voyage to believe that there's just some [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3291.88s)]
*  Elixir coming out of the ground and he lives forever [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3299.36s)]
*  Really a full-grown human being believe this I was thinking to my I was already I was a geeky kid. Okay [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3303.0400000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I'm 12 [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3309.6800000000003s)]
*  I think at this point, but I did the book report on him and then I noticed as I got older [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3311.48s)]
*  This is something deep within us [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3317.68s)]
*  Nobody actually wants to do the hard work to improve their health to live longer healthier lives [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3321.6s)]
*  They want the instant fix. Yeah and [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3328.12s)]
*  Realizing that Ponce de Leon was looking for the fountain of youth [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3331.54s)]
*  Allowed me to see what people were doing [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3334.8s)]
*  I'm old enough to remember yogurt eat yogurt that you live forever Dan and had a commercial with centigenarians eating yogurt [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3338.2599999999998s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I'm her mom would eat the yogurt. I'd be like damn mom's gonna be around but that's what I'm saying [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3344.98s)]
*  So you we're we're we we want there to be quick fixes [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3349.94s)]
*  Yeah things and quick answers and quick solutions. What's the latest that kale kale eat? [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3355.14s)]

*  Because of all the animals that you would eat humans and pigs come closest [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3407.34s)]
*  Yeah, but I can see but it tastes like bacon you have to cure it and do the things whatever but anyhow [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3411.46s)]

*  Otherwise, we will starve to death. I'm eating me some dead humans. That is that is an I'm not thinking [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3431.02s)]

*  Yeah, so no, I wouldn't hesitate I this is not about morals about survival [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3452.02s)]
*  Yeah, so but by the way, if there's a pig over there, I'm eating the pig. I'm not eating the dead human [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3455.7200000000003s)]

*  There's one dude at the plane crash and he just wants to keep [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3473.9s)]
*  Cows and turkeys and chickens, what are you doing? [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3479.54s)]

*  So now I'm completely distracted what the hell was I talking about that [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3496.38s)]
*  I [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3501.06s)]
*  Don't we kind of went out you were talking about, you know, I don't know you started about bacon [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3503.3s)]
*  It's been a long road. I don't know. I has just know we're talking about love love. No, we got off we [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3507.98s)]
*  Okay, we evolved involved [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3514.26s)]
*  Oh, I remember how do I how did it become me? Okay. Okay. Oh, yeah [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3518.1s)]
*  So did this yeah, did you do you think you developed a sense for science out of nature or nurture? So watch so I'm [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3522.2200000000003s)]
*  Walking through life watching people [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3530.98s)]
*  Want to believe that simple things will fix everything. Those are the YouTube [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3533.6200000000003s)]
*  Ads that get your attention [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3541.9s)]
*  You've been doing too many sit-ups. Just do this and you'll have ripped abs [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3544.7400000000002s)]
*  Just eat this drink this and it'll be and you don't have to do any of that work and I thought to myself [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3549.1400000000003s)]
*  There must be something deep within us that just wants to be lazy about [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3555.54s)]
*  What our accomplishments our accomplishments, okay. Yeah, but that's a kind of an off-ramp just to say I [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3560.1s)]
*  Not I don't care about nature or nurture. What I care about is that whatever you are [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3567.46s)]
*  You know [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3573.5s)]
*  You can improve it [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3575.2999999999997s)]
*  You know this [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3577.7s)]

*  You get better at it from trying from practicing in practically [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3582.46s)]
*  Everything we do. So I'm not gonna say nature nurture [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3588.86s)]
*  People say oh, well Michael Phelps [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3593.1s)]
*  He's got really flexed big feet that flap in there for swimming and he can fly me. He's got webbed fingers [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3595.46s)]
*  I don't know. He's a long pig. Okay [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3601.4s)]
*  I don't know, but they'll say whatever they will about his body. But wait a minute [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3603.42s)]
*  He's in the water 30 hours a week. Yeah, did you factor that in? [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3608.78s)]
*  Is that where's that in your equation right for him succeeding how about that? [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3614.18s)]
*  Okay, so [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3620.78s)]
*  Generally you part the curtains someone is working really hard at what might look easy to them that they have accomplished, right? [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3622.86s)]
*  So I don't think that about you. I feel like you've obviously put in the [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3629.54s)]
*  What is it the hours that it takes to have your credibility? [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3634.14s)]
*  So let me get back to your point. So you were a kid wondering. It's very simple. It's very simple [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3637.7400000000002s)]
*  All kids are curious about everything [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3643.2799999999997s)]
*  they overturn rocks and you know poke things and generally create chaos at home and [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3645.6s)]
*  Most of what parents do is they spend the first years of the kids life teaching them to walk and talk [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3652.04s)]
*  Then the rest of life tell them to shut up and sit down [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3657.24s)]
*  Because they're wherever they go. They make a mess but that mess the parents think they're making a mess, but no, they're not [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3660.04s)]
*  These are the results of experiments they've been doing now to discover the operations of nature [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3667.2000000000003s)]
*  If you happen to leave an egg up on the counter and a little toddler and because you're making breakfast and the toddlers reaching up [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3673.76s)]
*  You say no don't touch that [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3679.76s)]
*  And I'm saying no, let him grab it let him [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3681.84s)]
*  What did the egg cost you last? I checked at 40 cents at most watch [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3685.4s)]
*  You know, the egg is gonna end up breaking but so what what's the kids starts playing with the egg? Yeah [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3690.5600000000004s)]
*  And then they do something with it and then it breaks that's interesting [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3696.76s)]
*  Something can be hard [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3700.8s)]
*  Yet fragile. Mmm [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3702.84s)]
*  How many things in life are that most of life eggs are hard? [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3704.92s)]
*  If it no most things are solid this is hard and not fragile but a lot of experiences in the world and stuff [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3710.32s)]
*  I mean well, no that you'd be thinking emotional and I'm talking about physical objects [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3715.42s)]
*  I've got this point. The egg is hard but fragile [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3719.6400000000003s)]
*  Okay, and so that's the learn about that fascinating and it's brittle it doesn't bend it breaks [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3722.52s)]
*  Yeah, okay. So these are structural properties of organic substances [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3728.92s)]
*  All right, and then what's inside? There's this transparent goopy stuff and there's a yellow thing [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3735.2s)]
*  What is that? And then you tell them that might have been a chicken [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3740.44s)]
*  Blow their minds and by the way, you see that [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3746.52s)]
*  Colorless stuff if I heat it it turns white [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3749.36s)]
*  You can watch it change color in front of your eyes [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3753.48s)]
*  There's an this seven science experiments to do with the kid reaching for the egg that you didn't want them to touch and you just [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3756.48s)]
*  Squashed that because you don't want to use the 40 cents. Yeah, you want to have a damn quiche for yourself [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3762.6800000000003s)]
*  Okay [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3767.92s)]
*  The president of Harvard once said when people complained why are you charging so much for edgy? [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3768.32s)]
*  He said if you think the cost of education is high you should try the cost of ignorance [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3772.88s)]
*  That's even higher. Okay. So all I'm saying is [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3778.88s)]
*  That curiosity is beaten out of us by the time we're in middle school [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3783.7200000000003s)]
*  If you retain that curiosity that rampant curiosity [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3787.32s)]
*  You're a scientist. Hmm. A scientist is a kid who grew up physically, but not emotionally not mentally [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3792.52s)]
*  If I see so hey, what is that? Let me poke that let me see what's behind it [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3799.84s)]
*  And it doesn't have to be a physical object. It could be like fictional objects [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3803.44s)]
*  I watched the Thor movie and I'm saying gee, I want to know how I want to help how much of that hammer way [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3807.52s)]
*  I'm still curious. Oh, okay [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3813.12s)]
*  What does that hammer way and I heard a sentence in the movie that enabled me to calculate how much is hammer weighed? Wow [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3815.28s)]
*  They say hammered forged in the heart of a dying star. Oh my gosh. I'm an astrophysicist. We deal in dying stars [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3822.32s)]
*  I got this hide some dense stuff going on in a dying star [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3829.44s)]
*  I filled out the density that and I tweeted it and I said if Thor's hammer is made of [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3833.04s)]
*  in the way the movie says it has the weight of a [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3839.0s)]
*  herd of 300 million elephants, oh [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3844.36s)]
*  That's why nobody could pick it up the Hulk couldn't pick it up. You need the magical powers of Thor to do it [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3847.96s)]
*  So now I saw Lou Freak know at the post office one time who free no original TV [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3853.84s)]
*  Oh, yeah, the original and his wife was making it move boxes around [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3858.36s)]
*  He was all pissed and I'm like you're the frickin hole [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3861.36s)]
*  That's all you know, he's got to be green to do that. Yeah, that's your get with the program [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3866.32s)]
*  He was he was without his paint, but watch what happened. Okay, cuz I'm in the geek averse. Yeah [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3870.56s)]
*  Yeah, I'm thinking yeah, I'm card carry that I'm like nerd alert. I tweeted that out [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3875.08s)]
*  That was like total nerd alert and then I got out nerded. No, oh somebody said [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3878.84s)]
*  Dr. Tyson is wrong about this calculation. Okay, so yeah [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3885.96s)]
*  I got totally smoked on this one. So what happened was in 1991 Marvel issued a Thor's hammer trading card [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3890.54s)]
*  Where they said Thor's hammer is made of a fictional material [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3898.54s)]
*  And it weighs precisely 42.3 pounds. Oh [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3902.66s)]
*  So they kind of cheated they well, yeah [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3906.94s)]
*  yeah, yeah, but but I [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3910.22s)]
*  I'm getting to your earlier point. I wanted my answer to be true, right? I think it's a way better answer [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3913.2599999999998s)]
*  That 42.3 pounds, but it's wrong [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3920.74s)]
*  It's in the canon in the Marvel canon [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3923.82s)]
*  It's just simply wrong and you got to know when to hold them went to went to fold them and went to what's the third one? [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3926.1s)]
*  And when they walk when a walk away when a run I think [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3932.42s)]
*  And that's I think usually out around alimony. Yeah, hold them fold them run. So [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3937.14s)]
*  So that's an example of still being curious into a Dalton and all scientists are like that [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3942.9s)]
*  So no, it's not nurture nature [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3948.94s)]
*  It's did you protect your curiosity in childhood? If not, you'll ossify. I love that word [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3950.98s)]
*  You'll harden in your own beliefs. Mmm, you won't even seek out [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3958.2599999999998s)]
*  Things that might conflict with what you think is true and then because you're comfortable where you are, right? You know what it is [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3963.46s)]
*  We want to be where we are. We want to be it's I hear this [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3971.14s)]
*  Well, yeah, you get you want to yeah you get from a place of like I'm right and it's funny cuz I don't really like [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3973.7s)]
*  Being in that place even there's part of me that does like it because it feels like I'm winning [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3979.2999999999997s)]
*  but there's another part of me that knows it's not helpful to me as a [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3985.42s)]
*  Evolving human which wins [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3991.54s)]
*  Sometimes one wins sometimes the other I think sometimes someone one wins some of the other but I'm grateful that [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3994.2599999999998s)]
*  That I have that I have awareness of both and I do find my awareness half the effort by the way [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=3999.78s)]
*  If you know that this is going on you're there and I'm grateful that the one does does battle a lot of times and say [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4005.6600000000003s)]
*  You know, I know you want to sit right here with this [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4012.02s)]
*  But there's you it's only fair if you look at more to the story [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4015.94s)]
*  I think I told it to myself too. There's a man there's a guy named Walter Badge [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4021.1800000000003s)]
*  I think is his name. I quote him in the book. I think this is the right quote where he said there's no greater pain of the human [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4026.46s)]
*  existence than the prospect of having a new idea [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4034.46s)]
*  Because it would just conflict with what you who you are and how you've defined yourself [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4038.38s)]
*  Yeah, so and why do we want to be why do we want to stay? Why do we want to have that definition? [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4043.0200000000004s)]
*  I think I know why it's comfortable here. It is here it is. You ready? You must have been the worst person in class [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4048.82s)]
*  You must have been [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4053.34s)]
*  Teachers like does anybody have an idea? [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4056.26s)]
*  You must have brought a fake hand [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4060.0200000000004s)]
*  Put it on your desk straight up every time every time so no, I'm so here's what I think is going on. Mm-hmm [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4063.1400000000003s)]
*  You know the Alice Cooper song. I don't know the title of it, but I know the lyric schools have for summer [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4070.7000000000003s)]
*  schools out forever [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4077.38s)]
*  Okay, this is a celebration of not learning [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4079.9s)]
*  And we know people if not ourselves on at the end of the school day [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4086.26s)]
*  we can't wait for the alarm to go off at the end of the day or the Friday comes or [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4090.5200000000004s)]
*  More likely the last day of school and the summer [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4096.3s)]
*  Say schools out and you toss your books in the air and you run down the steps and I'm thinking to myself [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4100.3s)]
*  Your only job was to learn [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4108.14s)]
*  About this beautiful world about this majestic universe and you're [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4111.7s)]
*  Celebrating not learning and so I'm not gonna blame the people [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4116.82s)]
*  I'm gonna blame the school because if I have you for six hours a day and you come out and you'd rather not be there [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4121.0599999999995s)]
*  I have failed not in a literal great sense as a teacher. I have failed the system [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4128.82s)]
*  You know what should be happening in school [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4135.299999999999s)]
*  I shouldn't be loading you with textbooks with with with bold-faced [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4137.18s)]
*  Vocabulary words that you memorize once for the exam before you move on. No, no, no [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4141.580000000001s)]
*  I should figure out a way to make you excited about everything you learn [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4146.14s)]
*  Yeah, so that at the end of the school day, you're sad to walk out of school [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4151.54s)]
*  Imagine the world that would be and you know what schools should do it's not let me load you with knowledge [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4158.900000000001s)]
*  It's let me prepare you to be a lifelong learner [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4165.5s)]
*  So that this curiosity that we have infused in you in kindergarten through 12 or kindergarten through 16 [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4170.02s)]
*  If you're in college there, whatever when you come out [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4177.02s)]
*  That is just the beginning of the flame that will course within you for the rest of your life [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4180.38s)]
*  Because you will spend much more time not in school than you ever did in school. And once again, I'll use the word if you ossify [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4187.1s)]
*  In your knowledge by the getting out of college getting out of high school if that's if that's where you are [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4195.0599999999995s)]
*  You will never grow the world will leave you behind and you'll just be the grumpiest person on the porch [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4202.34s)]
*  Take it off my lawn is what what are these youngins? No, I know because you are comfortable [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4208.179999999999s)]
*  In your ignorance and you don't even know your ignorance because you came to it from from having learned [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4213.9s)]
*  but only up to a point and [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4220.94s)]
*  Without the curiosity you don't keep learning curious. It's all about the curiosity and the ambition you have attached to it [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4223.7s)]
*  It's don't tell me about [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4230.139999999999s)]
*  Nature nurture. I'm not even I'm not even thinking that way [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4232.78s)]
*  Yeah, I think well I grew up in a place, you know, I grew up in a place [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4236.379999999999s)]
*  in Louisiana we had you know, I've talked about this before like the [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4241.099999999999s)]
*  primate testing facility where they [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4246.5s)]
*  Created the polio vaccine was in our town. So Tulane University didn't know that it's a primate testing facility [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4249.14s)]
*  You know in st. Tammany Parish, Louisiana, and I remember [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4255.9s)]
*  One time a bunch of the monkeys had gotten out right and they came and got us out of YMCA summer camp [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4259.5s)]
*  The police did the tallest kids to help them [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4265.18s)]
*  And so we're out there by like the monkeys are on the trees and you got to reach for them [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4267.66s)]
*  Or how do you gonna get a monkeys are just out? Yeah, they wanted like a chain of people I guess. Oh, okay [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4271.58s)]
*  So when the monkeys get out there's no that's that's a scary fact, right? [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4276.98s)]
*  Oh in hindsight knowing now what I know about monkeys and chimpanzees. I think it was a bad idea [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4282.419999999999s)]
*  Oh, okay, but at the time we didn't know so, you know, it was a smaller town then and so we're out there [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4287.0199999999995s)]
*  Just wrangling chimps out by this Kenny Rogers roasters [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4292.66s)]
*  he used to have like a Kenny Rogers had a [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4295.54s)]
*  Chicken establishment for a while and they had like kind of rotisserie chicken. It's pretty good. Yeah, like this cornbread thing. I was pretty good, but [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4297.98s)]
*  But anyway and also in our area [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4304.68s)]
*  That a thing called LIGO LIGO. It was the it's still there. It's um, you know, I'm talking about laser in nephrometry gravitational observatory [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4308.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's only two of them in the well in the United States and Louisiana and I visited that me at Louisiana and up in Oregon [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4315.360000000001s)]
*  I were in Washington Washington. Yeah, so that was another thing in our area [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4322.16s)]
*  So, you know there was a lot of ways just to be clear that is discovering colliding black holes in other [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4325.320000000001s)]
*  Galaxies across the universe. It's a new kind of telescope and you got it there in your home state [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4331.759999999999s)]
*  I knew they were up to something. Oh, yeah, and by the monkeys are running [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4336.28s)]
*  Escape monkeys achieved consciousness and intelligence. I wouldn't be shocked. That's a planet of the ape shit going on [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4341.08s)]
*  I would not be shocked. I've seen some people there that work at some of the gas stations [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4347.12s)]
*  They have a banana for lunch [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4353.04s)]
*  There's some interesting folks there, you know chimpanzees peel the banana from the bottom [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4356.12s)]
*  You know that yeah, you know what my friend does he breaks the banana in half if it's if it's unripe, yeah, that'll work [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4359.88s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. Otherwise you got some mashed banana right there, but we used to hear about um, cuz they were over there hunting grass [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4366.4800000000005s)]
*  All we heard was that they had gravity hunters out there. That's that's a that's a good way [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4373.2s)]
*  That's a poetic way to put it [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4377.4400000000005s)]
*  So that's what we heard and so there'd be people like if you saw somebody that could dance real good [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4378.68s)]
*  You'd say they were like one of those gravity babies or whatever [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4383.0s)]
*  People would have parties and people would say oh, you know [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4386.66s)]
*  We're gonna get so and they would live near there by the in Livingston Parish, Louisiana [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4389.5s)]
*  Where that LIGO Center is and they'd say we're gonna get so fucked up. We can't even feel the gravity. Yeah. Yeah, there it is [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4393.62s)]
*  Yeah, I'd be part of on the Wow zoom in on that. That's great. Yeah. Yeah, so what's going on there if you're listeners have access to this [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4398.8s)]
*  the viewers so those are two long tubes and [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4405.74s)]
*  They send a beam of light from that central building [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4409.32s)]
*  Simultaneously the full length of both tubes and then there are mirrors at the end of those two both tubes and it reflects back [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4413.0199999999995s)]
*  And they recombine the light and if the light recombines perfectly then nothing happened between those two [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4420.86s)]
*  reflections, but if a [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4430.54s)]
*  gravitational wave [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4432.54s)]
*  washes over earth and goes through this facility [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4434.0599999999995s)]
*  One of those beams will be slightly delayed compared to the other [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4438.18s)]
*  They're doing that out there and they can measure it. I know people they can't read out there [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4443.22s)]
*  So they're looking for a variation in a fraction of the diameter of a proton and [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4449.58s)]
*  That is a completely evacuated tube that goes up and back [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4456.42s)]
*  So tell me this so say they find a save the say there's some variation [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4460.74s)]
*  What does that tell them that there's some pull on the earth it tells you that the thing actually happened [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4464.46s)]
*  Einstein predicted the existence of gravitational waves this discovered them [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4470.42s)]
*  6070 years later Wow, okay. No, no more than that. This was [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4475.5s)]
*  2000 when was that this this century Einstein made the prediction in [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4479.62s)]
*  1916 so you're talking basically a hundred years a century. There's a prediction and then a discovery and [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4484.3s)]
*  This is this is ground truth that our ideas actually match [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4490.66s)]
*  Objective reality. Okay, and you want to say well, how does that put food on your plate? [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4495.780000000001s)]
*  It doesn't but it advanced technology in a way that will surely have applications later on [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4499.9400000000005s)]
*  Einstein wrote down the first equation in a paper called on the stimulated emission of radiation [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4506.1s)]
*  obscure quantum physics paper in the 1920s, okay late teens and [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4511.900000000001s)]
*  Why are you doing that? You're a smart guy. Why don't you help put food on people's plates? [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4517.22s)]
*  Why do you know what? That's the foundation of the laser? [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4520.42s)]
*  Which would not be built until the 1950s and and lasers back then were like cost tens of thousands of dollars in their room size [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4523.78s)]
*  Now they're impulse items at at Walmart. Yeah for laser pointers, right? Oh, yeah, but lasers are now, you know barcode now photos [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4531.42s)]
*  Can do it but in their day barcode reading laser surgery lasik surgery for your eyes [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4539.54s)]
*  Laser cosmetics removal so who lasers you put a laser on anything on anything? [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4545.04s)]
*  I do think Einstein saying yes, we're gonna have lasik surgery with this equation that I wrote [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4550.2s)]
*  No, you're not nobody's thinking that so the people say why are we doing this with smart people when they're smart people could be? [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4554.759999999999s)]
*  Solving the homeless because we don't know what the future you don't know what the future somebody might invent a laser that makes homeless people happy [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4560.879999999999s)]
*  Okay [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4567.4400000000005s)]
*  So you don't know what about this though? So say that thing picks up some sort of gravitation wave [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4569.04s)]
*  What does it mean? It means that there's a black hole that's kind of sucking on earth [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4574.92s)]
*  I love it meant two black holes collided and the collision is quite catastrophic and it sends a ripple [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4578.08s)]
*  It's like tossing a pebble in a pond [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4584.08s)]
*  Okay, and you see the ripple go out in all directions get the pond surface is only two is flat in space [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4586.4800000000005s)]
*  This is a ripple that goes through full three dimensions of space [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4593.12s)]
*  And it's moving at the speed of light and it washes over earth at the speed of light [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4597.28s)]
*  And by the way, remember I said make sure you don't think something that's true [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4601.5199999999995s)]
*  That's not or there's that or isn't true that it okay. So [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4606.12s)]
*  Suppose you're just a mischievous graduate student and you're in that facility [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4610.5599999999995s)]
*  See I went I'm gonna tweak this and all everyone else is gonna think they actually discovered something. Okay? Yeah [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4614.68s)]
*  Alright suppose you did suppose you you're diabolical. You're just a prank. Oh, I would do that. Oh, you're just a prankster. Alright [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4621.36s)]
*  We have built-in protections against that. Oh damn [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4627.639999999999s)]
*  We have another one. They got a ring camera. We have an entire other [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4631.2s)]
*  LIGO in [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4635.639999999999s)]
*  Washington Oh making sure yes [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4637.5199999999995s)]
*  Okay, so you would have to coordinate with another but gangster. Yeah to do it at the exact moment [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4640.32s)]
*  Okay, whatever now [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4647.799999999999s)]
*  Okay [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4650.16s)]
*  They both made the measurement but separated by a fraction of a second [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4651.8s)]
*  Just what you'd expect if the wave came from one direction [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4657.84s)]
*  Continues to wash over earth and goes across and comes out Seattle on the other side of the earth [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4662.64s)]
*  Okay, that 1500 miles whatever that distance is it takes like time to do that. They were able to measure that precisely [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4668.92s)]
*  It was good. So tell me about this. So [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4676.04s)]
*  Let's talk about outer space for a second. Yeah, so I'm the guy I'm your guy. Yeah [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4679.160000000001s)]
*  Been in the seat but [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4685.8s)]
*  There aren't that many astrophysicists out there [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4688.240000000001s)]
*  so we have you know, we did have a guy who was a science man recently and he was he uh [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4690.360000000001s)]
*  What he he was in charge of the chronic freezing, you know, there's instant there [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4696.360000000001s)]
*  There's a chronic sensitive to where they freeze people [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4700.52s)]
*  I'm not gonna so I think what'll happen is we'll figure out [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4702.72s)]
*  What ages us and we'll nip-tuck fix that and then who cares about the frozen people at that point [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4708.88s)]
*  We can all just keep living. Oh, I mean, I don't right right. Is it are we gonna need them? That's what I'm saying [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4716.160000000001s)]
*  I don't know. I you know [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4721.240000000001s)]
*  People that want to live forever in the life of the frozen people [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4723.240000000001s)]
*  I [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4726.32s)]
*  Comment on that. Mm-hmm. Do you really want to live? Oh, yeah ever it's a whole thing [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4730.599999999999s)]
*  Because if you live forever [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4735.36s)]
*  What motivation do you have to do anything today? [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4737.36s)]
*  Nothing nothing, but that's what I kind of like about reincarnation [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4740.679999999999s)]
*  It's like when people are doing reincarnation, they're like I'll get to it [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4745.32s)]
*  You know when you believe in reincarnation, yeah, but you you don't know what you'll be right [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4749.48s)]
*  Reincarnation yeah, but you you don't know what you'll be reincarnated as and so you could be reincarnated as a roach or ant or something [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4753.6s)]
*  Yeah, you're hard to fix a shelf as an ant. It's [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4761.400000000001s)]
*  So that's a risky risky business there, but let me lay a little bit of mathematical thinking on you. Okay [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4765.4400000000005s)]
*  For me, there's nothing more [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4772.160000000001s)]
*  motivating [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4775.4800000000005s)]
*  Than the knowledge I'm going to die [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4777.080000000001s)]
*  Mmm think of the prisoner in the cell and they're putting an X through every one because every X is one day closer to getting out [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4779.96s)]
*  Well, let's do that for your life every X you spend doing nothing [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4787.76s)]
*  That's a day you could have done something and you're gonna die one day. Yeah, and it's there on the calendar. Okay [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4792.48s)]
*  This would so motivate me as it does [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4798.8s)]
*  to be as productive as I can as helpful as I can [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4802.5199999999995s)]
*  Try to make a better world for your privilege of having lived in it [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4807.32s)]
*  So if knowing you're gonna die [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4811.16s)]
*  brings meaning to your life [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4814.639999999999s)]
*  Then living forever [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4818.5199999999995s)]
*  Would be is a life of no meaning at all [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4821.24s)]
*  Damn, that's how I think about it. So no, I don't I don't want to live forever [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4823.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think if I got to if I could live forever [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4828.759999999999s)]
*  I'll probably go swim more honestly or do something like, you know that I don't really love doing but I kind of wish I did more [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4830.5199999999995s)]
*  That's a weird. That's a weird wish if I live forever [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4837.36s)]
*  I would swim more even though I don't like it who's so what do you I'll give you another chance answer that again [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4840.599999999999s)]
*  If I could that was a lamest [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4847.919999999999s)]
*  No, if I could live forever, I would do stuff. I didn't really feel like doing [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4851.0s)]
*  Fucking live forever, I don't know what I would do. That's a great question. What would you do if you could live forever? [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4859.5199999999995s)]
*  No, I just say that is the sentence you have to do it. I [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4865.8s)]
*  I don't know. I [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4870.72s)]
*  Don't know cuz so much of how I organize my life is knowing I'm gonna die, right? [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4873.56s)]
*  And I have to think about and get back to you on that. Okay, I'll get back to you on it too [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4878.360000000001s)]
*  Then I hope it's not I'll swim even though I don't like it. That's the lamest no [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4881.96s)]
*  No, okay. I'll try to do better. But I guess that's not that's what I think I would do [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4886.6s)]
*  I know you are clever than that [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4890.360000000001s)]
*  Do we what culture or ethnicity on earth say they're say aliens show up, right is [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4895.88s)]
*  There a society or culture or ethnicity that's best evolved you think to handle it [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4904.16s)]
*  scientists really [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4912.12s)]
*  scientists [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4914.6s)]
*  if an alien came here [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4915.72s)]
*  Theo if it's if an alien landed right in front of us and said to you Theo take me to your leader [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4917.72s)]
*  Are you gonna take him to the White House? [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4922.88s)]
*  No, no, of course not. Are you came to Congress? No, no, that's a great question [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4924.96s)]
*  That's my point to you would take him to well [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4929.84s)]
*  I'm not gonna speak for you, but I happen to be a scientist [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4932.0s)]
*  but if I were not a scientist I would take him to a scientist you would yes a biologist or a [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4936.16s)]
*  Physicist somebody who's by the way say scientists closed that day. Yeah [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4941.92s)]
*  Come back out to lunch come back tomorrow open at 9 in the morning [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4947.36s)]
*  So, you know even science has a sandwich well whoop, where would you take him you speak of science? [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4951.679999999999s)]
*  Like is the one dude behind the counter? [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4957.36s)]
*  Wait, let me finish what happens if you're trying to talk to him. Okay, my point is [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4965.12s)]
*  Mathematics I give him a treat first. I think you'd have to treat they're not a pet [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4970.16s)]
*  They just flew here in a ship way more advanced than anything we've ever conceived. Okay here [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4974.599999999999s)]
*  Here's a chew toy [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4980.26s)]
*  Be the first human zapped by an alien laser [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4985.38s)]
*  You hit him with that snicker [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4990.22s)]
*  Then your friend forever [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4993.66s)]
*  Steven Spielberg where they're eating what do they eat the Reese's pieces? [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=4999.38s)]
*  Oh, yeah, oh he'd bring his friends next week now you give a Reese's to an alien it's gonna get diabetes [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5003.38s)]
*  How do you know it can handle? [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5010.26s)]
*  Now he's stuck [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5015.78s)]
*  Lazy on earth that has to be a movie right? [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5020.78s)]
*  I don't know but okay. So he's here. What do you do? What I'm saying is that I [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5023.06s)]
*  Have a periodic table of elements that are elements across the universe [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5030.26s)]
*  I know mathematics that and laws of physics that apply across the universe [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5034.0199999999995s)]
*  They got here from across the universe. So those those laws would be totally the same when they're playing totally the same [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5038.46s)]
*  So if you're gonna start with a language like well, this is a cup and this is a fork and this is it [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5044.04s)]
*  It's like this is our elements and this is what we call this aluminum [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5049.3s)]
*  We call this and they will know and they start to develop a common vocabulary [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5052.98s)]
*  So that you can communicate with them because they're not gonna speak English nor French nor Mandarin none of the above [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5057.299999999999s)]
*  That being said if they send radio signals here, the largest radio telescope is gonna pick it up first [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5064.339999999999s)]
*  And you know where that is? [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5070.7s)]
*  Hold on. Let me think Arizona. It was once in on American soil in Puerto Rico the the Arcebo telescope [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5072.7s)]
*  But that collapsed out of disuse and okay, the largest radio telephone world is in China [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5079.7s)]
*  Wow, so the first humans that will hear here the signal sent by aliens will be Chinese astrophysicists [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5084.98s)]
*  But we're talking about if they visit so if they visit I'm saying bring them to a scientist [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5093.38s)]
*  The scientists will know how to think about and pose questions to them [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5097.94s)]
*  for this for this reason and I got a little dust up when I saw the movie arrival and [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5101.82s)]
*  Aliens visit and they park these pods floating over there. And so the government gets two people they get a a [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5107.42s)]
*  linguist and a [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5114.7s)]
*  physicist [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5117.0199999999995s)]
*  To decode there and I'm thinking no no you get a cryptographer and an [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5118.22s)]
*  Astrobiologist that's what you want to do [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5125.58s)]
*  I don't if you saw the movie the alien is like a septipod looks like an octopus, but it was only seven things and it's squid inking [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5127.62s)]
*  Messages on a on a glass. It's underwater or wherever it medium it's in and so well, there it goes. Okay [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5134.98s)]
*  Your boy brought it up on the on the on the screen got it right here. Okay arrival. Yeah. Yes arrival [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5142.62s)]
*  diplomacy scene [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5149.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, so we're trying to find out what are they trying to say to us and why and so I would have brought a cryptographer and [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5149.66s)]
*  an [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5156.219999999999s)]
*  Astrobiologist, but they brought a was it a linguist a [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5157.219999999999s)]
*  Cultural linguist and a non English linguist. It was a little could you look that up real quick? [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5161.62s)]
*  the the profession of the woman that [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5167.34s)]
*  Was she hot too [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5170.26s)]
*  You got to bring a hottie out of an alien shows [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5173.38s)]
*  She was a what yeah, she was a linguist [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5178.82s)]
*  Okay, so so they have a linguist and a physicist physicist is good [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5181.139999999999s)]
*  But not as good as a cryptographer who's trying to figure out right the hell they're saying so I posted that and I shouldn't have [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5185.3s)]
*  that should have been my forbidden Twitter file because no because [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5191.0199999999995s)]
*  My people are in movies all the time right we have astrophysicists all how often is a linguist in a movie? [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5195.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah, all right, and I was there one there one chance and I felt bad [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5201.9400000000005s)]
*  Burnham I throw some shade on there on there. But now what about this? [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5207.14s)]
*  So tell me this what the Chinese so the Chinese would be the first people to know that no no to hear a signal [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5210.820000000001s)]
*  Okay, that's come. Do you think that they would tell the rest of us or not? [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5216.22s)]
*  Probably not initially but but eventually no no the thing is why should they they they built their own damn telescope [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5219.06s)]
*  That telescope is a mile in circumference. By the way, I want to get a sense of how big it is [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5225.780000000001s)]
*  It's called the fast telescope 500 meter aperture spherical telescope [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5230.34s)]
*  Acronym fast, but if they know when they don't tell us man [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5235.54s)]
*  Then they get to they can [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5239.38s)]
*  They can have a whole pack they say we are the chosen ones and everyone else on earth isn't [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5242.42s)]
*  Send your rate ray beams to you know, I don't know what they're gonna do [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5246.58s)]
*  But there it is. We have another [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5250.42s)]
*  We're fucked [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5252.42s)]
*  Looking at the image on the screen I was that visited that we filmed there for cosmos. Oh my gosh [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5257.3s)]
*  Oh, you got to hold on to that footage [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5264.1s)]
*  Oh my god, we got to make this why are we why don't we have anything like that? [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5266.1s)]
*  Because we are not we'd like to think of ourselves that we're Americans and we're leaders [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5270.1s)]
*  We've over history we've been reactive [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5274.74s)]
*  To challenges from other countries not proactive and what are we now as far as when it comes to challenges from outer space [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5277.62s)]
*  We have we have nothing that rivals that wow at all [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5283.7s)]
*  So when it comes to space, we're not really the number one. No, no in in space in access to space [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5287.38s)]
*  Plus you have the billionaires boys race that's up there, you know [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5292.66s)]
*  And by the way, there's a whole chapter in here called earth and moon where I just talk about [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5295.219999999999s)]
*  The relationship between earth and the moon and going to the moon [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5300.820000000001s)]
*  How we went to the moon to explore the moon and we looked over our shoulder [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5304.18s)]
*  And we discovered earth for the first time. Hmm, and it changed us [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5309.22s)]
*  Between 1968 and 1972. Do you know what happened? [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5314.18s)]
*  We saw the picture of earth rise over the moon and I claimed that there was a firmware upgrade [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5318.74s)]
*  to our awareness [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5325.22s)]
*  In this universe because what happened immediately [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5327.62s)]
*  By 1970 we founded the environmental protection agency the national oceanic and atmospheric administration that monitors climate and weather [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5331.06s)]
*  We had the comprehensive clean air act clean water act. We banned leaded gas. We banned ddt [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5339.14s)]
*  The first earth day [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5346.1s)]
*  Was 1970 earth day was pretty chill. Okay, it's chill. Yeah, but if you ask any of them [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5348.66s)]
*  Well, why you have earth day now? [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5352.820000000001s)]
*  Well, because it's the right thing to do. This is the firmware upgrade. They're not thinking space, right? They're just thinking obvious [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5354.82s)]
*  We should no, you know what else was going on in 1970? We were war hot war cold war campus unrest [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5360.179999999999s)]
*  Civil rights movement in 1968 two leaders were assassinated [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5366.74s)]
*  1971 was it was the shootings on kent state campus. We had issues here on earth [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5372.259999999999s)]
*  Don't tell me oh it felt like the right time to protect earth [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5378.58s)]
*  We had other issues something else was operating in your brainstem [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5382.02s)]
*  That you knew weren't even aware of that's the that's the firmware upgrade. Do you remember? [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5386.18s)]
*  You would have seen videos of it the crying indian. Yeah, okay [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5390.660000000001s)]
*  People throw trash out the window and he turns around and he tears and he's in headdress. Of course. That dude was was italian [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5393.9400000000005s)]
*  Who's an italian actor? Yeah, he was italian italian heritage. So so back then you can do that, right? [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5400.26s)]
*  Right, you could do that back then but my point is [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5406.580000000001s)]
*  People were people throwing trash out the window for decades [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5409.46s)]
*  So something at that point upgrade made us think we got to start looking at this place that we're on [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5412.02s)]
*  You know what? That's called a cosmic perspective [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5416.74s)]
*  Now what about this do you think we are due for other firmware upgrades? [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5421.14s)]
*  I would like to think so a former upgrade where we stopped killing each other. Yeah, you think [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5424.02s)]
*  You know, there's no greater [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5430.02s)]
*  Argument someone gives for killing someone else than what they believe in rather than what is actually true [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5432.820000000001s)]
*  It's almost like the less evidence you have for something [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5439.620000000001s)]
*  The more you're willing to give your own life or to take someone else's life for it [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5442.740000000001s)]
*  And that's some weird stuff for a species weird behavior pattern for a species [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5448.34s)]
*  So that's what we're talking about [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5454.18s)]
*  And that's some weird stuff for a species weird behavior pattern for now [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5456.820000000001s)]
*  The world is a much safer place than ever before [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5462.9800000000005s)]
*  Here's a number to sleep on you ready? Yeah [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5467.860000000001s)]
*  Probably we live in a time where if a bus drives into a crowd of protesters, you know [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5470.820000000001s)]
*  Kills 10 people [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5475.860000000001s)]
*  That's world headlines [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5477.54s)]
*  for a day [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5479.62s)]
*  It's national headlines [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5481.14s)]
*  For a week it's local headlines for a month, okay kills 10 people [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5483.780000000001s)]
*  Between 1939 and 1945 [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5490.660000000001s)]
*  1000 humans were killed per hour of every hour between 1939 and 1945 [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5495.6s)]
*  That doesn't happen today when yes, we have war we have conflict people are dying it's not like that not like that [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5507.22s)]
*  It is not like that [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5513.54s)]
*  And not long before that there was another world war [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5515.780000000001s)]
*  Plus a pandemic on top of it that ultimately killed more people than the world war did [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5519.62s)]
*  So less people are dying [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5524.900000000001s)]
*  Yes, we have more people and fewer people are dying and fewer people are living in poverty than ever before [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5526.660000000001s)]
*  okay, and [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5533.46s)]
*  so [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5536.18s)]
*  Yeah, so we have about eight billion people in the world [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5537.62s)]
*  We'll level off at 10 billion. They're very good reasons to think that that it won't go above 10 billion [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5540.9800000000005s)]
*  It's not it's not going to keep growing. Yeah, because people aren't having as many children [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5546.26s)]
*  They're not having as many children. We're living longer so that's mitigates that but then not having as many children [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5548.900000000001s)]
*  And the developed worlds developing worlds [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5554.34s)]
*  That used to have the most babies the women are getting educated and educated women have fewer children [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5557.38s)]
*  Yeah [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5564.42s)]
*  It's true man. They were just running is that how you say that? I didn't know that was a way to say that [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5566.26s)]
*  That's a new way. I never thought of saying it [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5570.5s)]
*  Man [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5574.26s)]
*  This black hole is closed [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5575.38s)]
*  No more kids well in the day you'd have to take that you have many kids kids would kids would die [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5578.820000000001s)]
*  Right, you didn't you'd want to run the farm or whatever you're doing, right? [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5584.02s)]
*  So now they don't die we keep them alive. And so you know, so the birth rates are dropping [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5586.660000000001s)]
*  Even in the developing comes and in some countries the birth rate is below replacement level [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5591.700000000001s)]
*  So this all averages out and we'll settle out at about 10 billion [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5596.0199999999995s)]
*  but what my point is [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5600.74s)]
*  We live in sort of safer times than ever before even if it doesn't feel that way interesting [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5603.3s)]
*  You were talking about feeling before uh, was it gallop or or or one of the polling agencies for the last 30 years? [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5607.94s)]
*  They ask people [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5614.099999999999s)]
*  Is your community and your is it are you safer this year than you were last year? No, it's more dangerous [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5615.78s)]
*  It's fear for 27 out of 30 years [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5621.78s)]
*  People have said it's more dangerous than the previous year [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5625.14s)]
*  and [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5628.9s)]
*  In those years the crime rate has dropped precipitously the entire time. So there's slang and fear [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5630.42s)]
*  That's what sells evening news really does evening news and I have a I have an example on this when I grew up [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5636.74s)]
*  Every night I grew up in new york city every night the evening news would lead off with a fire [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5643.7s)]
*  in some home [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5649.7s)]
*  Usually it's a space heater those little space heater back then people smoked in bed. Okay, okay [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5651.62s)]
*  And it was before that's great and it was before it's fun to do but smoke alarms. Yeah, okay [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5657.0599999999995s)]
*  And by the way, I got something funny for you. I'll just tell you just in a quick minute, but the point is [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5663.54s)]
*  I was certain I would die in a fire [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5669.0599999999995s)]
*  I would never live to adulthood because I saw that every single day [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5671.46s)]
*  And so [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5675.62s)]
*  Now there are fewer fires because we have smoke. Yeah, there's a few and they make big news, but the rate compared back then [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5676.58s)]
*  New york has fewer fire houses. We've been closing fire houses. You just don't need them [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5682.82s)]
*  But it's more boring though. And by the way, what really saved things are smoke detectors because i'm old enough to remember [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5687.46s)]
*  You might be a little too young for this [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5693.78s)]
*  Where before smoke detectors you had to buy flame retardant things in your home. Your curtains were flame retardant your [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5695.62s)]
*  Your your child had flame retardant [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5702.9800000000005s)]
*  onesies, yeah, really okay [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5707.36s)]
*  And but if you think that through [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5710.02s)]
*  If they're in the crib and the flame is strong enough [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5712.82s)]
*  It's not gonna help to burn their onesies. You don't want the onesies to ignite your kid is dead. Oh, yeah [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5717.86s)]
*  Long dead. It's almost like when you get the hash brown, but it's in that little thing, you know [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5724.18s)]
*  I [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5728.66s)]
*  Don't know if it's exactly like that, but I know I know exactly what you're talking about [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5730.179999999999s)]
*  Where's the potato if the whole thing is brown is hash brown, okay [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5735.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know if I need this little holster for like I just you know, okay. So [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5739.86s)]
*  so [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5745.54s)]
*  Uh, so my my point is [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5746.179999999999s)]
*  This flame and we later learned some of them cause cancer [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5748.58s)]
*  That's not what kept people alive [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5751.86s)]
*  Ultimately is the smoke is the smoke detector [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5753.94s)]
*  Wow, um, but where was I going with that? I was at some bigger point I was making well [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5756.42s)]
*  I think things like that take the fun out of everything, you know, they used to have these um, oh [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5760.5s)]
*  No, we're talking about crime rates. Oh, so everyone thought the crime rate was going up [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5765.22s)]
*  It's been going down the whole time. Your perception is not reality. Oh, yeah, and that's a lot of what this book [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5768.18s)]
*  It's the whole the whole book is that um [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5773.22s)]
*  Oh, I remember we had these underwears that had a buzzer in them right because I wet the bed right so it's probably [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5777.06s)]
*  Probably late 20s and we had these underwear when I was a child that got a buzzer right in the didn't know that [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5783.06s)]
*  Yeah, so the pee would would would you lick would hit it? [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5789.78s)]
*  They'd go off and you'd wake up and you go to the bathroom. Yeah, didn't know they had that [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5792.42s)]
*  I mean it was interesting it helped [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5797.22s)]
*  I mean it was embarrassing because you had to like lie to people what the buzzer was right? [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5799.22s)]
*  Like are the cops coming? [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5803.3s)]
*  You'd have to run off and pee. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. But like did it work is something in the oven? [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5805.62s)]
*  Like 4 a.m [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5810.42s)]
*  You tell your friends like I think something's in the oven sleepovers are awkward [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5811.54s)]
*  Right. So does it did it work for you? It worked pretty good [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5814.9800000000005s)]
*  I think and then a pill came out and that really I think the pill was it yeah [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5818.02s)]
*  I mean that shut me better living through chemistry. We are sacks of chemicals [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5821.46s)]
*  Yeah, and the evidence of that is you ever seen the book of medicines? [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5824.9800000000005s)]
*  to [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5829.06s)]
*  Treat your ailments. It's all chemicals [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5830.34s)]
*  Yeah, i'm just saying we're sacks of chemicals. Yeah, that's what helped [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5832.82s)]
*  Um, so you wet the bed until your 20s. Oh, yeah, that's late, dude [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5836.1s)]
*  Oh, I was late. I'm gonna late. You gotta set up a hose or something. Oh, dude my whole life [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5839.7s)]
*  I've been a late bloomer. Wait, wait, so in your not to get all tmi here, but uh [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5844.5s)]
*  When you were peeing in the bed, were you dreaming that you were peeing in a bathroom? Sometimes I would be dreaming that I was peeing [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5850.26s)]
*  Sometimes I would even be dreaming that I was peeing in a bed [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5856.82s)]
*  You know, it was like my brain couldn't give me that's an authentic reality. Yeah [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5859.86s)]
*  I couldn't give me any more clues. Okay, but sometimes yeah, I would just be just deep asleep. I don't know [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5863.0599999999995s)]
*  But I would yeah, I just [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5870.099999999999s)]
*  I just wet the bed man. I wet it as a child and I wet it as an adult [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5872.34s)]
*  um [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5877.54s)]
*  You turned out okay, though. Yeah, I think i'm just a late bloomer man [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5878.82s)]
*  Everything has been about 10 years. Okay, that's fine. You know, okay with that. Um [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5883.0599999999995s)]
*  Why does it feel so much when I look at outer when I look at space, right? [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5888.099999999999s)]
*  I'm standing there. I'm looking out at space [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5891.86s)]
*  By the way, if you're in space and your jet pack stopped working if you pee forward you'll you'll move backwards that much [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5893.7s)]
*  Well in space any propulsion works because there's no friction anywhere [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5900.42s)]
*  So if you send any liquid out for you could fart the other direction and you'll propel backward [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5905.0599999999995s)]
*  So don't pee and fart at the same time. You lose a gang bang. No, no, no, you lose your your net momentum [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5910.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you just stay there. So choose are you gonna fart or you're gonna pee? Okay, and we're good like yeah [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5915.54s)]
*  I wasted all my fuel [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5919.86s)]
*  What if um, no that's advice i'm pretty sure you didn't think you'd be getting today [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5923.78s)]
*  I didn't at all right, but i'm glad to know that [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5927.7s)]
*  Take a can of beans if you're headed out on the beach [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5930.34s)]
*  Um [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5933.94s)]
*  By the way, you know the swamis that they all show pictures of who are levitated with their cross legs. Um [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5934.98s)]
*  So [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5942.26s)]
*  You can't do that unless [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5943.22s)]
*  He is actively expelling gas out of his butthole [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5945.3s)]
*  Okay, so you'd have to like eat a lot of beans and sew up the butthole to get very high pressure [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5948.5s)]
*  Damn and then pop it open and then he can levitate. Wow. Yeah, so they're yeah, so that's that's definitely [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5953.38s)]
*  Advertising that they're using that they're obviously well, no i'll say they're completely defying known laws of physics [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5959.84s)]
*  So nobody can really levitate like that. No one has ever done that [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5965.7s)]
*  In a controlled laboratory. Okay, so if they can do it, there's some magic that they do [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5969.62s)]
*  And okay, it's not useful if I can't reproduce it in the lab [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5975.06s)]
*  Uh under controlled conditions with cameras and everything. It's just not useful. Yeah, and it's so magic isn't real [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5980.02s)]
*  um [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5988.58s)]
*  No, well, you know the arthur c clark edict [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5990.34s)]
*  any sufficiently advanced [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5993.7s)]
*  science [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5996.34s)]
*  Is indistinguishable from magic? [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=5998.02s)]
*  That's a good one [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6001.14s)]
*  Okay [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6002.42s)]
*  So if an alien comes up and then waves their hand and something happens you'll say it's magic but to them it's science [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6003.62s)]
*  It's just super science, correct. In fact, I I I tell you I don't mean to brag or anything [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6009.06s)]
*  You do magic. No, I did when I was a kid. I can see that I did physics magic. I'd pull the the the [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6013.860000000001s)]
*  Table clock out from under I still do that. It's fun. Yeah. Yeah, and I did some hard tricks risky [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6019.14s)]
*  Yeah, I have large hands so I can palm a card pretty easily. Oh, damn [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6023.46s)]
*  So so I did that as a kid. I made money at kids birthday parties. I think I was 12 or something [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6027.3s)]
*  Doing it for six-year-olds. What was your first job? [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6033.38s)]
*  Oh, I was a camp counselor and I worked whole summer and I made 150 for ymca [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6036.740000000001s)]
*  Uh, it was a version of that. Yes. It was some other thing but it was through through a church thing [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6042.660000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I went to ymca camp. It was fun. Yeah [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6049.06s)]
*  Yeah, and then I went to well before then I went to camp. I was in a ymca camp several years in a row [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6051.06s)]
*  Camp was fun. Yeah. No, it's good. It was good. It was good [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6055.620000000001s)]
*  So but but let me tell you the job I hated the most [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6058.740000000001s)]
*  Just just the whole optics of it [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6062.02s)]
*  I got to college [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6064.660000000001s)]
*  And I i'm on a work study program [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6066.660000000001s)]
*  But the the work part was like whatever job you can get that and that was contributed to your tuition [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6068.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, same. I had to be in the bookstore. Well, no now fine if it was a bookstore, but not the job I got [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6074.9800000000005s)]
*  Okay, I cleaned [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6080.1s)]
*  the bathrooms [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6082.5s)]
*  In the dorms of other students [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6084.820000000001s)]
*  Probably just all semen in there [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6089.06s)]
*  So [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6091.06s)]
*  I mean not you know [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6093.46s)]
*  So i'm just saying just the just the [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6096.1s)]
*  Out of my cleaning bathrooms, you know [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6098.820000000001s)]
*  But i'm doing it for fellow students who i'm i'm gonna see in my physics class [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6101.06s)]
*  Or in my art class, right? And it was it was just [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6106.660000000001s)]
*  I did it [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6111.38s)]
*  But I just thought they'd need a different way to work this out. Yeah [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6112.660000000001s)]
*  Okay [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6117.22s)]
*  and so [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6118.820000000001s)]
*  um [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6120.34s)]
*  Yeah, but it puts you through college and you get through college and there was that [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6121.54s)]
*  You earned your stripes, man. I'll say you went through. I mean you but but you know what I regret i've never had a job [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6126.02s)]
*  Where I had to tolerate [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6133.62s)]
*  The behavior of someone else [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6136.1s)]
*  Like a checkout counter or a server at a restaurant [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6138.1s)]
*  or a flight attendant i've never had to [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6142.82s)]
*  tolerate [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6146.56s)]
*  Someone being a complete asshole and smile while you're doing it because corporate policy says the customer is always right [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6147.78s)]
*  I've never had to do that. Oh, that's everybody at a cvs now. I feel like they have to put up with everything now [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6154.74s)]
*  Yeah, so I so that's interesting. I try to be empathetic even though i've never seen that recognize that yeah [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6160.5s)]
*  Oh my gosh, that's usually is kind of an important job to have. Yeah, um [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6165.78s)]
*  Is outer space like is outer space gay or straight? [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6170.42s)]
*  Uh, so there's an entire chapter here called gender and identity [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6174.5s)]
*  Okay, uh-huh i'm just putting it out there okay gender it's an entire chapter what that looks like [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6182.9800000000005s)]
*  Through a scientific lens and what I will tell you is [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6188.660000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I remember you talking about the facial structure [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6192.9800000000005s)]
*  Okay, so i'm going to give you an answer are you ready? Yeah, is outer space gay or straight? [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6196.26s)]
*  Gay or straight? [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6200.66s)]
*  Every practically everything [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6204.18s)]
*  We see and measure in space [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6206.82s)]
*  not only objects but [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6210.82s)]
*  temperature size [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6213.0599999999995s)]
*  density [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6215.46s)]
*  Is on a spectrum [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6217.78s)]
*  So for you to say is the universe gay or straight? [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6220.34s)]
*  I'm going to tell you whatever the universe is it's on a spectrum [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6223.62s)]
*  In fact the very word spectrum comes from what happens when you take light and break it up into its colors [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6226.74s)]
*  We just happen to assign names to the seven colors [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6233.3s)]
*  Red orange yellow green blue indigo violet, but it's an it's a continuum [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6237.94s)]
*  We're just being lazy by assigning seven colors. Our brain doesn't want to see nuance [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6242.74s)]
*  Because it's easier for us to think in binary [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6248.66s)]
*  So it's are you with me or are you against me? Well, maybe you're somewhere in between [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6252.34s)]
*  Are you a boy? Are you a girl? Maybe they're expressing themselves somewhere in between and your brain [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6256.9s)]
*  Has a difficult time [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6263.94s)]
*  Recognizing a spectrum and so you're requiring it be into a bin. So there you are [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6267.12s)]
*  Forcing other people to match how you see the world and that's wrong [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6273.38s)]
*  That's no i'm not let me not say it's wrong. I'm going to say [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6279.139999999999s)]
*  um [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6282.82s)]
*  The world is not gonna change to fit your inability to recognize how it's actually manifesting [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6283.62s)]
*  It's not gonna do that [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6290.82s)]
*  So so it's bi [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6292.74s)]
*  No, it's on a continuum [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6295.38s)]
*  So whatever it is you can say is is is the universe sweet or salty? [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6297.3s)]
*  Is the universe whatever it is you're asking me is it this or is it that? [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6302.66s)]
*  That's the binary brain trying to force a continuum into two categories. So it's like checks mix [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6307.62s)]
*  Except with more objects more kinds of objects than what you find in check checks mix has like five things in it [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6313.62s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. Okay, imagine if checks mix had everything [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6318.74s)]
*  In a continuum that it kept changing now. Now look at how our brain works. We have hurricane strengths, right? [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6322.82s)]
*  Oh, yeah, they measure the wind speed [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6328.18s)]
*  Do you realize it's a continuum? [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6330.98s)]
*  But we we divided it into five categories, right? But it's a continuum [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6333.46s)]
*  Do you realize you can go from low category three to high category three? [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6338.9s)]
*  And it's and they'll just talk about our hurricane irma is still a category three [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6343.86s)]
*  One mile an hour faster [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6348.98s)]
*  And it's category four. It's breaking news. Oh, yeah hurricane. Irma is now [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6351.14s)]
*  category four [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6356.16s)]
*  Excuse me. It's one mile an hour faster than it was yesterday. Yeah, people lie. They say the winds broken [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6357.94s)]
*  Okay, so i'm just saw the winds making a bowl of cereal some guys [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6363.62s)]
*  That's funny, that's funny. So my point is even with hurricane speed strengths [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6368.099999999999s)]
*  We force them into categories when it's actually a continuum. I see [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6373.62s)]
*  So it's a continuum out there. So [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6378.0199999999995s)]
*  So because it looks kind of gay I feel like but then sometimes it does things that seem really straight [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6380.26s)]
*  But those are also my definitions of those correct. You're forcing the universe into your two categories, right? [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6385.46s)]
*  I think what's tough I think for people just in layman's terms [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6390.74s)]
*  Is when you have a template of society over time and the and things start to come in and make it evolve or adjust [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6393.94s)]
*  It's hard sometimes to get those things all the way to the grassroots level [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6400.82s)]
*  I would claim that the template was always people forcing [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6404.5s)]
*  A natural variation into categories. Ah, do you know jonahvar? [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6408.5s)]
*  You remember she was remember you read she was burned at the stake. Yeah, yeah, 1400. Was she doing witchery? [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6412.82s)]
*  Okay. Well, okay. That would be one way you would burn people at the stake but [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6418.9s)]
*  They couldn't burn her at the stake for not being religious. She was very religious [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6424.02s)]
*  She was trying to kick the british out of france her mother country she led soldiers into battle. Wow, do you know [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6427.299999999999s)]
*  half I don't know if it was half precisely but a big reason why they [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6435.139999999999s)]
*  Indicted her and burned her at the stake was for cross-dressing [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6439.7s)]
*  And I look there's a there's a passage in the bible in deuteronomy you ready? [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6443.86s)]
*  It's if a woman donned the clans the clothes. This is very close to precise if the woman dons the clothes of a man [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6447.299999999999s)]
*  She is an abomination unto the lord thy god [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6454.66s)]
*  Oh man, and so they said we can get her on that they're like looking trying to throw the book at her, right? [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6457.62s)]
*  We got her on this because you can't lead soldiers into battle with a skirt riding side saddle [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6462.42s)]
*  Yeah, that does not work. No, you got to put on at least a strong hat at the earth [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6468.099999999999s)]
*  So is she an early person who's just a tomboy? Yeah, who's who's expressing herself in male though? She's [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6471.86s)]
*  Biologically female. Oh, she'd have been in a league of their own probably. Okay, so [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6478.4s)]
*  We know yeah grown up [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6483.379999999999s)]
*  In classes where there was the tomboy girl and the slightly effeminate boy [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6486.42s)]
*  We we if not ourselves [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6491.379999999999s)]
*  This has been with us forever. Yeah, it's in literature and it's in the thing [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6494.0199999999995s)]
*  And the difference between then and now [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6499.54s)]
*  Is we have a raised social consciousness so that those folks? [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6502.259999999999s)]
*  On the continuum are are less so the object of mockery [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6507.299999999999s)]
*  In storytelling, they're just other characters now [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6512.66s)]
*  And there's still more room to improve that but i'm saying [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6515.94s)]
*  um the [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6520.74s)]
*  You have people who are trans people who are who are uh, uh full up trans or just simply wearing clothes [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6522.259999999999s)]
*  That are the not what you want them to wear based on what you think they should be [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6528.98s)]
*  Yeah, is that a free country if this is what what concerns me a bit a lot of the resistance to this comes from the conservative [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6533.139999999999s)]
*  Side of the voting public and they're trying to [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6540.2s)]
*  Control [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6545.14s)]
*  The freedoms of people's expressing themselves in some way I read [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6546.6s)]
*  That the pursuit of happiness did we read this somewhere in the founding documents? [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6551.400000000001s)]
*  And if my pursuit of happiness is wearing a skirt and putting on makeup and lipstick [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6557.08s)]
*  No matter whether or not I have a penis [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6561.56s)]
*  um [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6564.4400000000005s)]
*  You want to take that away from me? [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6565.96s)]
*  Why [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6568.92s)]
*  That is it's in a way. That's a violation of what it means to live in a free country [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6570.28s)]
*  Yeah, I think people just accuse you a gay and or whatever they accuse you like queer and the fact that it would be an accusation [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6574.6s)]
*  At all rather than a recognition that there are people different from you who live in this free country [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6580.04s)]
*  Well, look i'll tell you this a lot of times i've been around a lot of like sometimes a lot of drunk men [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6585.56s)]
*  You know and I don't drink [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6590.04s)]
*  But i'll get around them sometimes and you can see they start wanting to [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6591.72s)]
*  You know they start you know, their lips get a little wet and you see them wanting to be you know [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6596.04s)]
*  You see their their their guards are yeah, you see the god melting down. Okay guards on lunch break [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6602.04s)]
*  And some of the guy's wife will be i'm like what the fuck what is even going on [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6610.92s)]
*  But you see him with the eyeballs start getting a little wandering [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6615.0s)]
*  So I think you know if we were honest with ourselves, it wouldn't even be a problem if we were honest with it centuries ago [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6617.8s)]
*  Well, yeah, there's probably just old and also some of it is templates some of it is tradition [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6623.88s)]
*  And people want to like people worry I think it's too much if you lose [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6628.4400000000005s)]
*  Like and i'm not saying they're correct traditions, but I think a lot of people worry if you lose tradition [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6632.2s)]
*  Then what does that mean? [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6637.16s)]
*  I think you know, I think we're still evolving in a way that we want to look at [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6638.68s)]
*  at [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6643.64s)]
*  Existence in a larger scale and not just in the scope of our own [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6644.76s)]
*  I'm a big fan of traditions and let's call them rituals for the moment. Okay [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6649.24s)]
*  A thanksgiving dinner is a ritual the the traditions and rituals in and of themselves. I [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6653.16s)]
*  Greatly value them. They become they're some of the greatest [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6658.92s)]
*  Binding forces in a culture are traditions. Yeah, okay in Passover the jew the the observant jews of the world are all doing the same thing [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6662.92s)]
*  basically at the same time relative to the sunset, okay, and so [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6672.280000000001s)]
*  That's a binding force. But if your tradition is not [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6676.84s)]
*  The celebration but what you look like what you sound like what you say how would you think then that's [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6680.76s)]
*  That those are traditions trying to [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6687.16s)]
*  Remove freedoms that your country might otherwise be giving you. Yeah, and so it come from [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6689.96s)]
*  Traditions. Yeah, they kept tribes together. Oh my gosh [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6695.78s)]
*  Where does the other stuff to come from like you're the like where does it but I think it maybe it feels like [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6698.68s)]
*  I'm trying to decide what that feels like to people that makes them [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6705.4s)]
*  So commonly that those are things that are hung on to you know [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6710.76s)]
*  Uh, well if they it's one thing because you have your own ritual, okay [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6715.4800000000005s)]
*  I used to always have candles for dinner. Okay, I blow through yards of candles [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6719.32s)]
*  Oh, I bet you did. It's a romantic and I'd like a bottle of wine and my wife [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6724.28s)]
*  No, no, I and so but so for me that was a little bit ritual my mother [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6728.52s)]
*  Burned candles and she was catholic and candles are a thing in a catholic church. Oh, yeah [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6732.6s)]
*  You know up in there. Yeah, so I and the candles are burning during the mass [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6737.0s)]
*  So I a little bit of candle worked into me, but i'm not that's nice [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6740.68s)]
*  I'm not forcing someone to do something with the candle, right? Okay, i'm not forcing someone else to pray to the candle [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6744.76s)]
*  I'm not trying to change the behavior of someone else. It's just something I do and I do it [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6750.84s)]
*  All right. It's when you cross over and require other people recognize this. Yeah [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6755.64s)]
*  Or or you require other people abandon it just because you don't want it [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6762.04s)]
*  That's not a free country. That's all i'm saying you can imagine a country where everyone is homogenized in whatever way you want [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6766.84s)]
*  Those those countries exist. I didn't think that was america. Yeah, I didn't say that right. I didn't think it was merck [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6773.320000000001s)]
*  I think it was america merck merck. Well, it's just it's really it's dude. I spent six years in texas [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6779.0s)]
*  I don't know how to pronounce america. Damn [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6783.400000000001s)]
*  My wife in texas. Oh, okay. Austin, texas. Oh ut austin, huh? [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6785.88s)]
*  Austin are you a texas fan? Uh, so the funny thing be honest [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6789.400000000001s)]
*  I don't know if I ever told anybody this [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6793.96s)]
*  So i'm a new yorker in texas, which was a little bit mind-blowing [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6795.96s)]

*  That didn't come out of nowhere. Yeah, I didn't know I never thought you go to the state capital and you see the flags [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6879.8s)]
*  Yeah, i've actually been to state capital. Yeah, but um, so i'm there and I know so here's what happened [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6884.92s)]
*  When I left texas was six years later. I I get back to new york say, you know [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6892.280000000001s)]

*  five pairs of boots [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6913.400000000001s)]
*  And one of them is like ostrich, you know, I guess a stretch digging out digging out the animal [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6915.24s)]

*  And so it people it turns heads but [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6932.360000000001s)]
*  I'm comfortable in that because I I felt it it took it was a time delay [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6935.160000000001s)]
*  Yeah, right. It was I feel it now and now I can appreciate a texas movie or texas culture texas music [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6939.160000000001s)]
*  Which is not it's not country western really. Oh, it's not it's not it's not nashville. I should say no [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6945.72s)]

*  And I didn't know a sad song till I heard a sad texas song [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6958.200000000001s)]
*  I mean, yeah, I'm a big fan of the blues, you know blues all up the coast, you know [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6961.56s)]
*  Mississippi on up to chicago blues but up the river I guess I should say but um [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6966.84s)]
*  texas, you know up some [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6972.68s)]
*  singing in the [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6974.68s)]
*  You know my dog. Oh, there's some sadness over there sadness. Okay, harkin mccallum. You gotta listen to him [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6976.12s)]
*  He's kind of a sad young fellow. I'm a blues guy [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6981.08s)]
*  I'll do it. He's yeah, you know what his is a little bit of blues in a way [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6984.68s)]
*  Um, so, you know, I often theorize we talk about a lot of this show like beige [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6989.240000000001s)]
*  The future is going to be beige like eventually everything's kind of merging. We mean skin color [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6993.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that eventually everything is just kind of merging [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=6997.96s)]
*  um, and I wonder if it'll be like that with sexuality as well that everything will just [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7002.04s)]
*  Will everyone be like kind of this beige? [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7007.8s)]
*  trans kind of like [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7011.46s)]
*  You know, uh gang bang, you know, or like everybody just like [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7014.02s)]
*  You know, will everybody just be like a beige trans graffiti artist [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7019.54s)]
*  That's what I feel like. I feel like we're all just kind of a kind of I think there are enough people in the world that value [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7022.82s)]
*  Individual individuality that we will never be so homogenized really. Yeah, that's what I think [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7028.72s)]
*  Uh, so let's take this to a [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7034.82s)]
*  A scientific limit. Okay, we can now control the genome [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7037.46s)]
*  What is it? [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7040.9800000000005s)]
*  You know, so I got your genes and I can see you in in the uterus [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7041.78s)]
*  And I can nip and tuck and snip and thing and you'll come out [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7046.1s)]
*  Uh six feet tall, uh with this color skin this gender with this thing and this that and I can make you and that's not outlawed [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7049.62s)]
*  We don't the the ethics of this we don't know how to do that yet, but I don't see why we'll net that [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7058.1s)]
*  Wouldn't one day happen [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7063.78s)]
*  Our ethics are not really quite keeping up with it not from what i've read yet [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7065.38s)]
*  But there are people thinking about it. Okay. The first thing we're going to do is cure diseases for sure [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7069.38s)]
*  All right, you know genetic right you'll go in and stop people from having different kind of down syndrome [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7074.580000000001s)]
*  Exactly. Exactly. So obvious ones and we all have to agree which what to cure because even that has ethical issues [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7079.3s)]
*  That's true. For example, it was not until 1987. I report on that here in the gender and [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7085.620000000001s)]
*  Express gender and identity chapter. It was not until 1987 with the american psychological society psychiatric association [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7091.700000000001s)]
*  Whatever their acronym is. Um [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7098.759999999999s)]
*  The the american association of psychiatrists. It wasn't until 1987 where they removed [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7101.32s)]
*  homosexuality from the [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7107.139999999999s)]
*  Encyclopedia of mental disorders. Oh it used to be in there. Yes [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7109.219999999999s)]
*  So you ask the question it was before 1987 or even earlier and you had the medical capacity to [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7113.639999999999s)]
*  Quote fix someone whose genetic profile if that's where it's found it makes them gay. Would you do that? [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7120.44s)]
*  Back then they probably would because that's a disorder [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7127.240000000001s)]
*  They thought it was a mental disorder and then you find out that at least 15 of the one out of six is this [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7129.88s)]
*  At what point is it a disorder and what point is it just the natural variation of who we are as a species? [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7135.240000000001s)]
*  Damn, that's crazy. So the guy who's writing the disorders obviously was a straight guy [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7140.4400000000005s)]
*  Perceptive write-on and and there's the guy what's his neuroscientist? I always forget his name [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7146.900000000001s)]
*  But I guess if you're super straight say you're super straight you wander and out of a cave or whatever, right? [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7153.48s)]
*  You a straight guy [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7157.88s)]
*  You see I know that i'm straight. Can I tell you how I know i'm straight? How I know i'm straight because [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7159.5599999999995s)]
*  I wrestled for eight years [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7165.4s)]
*  The muscled sinewy sweaty bodies of other men. Yeah, and at no time [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7168.28s)]
*  Did I even have a tingle in my body? [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7174.36s)]
*  It's like i'm gonna pin your ass to the mat and get up and walk away [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7177.08s)]
*  Okay, that's what i'm good. I was captain of my high school wrestling team [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7181.08s)]
*  I'm just thinking my hands are all over men's bodies if I had any urge I would have felt it then [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7183.64s)]
*  So if they do one two, three four you still look at the tapping out the longer you stay there [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7188.76s)]
*  Oh, it's accounting the thing but I think yeah, you just stay there and don't tap because it feels good. I think that's crazy, baby [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7194.76s)]
*  Yeah, so so so i'm [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7202.04s)]
*  But you ever wonder heterosexual do you ever wonder if you could ever book? [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7204.44s)]
*  Because some people think you could evolve into it like I you know, I wouldn't [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7207.4s)]
*  Like I I would wonder if one day I could be when i'm 70 years old be a homosexual [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7211.24s)]
*  You know, I don't I don't know all the drivers and causes and what's genetic and what's cultural. I I don't know [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7215.8s)]
*  I don't even care. It's just whatever people want to be in a free country. Let them be that. Yeah, right [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7221.4s)]
*  So to even argue it it's like [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7226.36s)]
*  That's like arguing should someone wear their hair one way or the other wear the part [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7229.32s)]
*  It's it's how you express but I wouldn't say i'm a straight guy. That's your mullet and you're rocking that [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7233.88s)]
*  You've been rocking the mullet from day one. That's your thing if you came out with an afro [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7238.52s)]
*  You're somebody else at that point. Yeah, but this country allows that I don't if your fans would allow it [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7243.4800000000005s)]
*  But the country would allow it [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7248.04s)]
*  What about this so I think yeah, I can see if you're a straight guy you're writing the book right on what [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7252.04s)]
*  Straight psychiatrist right right in the book. You see a guy, you know [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7257.24s)]
*  You're hanging out with your buddies one of them reaches for another guy's weiner or whatever [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7260.5199999999995s)]
*  I could see you being like, uh, this is uh, this is [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7264.919999999999s)]
*  But do you think he thought it was wrong or he just thought just as simply I don't know that they value judge [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7268.679999999999s)]
*  They're just saying it's a disorder right in need of repair [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7274.36s)]
*  So but it was a disorder based on that things are just supposed to be this way because they had whatever biases they had whatever [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7278.839999999999s)]
*  inability to embrace the spectrum of humanity [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7286.0199999999995s)]
*  Presented to him right does nature [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7290.5199999999995s)]

*  So here's my point [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7339.400000000001s)]
*  that [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7341.160000000001s)]
*  I don't know that [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7342.280000000001s)]
*  We should care what the rest of the animal kingdom is doing [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7344.280000000001s)]
*  Do you know there's a there's a mole rat this called this this comes in a mole rat where oh, yeah [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7347.5599999999995s)]
*  One variant on it. They mate for life and the other one there is promiscuous as go all get out [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7351.96s)]
*  And they're both mole rats. I got both variants [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7358.04s)]
*  So they're both and they're both mole rats [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7361.5599999999995s)]
*  So and then people say oh eagles mate forever and they want that to be [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7363.88s)]
*  We want to emulate that and then you find out that bonobo chimps. They're fucking all the time [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7368.04s)]
*  To resolve differences to fight each other just look at this video. Yeah, it's behind the wall [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7374.12s)]
*  You gotta go behind the wall on the video [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7380.12s)]
*  And so and bonos are very close to us genetically. My point is we're human [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7382.44s)]
*  I don't care what the animals are doing. You can find an animal that'll support or or deny [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7387.24s)]
*  Whatever claim you're trying to make about us. So forget it. We're our own species. Yeah [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7393.0s)]
*  and that's true we have the capacity to grant freedoms in some governments to your [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7397.24s)]
*  To support your happiness. We value that. Yeah, that's cool. It's crazy to think that some countries don't right? [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7402.44s)]
*  That's why i'm glad i'm in america. Yeah [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7409.0s)]
*  Am I good at that right? I get like a b plus [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7413.24s)]
*  What about this so um [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7418.28s)]
*  So do you think we'll ever really be able to travel like into another galaxy like interstellarly? [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7421.48s)]
*  Do you think you need you need a wormhole? We're not doing that without wormholes [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7427.16s)]
*  We don't have like diesel or whatever. We don't have anything that'll push us there is no rocket [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7430.44s)]
*  No, there's a rocket that would get there eventually like in a few million years, but you don't live that long [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7434.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah, we we have rockets powerful enough to get you around the solar system in your lifetime [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7440.36s)]
*  But to the nearest stars at those speeds, it would take 50 000 years [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7445.4s)]
*  That's why they're talking about generational ships where you go and you have babies. No, they grow up. They have babies [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7449.96s)]
*  So people might do that. It's called a generational ship. Wow. It's a little weird because my ex on that bit [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7456.12s)]
*  Uh, it's a little weird because you're we're we're obligating the unborn [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7461.32s)]
*  To continue a mission that you're starting that they didn't have freedom [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7466.84s)]
*  to reject [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7470.76s)]
*  That's an ethical thing right there [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7473.0s)]
*  I know are you for it? [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7475.4s)]
*  Just i'll just wait around for the wormhole [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7477.88s)]
*  Just say yeah, dude, don't cut corners [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7480.76s)]
*  Let's send a boat. Oh, okay. Come on [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7483.32s)]
*  um [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7486.28s)]
*  So so yeah, so then we don't have anything right now that'll ever get us there [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7487.32s)]
*  So we're almost kind of stranded here stranded in the solar system. It's not so bad a lot of good stuff going on [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7490.36s)]
*  No, it's cool. Yeah. Yeah, why is it when I um [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7495.32s)]
*  When I look up at the like the sky by the way, just to be clear we got to the moon [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7499.0s)]
*  Hung out on the moon and came back in less time than it took columbus to cross the atlantic. Wow [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7504.44s)]
*  Wow [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7509.64s)]
*  So we're doing all right, you know, i'm okay. I'm okay we get to mars i'm sending people but we can send hardware [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7510.84s)]
*  To mars in nine months a little less. That's good [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7517.400000000001s)]
*  The wormhole what would it look how big would it be would you have to [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7521.320000000001s)]
*  Would you be able to walk into it or you have to kind of step into it? I I we okay [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7525.160000000001s)]
*  No, it's like you step across it like it's a threshold. Yeah, you've seen uh marvel and and dr strange [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7529.08s)]
*  or [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7535.88s)]
*  Rick and morty these are these are literal they call them portals to other dimensions or whatever [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7536.84s)]
*  But a wormhole would just be that you would just go through on one side come out the other [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7541.64s)]
*  And you would not see the fabric of the wormhole [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7546.2s)]
*  It would just be a hole in space [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7549.4800000000005s)]
*  And it's a hole every direction you look at when we think of a hole in a floor and you fall through [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7551.72s)]
*  This is a hole in full three-dimensional space. No matter which direction you go in [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7555.8s)]
*  You're entering the hole [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7559.96s)]
*  And you'll come out in another place [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7561.4800000000005s)]
*  And [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7563.719999999999s)]
*  Uh in some places if you take space time and curve it in one of the illustrations we have up on the wall now [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7564.919999999999s)]
*  It's curved [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7571.5599999999995s)]
*  So if you were to travel that whole distance around the curve that could take you a long time [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7572.839999999999s)]
*  You bend this imagine it's a piece of paper you bend it cut a hole through the two edges [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7576.759999999999s)]
*  You didn't have to take that long route and you bypass it and you get to the other side of the galaxy [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7583.0s)]
*  Before the end of the tv commercial and that's how the warp drive people do it [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7587.48s)]
*  Is that mathematically possible? Yes [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7591.72s)]
*  Really? Yeah, we don't but you promise. Oh, yes [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7594.5199999999995s)]
*  On paper we can do that, but you need some matter that can that's the opposite of gravity. So it's negative energy [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7597.96s)]
*  Stuff are we building that can pry open. I'm not authorized to say if we're building [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7605.0s)]
*  Are you really not [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7611.8s)]
*  Plus that's what I would say if I wasn't authorized [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7616.2s)]
*  I'm just kidding exactly what I would say [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7618.2s)]
*  Uh, that's like asking someone if they're a spy. Yeah, no, i'm not a spy. That's what a spy would say [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7620.92s)]
*  You know, there's no way out of that one, you know [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7625.96s)]
*  No, no, so so what we could you take stuff with you or would you have to not have any like carry-ons or whatever? [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7629.24s)]
*  Like how would you do you remember terminator when he came through time? He had to come through naked [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7634.599999999999s)]
*  Okay, because uh closing couldn't go through the the the portal [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7639.08s)]
*  Uh, or only living tissue could go through the portal, but here's a problem that I think they forgot or they [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7644.12s)]
*  Hair is not alive [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7650.6s)]
*  So going through balls. He should have gone through complete [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7652.68s)]
*  bald ass bare ass bald plus [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7655.7s)]
*  He has living tissue [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7659.320000000001s)]
*  But it's on top of his [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7661.16s)]
*  metallic skeleton [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7663.72s)]
*  Oh, yeah, so so the skeleton shouldn't have made it through [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7666.280000000001s)]
*  He would have just been a pile of flesh [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7670.12s)]
*  So they see the ring on the go along the ground [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7673.400000000001s)]
*  They weren't entirely consistent with their own rules. Would you be brave enough to go if they offered it to go? [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7676.280000000001s)]
*  No, i'd send a gerbil first [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7681.64s)]
*  Through first i'm not going through first. Hey bro people ask me do you want to ride on elon's rocket? [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7684.040000000001s)]
*  They say only after he sends his mother brings her back safely. Then i'll go until then i'm sitting right here [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7689.240000000001s)]
*  Wow [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7695.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you wouldn't go, huh? [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7696.68s)]
*  Until I until I know it's safe. All right, two gerbils go and they come back and they're not weird or anything or [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7699.08s)]
*  When i'm doing the uh hamster wheel backwards doing the hamster dance, right right smooth criminal [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7709.0s)]
*  On the wheel. Yeah. Yeah. So [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7715.400000000001s)]
*  um [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7718.52s)]
*  Did he do that in smooth criminal? Maybe he might have I think it was [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7720.280000000001s)]
*  I'm gonna [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7723.16s)]
*  Yeah, but he did a lean on it. Yeah. Yeah, what was the first concert you ever went to? [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7725.32s)]
*  Oh, thanks for asking. I don't go to many concerts [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7729.4s)]
*  for [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7732.68s)]
*  For not noble reasons. One of them is [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7734.36s)]
*  I prefer the quality of a studio album to people screaming in the background [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7736.92s)]
*  Oh, yeah, the occasional song is good like like free bird live [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7742.04s)]
*  That's the only way i'm consuming that song because it's longer than the album. It's like three minutes longer or something [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7745.88s)]
*  And lennard skinnered is jamming and every of the instruments [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7752.44s)]
*  So occasionally you get the extra stuff going on in the life, but mostly I like the acoustic quality of studio albums [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7755.8s)]
*  So therefore i'm not going to see you in concert. I'm going to buy your album. Just listen to you at home. Okay, that's one two [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7762.68s)]
*  Concerts are expensive dude. I didn't have that money growing up. It's expensive. So I just didn't go and [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7769.0s)]
*  Plus I didn't have a car because I grew up in the city [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7774.5199999999995s)]
*  So concerts were not just when you're in the city is less of a thing [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7776.84s)]
*  Most of the people went to concerts in madison square garden were out of towners coming in from jersey and long island and things [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7780.76s)]
*  So but I think my very first concert was earth wind and fire. Oh, yeah, I saw them in austin texas and then I saw [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7786.52s)]
*  Uh the commodores. Oh, yeah [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7793.56s)]
*  Then my sister worked for pepsico which had retained michael jackson for things and I saw michael jackson [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7796.52s)]
*  It pretty good seats too in madison square garden. Oh, these are some good stuff [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7801.64s)]
*  I'm not i'm not yeah, that's good. Uh, how was that? That was good. He did stuff white all the way back from abc [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7805.64s)]
*  It was a full retrospective [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7811.88s)]
*  Yeah, it was a full retrospective and [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7817.400000000001s)]
*  So I saw him. Uh [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7819.88s)]
*  I saw simon garfunkel [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7822.200000000001s)]
*  But my favorite these like my they're my my people let us feel is that them? No, that's the beetles, huh? [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7824.04s)]
*  Wait, so we're saying that again. I've got some real estate here in my oh, yeah, that's him. Yeah. Yeah [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7829.88s)]
*  Yeah, that's him at one of the songs. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7834.6s)]
*  Um, and so just a balladeer. Is that a word a balladeer of the era? [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7837.8s)]

*  We're both doing shows somewhere in san diego cool [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7887.96s)]
*  And [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7891.32s)]
*  I'm name dropping there, but he's my friend and we had and anyway roger daltry came and he sat at the table next to us [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7892.28s)]
*  Oh, and he and david knew each other. So I got to just got to watch him talk to each other for a second [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7898.12s)]
*  Very cool. So that to me was pretty cool. Cool. Yeah [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7902.36s)]
*  But you know, I do cities too. Do you know that you go perform? Yeah. Oh and speak. Yeah [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7906.28s)]
*  And just answer questions and and and they're in theaters, dude [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7911.0s)]
*  Yeah, I believe that right right and and the numbers that they get for stand-up comedians [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7914.599999999999s)]
*  They because we're not broadway, right? We're not you know [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7919.8s)]
*  You're you're a one person show on the stage with very little overhead to produce your show, right? [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7923.48s)]
*  And so that's the same with me. Well, there's a screen and I show the universe [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7929.24s)]
*  But I always interesting to see what comedians came before me or after me because i'm a big fan of your trade [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7933.48s)]
*  Uh, so thanks. Yeah, I think a lot of guys obviously [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7939.24s)]
*  Well, it's interesting thing about joe rogan is he introduces people to a lot of other people that they may not have been introduced [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7941.8s)]
*  From his audience. Yeah audience space. Yeah, it's pretty fascinating. Yeah. Yeah, and he's done it all [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7947.24s)]
*  He's the stand-up and tv host and everything. Yeah. Yeah, and he just is so cute [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7951.24s)]
*  He is one of the most curious people ever met in my life. He's a consummate researcher [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7956.28s)]
*  That's an example of it [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7961.16s)]
*  And the difference is he's curious in the moment and he's got an expert and he fills it up [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7962.5199999999995s)]
*  And then the expert goes away and then he fills in the blanks with his own thoughts [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7968.12s)]
*  Yeah, so so if you want to do that, right? [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7972.44s)]
*  You have the curiosity your guest stimulates that curiosity curiosity and then you go [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7976.04s)]
*  Take out books and finish the gaps. Yeah, and you know look at the documentaries the and then your your curiosity isn't just [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7981.08s)]
*  Satisfied in the moment. It's something that goes beyond the moment so that you get the broader deeper understanding [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7990.919999999999s)]
*  What's going on that would have helped him when he got that dust up with the vaccines. Yeah [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=7996.5199999999995s)]
*  Oh, yeah, they got on to him, huh? Yeah. Yeah totally got on him and people pulling out of stitcher and things [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8000.6s)]
*  You know was it stitcher or sound out? I forget what what whatever is his spotify spotify? [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8005.56s)]
*  So spotify, um, yeah, and people were pulling out of spotify, you know out of solidarity [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8010.76s)]
*  So it's so he got in his dust up. That's because he's curious in the moment [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8015.96s)]
*  But then in an add sort of way, right? [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8020.92s)]
*  Because the next the next shiny object he wants to know about that, right? [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8023.240000000001s)]
*  And then he get he knows just enough about that and you get into uh into that zone, yeah where [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8027.48s)]
*  You know just enough [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8035.08s)]
*  To think you're right [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8038.28s)]
*  But not enough to know you're wrong [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8040.36s)]
*  That's a zone that many people get into [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8044.12s)]
*  yeah, I think a lot I from what I remember and I don't know all of it, I think a lot of his stuff was that the [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8047.48s)]
*  the bio the [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8053.8s)]
*  The bio companies were really pushing the vaccines on people a ton [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8055.4s)]
*  You know, there'll be yeah, but is that a reason to not? [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8061.0s)]
*  Protect yourself against covid what you have to do is yeah, some of that can happen [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8064.679999999999s)]
*  All right. I don't know how much it happened during covid but we're honest with ourselves about [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8068.5199999999995s)]
*  Profit motives, right? Yeah. So now you watch now you look at [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8073.48s)]
*  Who's dying in the hospitals? [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8077.799999999999s)]
*  Okay [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8079.879999999999s)]
*  it's [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8081.08s)]
*  people [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8082.5199999999995s)]
*  Who are unvaccinated? [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8084.28s)]
*  with [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8086.5199999999995s)]
*  comorbidities primarily and then other people who are sort of [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8087.62s)]
*  Unvaccinated and older who are just sort of at risk but not being old is not itself a more comorbidity like being obese [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8091.38s)]
*  Right, but it's but right, but it's uh, these are factors. It's a factor. There are people who were not getting vaccinated [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8097.16s)]
*  And so do you want to stay out of the hospital? [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8103.88s)]
*  Do you want to not die and you look at the death toll the excess death because of covid? [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8105.96s)]
*  Um, it is you can see the bump in the in the in the um, [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8112.6s)]
*  Mortality statistics over those two years. There's there's whatever it is [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8118.9800000000005s)]
*  That's level because we're the same amount of approximately same amount of people number of people die every year in the united states [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8122.6s)]
*  And then in 2020 it went up [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8128.200000000001s)]
*  And then when the vaccine came in you saw it coming down a little and then the people were so [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8130.84s)]
*  Yes, it's a free country, but you can catch it [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8135.64s)]
*  And then spread it to somebody else who needs the protection [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8139.08s)]
*  Or can't get vaccinated because they have an immune problem. Do you so at that level you're being selfish? That's all [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8143.5599999999995s)]
*  Do you think in hindsight that I always felt like herd immunity would have been the best thing for that? [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8148.44s)]
*  I don't i'm not a scientist. Yeah, sure [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8154.839999999999s)]
*  But here at immunity it depends on the lethality of the drug and how quickly it spreads [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8156.5199999999995s)]
*  That'll determine the exact herd immunity, but you got to typically be up around 90 percent vaccination [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8160.759999999999s)]
*  So that 10 would not have to be vaccinated and they won't catch it but the herd immunity in a rational [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8165.88s)]
*  Society that cares about its citizens the nine percent ten percent that don't get [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8173.16s)]
*  Immunized it's because they can't be immunized [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8179.08s)]
*  You want the herd immunity to protect the weak? [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8182.84s)]
*  The people who are immune compromised the people who have some genetic disorder where they rely on you to be vaccinated [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8186.52s)]
*  So I don't catch so they don't catch the disease [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8193.8s)]
*  That's how we should be using herd immunity not because you were because you were [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8197.0s)]
*  um [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8202.279999999999s)]
*  By the way, the liberals and conservatives met each other on the other side of the fence for this. I know [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8203.48s)]
*  The og the og anti-vaxxers were liberals [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8207.72s)]
*  Okay, who don't trust the farmer and don't trust the big business and all the rest of this and then the the the freedom angle [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8211.88s)]
*  Came in from the right. Uh, you can't make them [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8219.16s)]
*  I don't want to yeah, okay, don't put this in my body. Right, right. It's dangerous vaccines are dangerous that vaccines cause or [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8222.84s)]
*  Yeah, so they cherry picked things and they go to websites and they spend you know an hour or more but researching it [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8229.880000000001s)]
*  And then they will claim to know more than the medical professionals [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8236.52s)]
*  so sure if you if you don't want to be get vaccinated they go live alone until the [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8240.92s)]
*  Till the virus goes away [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8246.2s)]
*  But stay out of the zones of people who could catch it from you if you caught it [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8248.52s)]
*  Do you feel like if we would have not done a vaccine and just let the virus go through us? [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8253.0s)]
*  It would have just went through us. It would have killed five times as many people really easily [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8256.84s)]
*  easily [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8262.2s)]
*  Wow, you don't remember hospitals were overrun people were in the corridors [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8263.640000000001s)]
*  They have mass burials. Oh my gosh [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8268.04s)]
*  How quickly people forget well, I remember they put people on ventilators [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8270.84s)]
*  But didn't they then they realized that they shouldn't have put people in well [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8274.04s)]
*  Yeah, so on the moving frontier of a new thing. Yeah, it's easy to say oh you shouldn't have done that right right now at the time [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8276.76s)]
*  It's like you're having trouble breathing. There's a ventilator and then people do experiments [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8283.320000000002s)]
*  This is the value of experiments say well if you tip this way or you you breathe through a hole in the table or whatever [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8288.04s)]
*  And there's a better chance and that gets published [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8294.28s)]
*  Gets disseminated and then you have a new best practice in that moment and the public [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8297.240000000002s)]
*  The public saw this happening in real. Normally it happens [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8302.92s)]
*  You don't even see it right because it's a controlled study on some corner of the world or in some country [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8306.28s)]
*  You don't even see it until it's already tested out [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8312.76s)]
*  But you don't want to hold the vaccine longer than necessary if you could be saving lives with it [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8315.720000000001s)]
*  Hence the emergency provisions that were put into place [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8320.12s)]
*  So the problem was I think people don't know what science is or how and why it works [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8323.880000000001s)]
*  And if you taught that in school you'd say okay, this is uh the mask [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8329.32s)]
*  But we also need to clean the things because we know viruses transmit on the surfaces [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8333.56s)]
*  Turns out this virus was less a surface virus and more of an airborne virus [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8338.44s)]
*  Oh, yeah [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8342.76s)]
*  I remember I had a buddy who was wearing a hazmat suit to get his instacart deliveries and he was pressure washing boxes of [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8343.08s)]
*  Triscuits in his front yard because at the time that we know that to be successful against [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8349.220000000001s)]
*  Variants of a virus but it not that one we didn't know yet [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8355.32s)]
*  Yeah, but are you gonna say well, we don't know yet. So therefore i'm not going to do anything [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8359.4s)]
*  No, you do what has worked in other you do that until we refine it people were not allowing science to run its course [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8364.04s)]
*  do you think that during the pandemic that the uh, that the [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8371.8s)]
*  The [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8379.16s)]
*  uh vaccine [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8380.92s)]
*  And the bio company the pharmaceutical companies that they hijacked science or hijacked the media [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8383.08s)]
*  Their studies get reviewed by uh panels of scientists. This is what the fda does [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8390.84s)]
*  That's the whole point one of the main points of the fda is to do this [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8396.44s)]
*  So they study the efficacy of the of the virus of the uh vaccine and they they study how effective is it against uh children? [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8400.68s)]
*  Also things like it can be effective, but at what dose? [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8409.24s)]
*  The most there's more than one moving part here in the studies. They did the studies and they found it was like 95 [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8412.119999999999s)]
*  Effective against that variant. So they said let's roll it out [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8418.68s)]
*  No need to do further experiments on this on the effectiveness of the vaccine. Now here's here's an interesting challenge [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8422.199999999999s)]
*  If your vaccine is so perfect [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8430.6s)]
*  That it knocks out this variant [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8434.119999999999s)]
*  Perfectly [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8438.66s)]
*  It might not be effective against another variant of that same virus [[02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8440.82s)]
*  Right [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8444.98s)]
*  Oh, it could be too perfect. Okay, it could be too perfect [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8446.02s)]
*  correct [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8448.98s)]
*  and so [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8450.34s)]
*  So that we need certain research this may be going i'm not i'm not on that frontier of a of a viral serum [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8451.86s)]
*  that's more sort of a cocktail [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8459.3s)]
*  of [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8461.86s)]
*  anti-viral [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8463.14s)]
*  elements so that [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8464.82s)]
*  Whenever the thing tries to morph or or or or mutate [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8466.66s)]
*  We got you you can't mutate out of this. Oh, I see out of this group of [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8470.74s)]
*  um, and so what they do now with the flu vaccine is they just they have the specific [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8475.46s)]
*  um, uh, uh [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8481.619999999999s)]
*  They have the specific recipes and they they do cocktail together [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8484.34s)]
*  For the the seasonal flu virus because they see different flus showing up and they put them together [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8488.5s)]
*  But I I foresee a day when you take one antiviral serum it takes cat takes out all viruses [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8493.539999999999s)]
*  That'd be a fun day [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8499.06s)]
*  Do you think that yeah? [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8500.58s)]
*  Because a lot of we had bobby kennedy on and he was talking about like he was really against dr [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8501.7s)]
*  Fauci and a lot of like yeah, he's yeah [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8506.1s)]
*  He has a book the truth about dr. Fauci, right? So he's he's he's an environmentalist [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8507.86s)]
*  So he was always grew up like about the environment, right? [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8513.14s)]
*  Then he's like about the environment inside of your body [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8516.18s)]
*  He you know, I he believes that a lot of vaccines and stuff like [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8518.5s)]
*  Can cause more damage over time? [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8523.86s)]
*  Yeah, except when you look at the people who don't die for having had the vaccine [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8526.1s)]
*  So there's a lot of I mean, there's a lot of cherry picking of [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8530.18s)]
*  Data, I mean, I think he came to this vaccine argument [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8534.34s)]
*  this vaccine world because he's [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8538.58s)]
*  He sees the abuses of [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8540.9s)]
*  corporate [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8543.44s)]
*  Greed. Yeah. All right [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8544.5s)]
*  And in the environment a corporation will do something regardless of its effect on the environment or its effect on people [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8546.02s)]
*  So he I think that [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8551.86s)]
*  Not that he's an expert on vaccines and virology or anything [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8554.26s)]
*  But that he sees big corporations he sees governments like he's a lawyer [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8557.380000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and he sees people and he wants to protect people [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8560.980000000001s)]
*  So that's a noble cause a legacy of his entire family, of course that in multi generations [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8563.460000000001s)]
*  so but what happens is people can get [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8569.460000000001s)]
*  They get onto something that they think is true [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8572.58s)]
*  and [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8575.78s)]
*  But the there's a larger statistical truth [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8577.060000000001s)]
*  That negates what you think if you see three cases because the testimony is strong [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8580.5s)]
*  Because or or someone coincidentally gets some other thing after they get a an injection and they and they they stand up and give a talk [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8586.34s)]
*  He's oh my gosh [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8594.66s)]
*  This is the this is what i'm telling you you're looking into the person's eyes and you feel their emotions and you see the fire [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8596.66s)]
*  And that becomes more real to you [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8602.02s)]
*  Than a pie chart. Yeah [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8604.58s)]
*  So it's interesting you can get caught up in that and [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8607.38s)]
*  But do you think that these days like that because you're from the science community that like big pharma [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8610.74s)]
*  Like they have enough money and power that they could alter [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8616.1s)]
*  Because that's what I feel like a lot of people that they could alter [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8620.26s)]
*  the data or cherry pick it enough and present it to [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8623.62s)]
*  Humans in a way that would just support what they want. Well, so [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8628.02s)]
*  So what that's what I think in the end a lot of people probably that's the thing that I think people think [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8633.619999999999s)]
*  that big pharma [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8639.619999999999s)]
*  Hijacked a lot of the information or adjusted it to make people believe [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8641.68s)]
*  And think okay except we have people dying in the hospital who are not vaccinated and people alive who were right? [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8647.14s)]
*  so [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8654.74s)]
*  You can keep talking. Okay, you can keep saying whatever you want [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8656.18s)]
*  But we have evidence [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8661.46s)]
*  That conflicts with your conspiratorial views, right? [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8664.02s)]
*  And evidence matters in the end [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8668.74s)]
*  And so, you know could they have faked could they have put their entire 100 year reputat Pfizer or whatever? [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8671.619999999999s)]
*  How old they are, but I think it's around their 100 year reputation [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8677.78s)]
*  on the line [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8681.78s)]
*  By faking data [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8684.42s)]
*  So that we would all think their vaccine will keep us out of the hospital [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8687.38s)]
*  Just to sell it [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8693.54s)]
*  We would know within weeks if not days [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8695.7s)]
*  If that was all a lie. Yeah [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8699.78s)]
*  We would know [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8702.26s)]
*  Because there would be as many people in the hospital who've been dying who've been vaccinated who were not [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8704.18s)]
*  And those are two samples you want to compare with each other [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8710.5s)]
*  Yeah, and when you compare that no that it's effective it's effective now what what what took people by [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8713.619999999999s)]
*  What surprised people is? [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8720.339999999998s)]
*  Yeah, you vaccine vaccinate me against the measles. I'm not getting the measles. You can breathe on me. I'm not getting the measles. All right [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8722.339999999998s)]
*  So why do people still get covid after they got vaccinated against covid? Yeah [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8729.699999999999s)]
*  They got a lighter case of covid then they would have otherwise gotten [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8735.859999999999s)]
*  Uh [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8739.06s)]
*  Okay, you surely know people who got covid who are vaccinated [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8740.26s)]
*  It was a you know, five day vacation at home [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8744.34s)]
*  Okay, use a box of tissues and you're back a few days later [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8747.14s)]
*  Were they on ventilators and were they even admitted to a hospital? No, no [[02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8750.34s)]
*  No, when people get it now, i'm like, I almost think they're bullshit [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8754.34s)]
*  People are like I got covered like fucking get in here. Yeah, do your work, dude [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8758.66s)]
*  I'll take it [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8763.859999999999s)]
*  um [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8765.539999999999s)]
*  Do you worry about the like so science is [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8766.42s)]
*  Information, right and objective information are things that can't change if it's been verified by multiple experiments, right? [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8770.8s)]
*  And there's a result that comes out of it. That's not tomorrow going to be different from today [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8778.18s)]
*  Do you worry about the way that we share? [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8782.18s)]
*  Information now because that's almost scarier. That's [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8785.6s)]
*  You know just like [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8789.78s)]
*  News channels and outlets and clips the way we see things it's adjusting people's [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8791.38s)]
*  The way we think all the time. It's it's taking over the value of the information. That's insightful and perceptive and correct [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8796.66s)]
*  That they're not only controlling the information you receive. They're shaping how you receive it [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8804.82s)]
*  Which has an effect on how you then behave? [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8811.46s)]
*  and act on that information [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8815.06s)]
*  so [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8817.779999999999s)]
*  As a scientist, we're trained not always successfully. We're trained to detach [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8819.06s)]
*  from the emotions of a testimony [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8824.82s)]
*  we're trained to [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8827.779999999999s)]
*  Be skeptical of a claim that's made that's opposite other claims that have been made before [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8829.779999999999s)]
*  If someone says we've seen the youtuber who's the dude hanging on his arm? [[02:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8836.019999999999s)]
*  Uh, and it's said, uh, uh, no, no, no, no the guy who wants you to do his diet, uh, his muscle growth [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8840.66s)]
*  He wants you to grow muscles. He's a muscle guy. Oh, so that's a saloon. No, no, no [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8847.3s)]
*  He's just some guy. He's just some guy. Okay, like a fitness expert [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8850.26s)]
*  Okay, but he's got something he's selling you and he's saying, you know the best way to get ripped muscles [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8853.14s)]
*  It's not by going to the gym every day. It's by doing my thing. Oh, okay. So it's we respond to that [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8858.019999999999s)]
*  Once again, it's the easy way out. We respond to a testimony that's saying everybody else is wrong, but this is right [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8864.5s)]
*  As a scientist, we are trained to be skeptical of that claim [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8872.42s)]
*  The person that says all these scientists and all that they're all wrong and they're all in conspiracy, but i'm correct. Listen to me [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8877.06s)]
*  We're trained to be and then not to just be skeptical and go on with life. I'm gonna find out [[02:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8882.9s)]
*  If what you're saying is true, why is conspiracy because conspiracies? [[02:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8888.42s)]
*  Uh, and the idea of conspiracy theories have grown more in the past 10 years. I think so. I think so [[02:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8892.34s)]
*  It seems like sadly but yes [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8897.46s)]
*  Do you wait? What do you attribute that to the urge to be comfortable in your own belief system? [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8899.22s)]
*  We started the conversation that way. Yeah, you were saying this is what I am and if someone's poking at the sides [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8904.9s)]
*  I don't want it. I don't want to know about it. So now you create a worldview [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8909.06s)]
*  You create an understanding of how things are [[02:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8914.02s)]
*  Either because someone convinced you or you convinced yourself. Okay [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8917.7s)]
*  Now there's a gap [[02:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8921.86s)]
*  Or there's some information that conflicts with it [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8924.58s)]
*  So you're going to say if you cherish this worldview that information that conflicts with it was falsified [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8927.78s)]
*  Or that was wrong [[02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8934.259999999998s)]
*  They don't know what they're doing [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8936.019999999999s)]
*  Or if there's a gap in the information, you'll say someone's hiding [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8937.859999999999s)]
*  The and that so you say by saying someone hiding it that bridges you from one bit of information to another and you can maintain your worldview [[02:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8942.74s)]
*  As a scientist it is our duty [[02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8951.699999999999s)]
*  To disturb our worldview every day the headline that says scientists have to go back to the drawing board because their cherished theories might be put in jeopardy [[02:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8954.98s)]
*  This is bullshit [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8963.22s)]
*  We're at the drawing board every single day of our lives. That's what we do is what we live for a new discovery [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8965.22s)]
*  Who is the one in our office with our feet up on the desk? [[02:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8972.34s)]
*  Masters of all the knowledge of the universe. That's not us [[02:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8976.18s)]
*  Who is uh who tests who is the final say so of something from science that it can go into society? [[02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8980.019999999999s)]
*  Well in my field, there's none of that because we the patient doesn't die [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8986.98s)]
*  Okay [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8990.98s)]
*  I can be spectacularly wrong about how a galaxy is rotating [[02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8991.94s)]
*  And there's no there's no product that's going to be made based on it [[02:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=8996.26s)]
*  Right. So so as you as what you do gets closer and closer to the condition to the human condition [[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9000.26s)]
*  Then you need sort of regulations and careful scrutiny. That's why the fda exists and there's no counterpart to the fda [[02:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9006.5s)]
*  for astrophysics [[02:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9013.94s)]
*  Can the fda be compromised or not? [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9016.74s)]
*  I in principle, I think anything can be compromised. But what you so what it comes down to is [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9019.3s)]
*  You would say [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9025.06s)]
*  The fda is saying this does any other? [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9026.5s)]
*  agency [[02:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9029.119999999999s)]
*  Say something completely different [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9030.58s)]
*  I'm not talking about a youtube page a little agency [[02:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9032.66s)]
*  If it's incomplete, then then let's take a closer look. It's a reason to look closer not a reason to reject or accept [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9035.699999999999s)]
*  That's all and [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9042.42s)]
*  Might they give oh, so here's one. I got one [[02:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9044.9s)]
*  Uh the food pyramid this this oh, yeah, I remember that this is completely bread interesting [[02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9047.939999999999s)]
*  I i'm even gonna say honest [[02:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9056.1s)]
*  Uh [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9060.58s)]
*  Should I say let me not use the word honest. It's an interesting [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9062.1s)]
*  Sequence of events. Okay. Here it is. Okay [[02:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9065.699999999999s)]
*  There's a study in europe [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9068.9s)]
*  Tens of thousands of people it's a diet study. Okay, and they find out [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9071.939999999999s)]
*  that [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9077.779999999999s)]
*  Uh, the mediterranean diet is healthier for you [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9078.98s)]
*  Low in saturated fats low butter not so much meat [[02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9082.82s)]
*  grains [[02:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9086.98s)]
*  Are in there so beans and and wheat and this sort of thing [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9088.5s)]
*  And so and saturated fats. Oh, that's bad for you. It'll reduce your so this study came out here [[02:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9092.98s)]
*  We are okay this study came out and it was [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9099.38s)]
*  It took the world by storm because it was so many people and european europe is is is westernized, right? [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9103.46s)]
*  And we all live a western life [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9110.02s)]
*  so [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9111.78s)]
*  This was oh my gosh [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9113.06s)]
*  We all got to do this [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9115.94s)]
*  So drop the saturated fats drop the cholesterol drop all this stuff that'll kill you fast [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9117.14s)]
*  And eat the breads and things and that okay [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9123.86s)]
*  that's what contributed to [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9127.22s)]
*  Uh to impart the the the just the diet a carb diet. Yeah, okay, and when we did that everybody started getting fat [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9130.179999999998s)]
*  Everybody started getting fat because you know happens something else happens [[02:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9139.46s)]
*  Right. There's that there's the other side of it. There's another carb in your diet puts your metabolism on a roller coaster [[02:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9142.82s)]
*  And you end up with food cravings [[02:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9149.06s)]
*  That you didn't previously have [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9152.099999999999s)]
*  Because you got your calories from sources other than carbohydrates [[02:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9154.42s)]
*  So there was a secondary effect that was not folded in but more important that european study of i forgot how many countries [[02:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9157.96s)]
*  Was missing france [[02:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9166.36s)]
*  How do you have a european study that doesn't have france in it? I don't know people don't like them, okay [[02:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9170.44s)]
*  I mean that one no other explanation [[02:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9176.199999999999s)]
*  We hate the french maybe they didn't call baby they didn't answer when you called [[02:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9179.88s)]
*  Okay, you have a study but that is yeah, you gotta have everybody well not just you have to have everybody which is true [[02:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9183.48s)]
*  You have a study telling people that cholesterol is bad for you [[02:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9190.199999999999s)]
*  And you're missing a country [[02:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9194.119999999999s)]
*  that is [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9196.92s)]
*  steeped in animal fat [[02:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9198.44s)]
*  The for grave the butter the croissant the duck fat all of this [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9201.16s)]
*  Ducks are fucking almost do you know that the life expectancy in france? [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9207.88s)]
*  Is like 36 months. No [[02:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9213.64s)]
*  It's like six months shorter than italy which has the mediterranean [[02:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9216.68s)]
*  France has also got a mediterranean thing, but their diet you don't think it was the mediterranean diet [[02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9222.44s)]
*  So they had no not significantly less life experience than other countries that didn't eat any of that [[02:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9227.08s)]
*  That was not in the study put it in so the study had a built-in bias [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9233.16s)]
*  That people were not thinking of at the time the study was [[02:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9238.84s)]
*  So this is the bias you have to watch out for yeah here we are doing experiment believing something that's not true [[02:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9241.88s)]
*  And that's why lately they say put in some cholesterol back in your diet [[02:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9248.199999999999s)]
*  it's and and and [[02:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9252.52s)]
*  Because we're learning that [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9254.28s)]
*  What we thought was true out of that from that one study. That's the point [[02:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9256.36s)]
*  One study doesn't make the truth. Yeah, the other study that tested and reverify it [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9261.0s)]
*  Yeah, because I saw I was watching uh [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9266.44s)]
*  Well, I was just watching that show dope sick and it was about like the [[02:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9268.2s)]
*  Opioid crisis or whatever. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it was crazy. Yeah. Yeah, it's crazy. Sometimes that [[02:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9271.78s)]
*  Why do we let bad things? [[02:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9277.640000000001s)]
*  Into our society that seems so bad, you know [[02:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9280.92s)]
*  um [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9284.68s)]
*  It would seem like sometimes we would be able to well we have addiction problems. I mean that's a problem. Yeah addiction [[02:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9286.04s)]
*  That's a good point. Yeah, right if we didn't have addiction problems and you need none of that, right? [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9291.480000000001s)]
*  Yeah, let me get high today and then i'm fine tomorrow, right i'm not [[02:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9295.4s)]
*  You know, so that's a susceptibility we have in our physiology [[02:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9298.76s)]
*  You can be a gambling addicted and there are many addictions. Oh, yeah, we got a lot of addicts. Listen to this. Okay [[02:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9303.64s)]
*  We do okay. No, I've been an addict. I mean I talk I don't mean to laugh right? Oh, no, it's fine girl [[02:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9310.68s)]
*  We laugh about it. Yeah. Yeah [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9315.24s)]
*  So the addictions are are that weakness and when you have other people that exploit that weakness [[02:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9316.68s)]
*  Yeah, like the casinos [[02:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9322.119999999999s)]
*  And the drug dealers anything. Yeah anything. Yeah [[02:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9324.119999999999s)]
*  Someone's there to make money offer your inability to stop what you're doing [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9328.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I worry about like even with the drug dealers at like big levels. It's like [[02:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9333.0s)]
*  Are we is our fda? [[02:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9337.32s)]
*  Compromisable sometimes I worry [[02:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9339.619999999999s)]
*  You know or if we've gotten to that point as a country where everything's like we're just it's more well [[02:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9341.64s)]
*  If you lose all confidence in [[02:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9346.759999999998s)]
*  The agencies and the entire system [[02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9349.24s)]
*  um [[02:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9352.76s)]
*  Then where are you going to put your confidence? Is it the youtube channel you were looking at? Is it the [[02:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9355.0s)]
*  Yeah, is it the guy on the youtube channel say the fda is wrong about everything rhyme right by what i'm selling you right where so [[02:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9360.76s)]
*  It's a good question. I think but that's what I think you see a [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9368.2s)]
*  I don't know if you see a lot of that happening [[02:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9371.64s)]
*  But I think there's people who don't know where to put their confidence anymore [[02:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9373.24s)]
*  I feel like we used to all know where to put our confidence. Does that make any sense? [[02:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9376.84s)]
*  Yes, but i'm saying there are people who are sowing doubt [[02:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9380.92s)]
*  In places where there's no need to do so [[02:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9384.84s)]
*  People who are indicting the entire scientific community. Oh, by the way while they're still using their smartphone, okay [[02:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9387.56s)]
*  I sent out a tweet should I have left it in my forbidden file? I don't know. It was a letter. It was like dear [[02:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9394.84s)]

*  Found each other [[02:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9414.9s)]
*  And communicate with one another [[02:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9417.62s)]
*  Using a device that [[02:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9422.98s)]
*  That [[02:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9429.460000000001s)]
*  Using a sophisticated device that uses [[02:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9430.42s)]
*  Frontier advanced discoveries in engineering science technology and math [[02:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQ0qxyf-Ds&t=9434.960000000001s)]
