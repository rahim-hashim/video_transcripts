*  I'll sit and tell you my stories. Shine on me. And I will find a song I've been singing just for you. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=59.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's good over there. It's just like something like sometime you have to. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=82.0s)]
*  I get a lot of compliments on these. They're not real snakeskin, but you shouldn't even wear fake stuff. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=87.0s)]
*  I'm vegan because if you make it look good, then people are like, I want that. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=97.0s)]
*  You know, if you make fake look good, then you're hurting the animals. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=101.0s)]
*  No, I don't. I think that's that seems crazy. But do you think vegan? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=104.0s)]
*  Can you eat snake or not? No, no, you can't eat. People always forget that vegan is like everything. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=109.0s)]
*  Like I eat honey. If something honey is in something, I'll go, OK, fine. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=115.0s)]
*  But a lot of vegans like won't eat honey because it like it exploits bees. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=118.0s)]
*  No way. I but bees want us to have it because also when you think about all this stuff that bees do to us and all the. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=122.0s)]
*  What have bees done to us? We're getting revenge. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=130.0s)]
*  All the child. Do you know how many of summers of mine were ruined because bees weren't? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=133.0s)]
*  They were they were ruined because of your perception of bees as being like people are so scared of bees. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=139.0s)]
*  Their sting doesn't hurt that bad. You might if you're allergic. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=145.0s)]
*  Yes, I understand. But like we oh we were so annoyed with bees. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=148.0s)]
*  We killed them all. And now our like our whole planet is collapsing because there's no bees. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=151.0s)]
*  Oh, dang. But what were your run ins with bees as a kid? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=157.0s)]
*  Let's get your top three bee incidents. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=159.0s)]
*  Well, the big one was always your child at summer camp. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=162.0s)]
*  They always had bees there for some reason, you know. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=165.0s)]
*  And so we go there to this place called Bogota, Folia Park. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=168.0s)]
*  And it was just like all the kids would come and it was like a bunch of this ratchet kids. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=172.0s)]
*  And like we'd all have our lunch box and like our our cool label like spill over on our sandwiches. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=177.0s)]
*  And it was so gross. It was like YMCA summer camp, you know. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=183.0s)]
*  Yeah. And some kids would leave during the day and just wander off into the woods and disappear. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=186.0s)]
*  And like it was just but I remember at certain areas they just had so many bees. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=190.0s)]
*  They're like like I want to say tens of thousands of bees. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=195.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. And you guys were events canceled because of bees. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=198.0s)]
*  Oh, I would say events. I would say I would say kickball games ended early. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=203.0s)]
*  I would say lunches ended early. One kid a bee went up his nose and and that was horrible. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=207.0s)]
*  And they had to get this before that. I think they had the EpiPens or whatever. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=215.0s)]
*  Oh, so this kid was allergic to. Yeah. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=219.0s)]
*  Or I don't know if he's allergic, but he was one of those kids who their skin was real clear looking. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=221.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Like one of those kind of premature baby kind of. Yeah. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=224.0s)]
*  That trans kid or lucent kid. I don't know what they call them. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=228.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think they're called lucents. Yeah. One of those lucents, dude. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=233.0s)]
*  So they got yeah. Yeah. But some kids were never the same. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=236.0s)]
*  I feel like after that after a strong bee came through. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=238.0s)]
*  Oh, people were people are so scared of bees. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=241.0s)]
*  And I thought it was just a way that girls. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=244.0s)]
*  I was never really scared of bees. I was just like, OK, if they sing you, it kind of hurts. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=246.0s)]
*  But I think being scared of bugs is kind of like a thing girls do to like get attention and like be let not just necessarily from boys, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=249.0s)]
*  but just they're not being seen enough in their families. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=256.0s)]
*  So they're just like, if I scream really loud about this thing that's around a lot, then I'll get attention. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=259.0s)]
*  And it's my thing. I'm like girls that are like, I hate moist. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=265.0s)]
*  Like that's a hack one. But people are looking for moist. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=267.0s)]
*  The word moist. Right. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=270.0s)]
*  You know, when girls are like, oh, my God, don't say it. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=271.0s)]
*  And you're just like, you need an identity beyond like these things that you think are unique. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=273.0s)]
*  But we all kind of are on board with. Yeah. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=278.0s)]
*  A lot of people say those types of things. I mean, but we're all searching for an identity. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=281.0s)]
*  I mean, your haircut is like a part of like that haircut. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=285.0s)]
*  I remember when you first brought out, I thought it was for a role or something. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=288.0s)]
*  And now it's you. And it's like, and it's such a look that you've inspired people to adopt it. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=292.0s)]
*  It's now like a hot guy haircut. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=297.0s)]
*  But when you first debuted it wasn't really deal. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=300.0s)]
*  I remember you walking backstage at some show. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=304.0s)]
*  I think we were at some one of Amy's tapings or something. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=307.0s)]
*  You came backstage and I sound handsome. I laughed at your haircut. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=310.0s)]
*  I thought it was a joke. I thought you were trying to joke us. Really? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=315.0s)]
*  Yeah, I did. I'm being honest with you. But I thought but I also was like, it looks good. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=318.0s)]
*  You know, like the type of way like a like on Halloween, people look still look good. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=322.0s)]
*  Yeah. Then you kept your Halloween costume on it. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=326.0s)]
*  And I was like, and then and now it's still here. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=328.0s)]
*  And that was probably six years ago. How long has it been? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=330.0s)]
*  Five years ago? Well, I had long hair too when I was a kid. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=333.0s)]
*  And I just liked I never felt I never knew I was supposed to have long hair as an adult until I had it. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=335.0s)]
*  You didn't know you weren't supposed to? I never knew that I was supposed to. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=342.0s)]
*  Oh, you mean like you found your truth like this who you are? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=345.0s)]
*  Yeah, I just never felt I just like feel more like a man. I feel more like a courageous man. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=348.0s)]
*  I feel like more like somebody that would run into a fire to help somebody. Yeah. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=354.0s)]
*  Or not run all the way and I would run close to the fire and you know, he was like, oh, he's going to stop. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=357.0s)]
*  I'd run up the stairs on the porch. OK, because fire is so hot. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=362.0s)]
*  People like in movies, they make it look like it's not that hot. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=367.0s)]
*  Dude, fire is so hot. It's so what's the worst you've been burned? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=370.0s)]
*  Like, have you gotten like what degree? Let me think. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=375.0s)]
*  Probably three bad burns. Oh, yeah, dude. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=380.0s)]
*  I went whale or not whale watching, but looking for something once and and I got sunburned so bad, dude. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=383.0s)]
*  You can't go from whale watching to looking for your keys like we were looking for the Lord, honey. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=391.0s)]
*  You're looking for the Lord. You got sunburned real bad. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=398.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think we're doing drugs or something and then ended up ended up out in the sun for way too long. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=400.0s)]
*  And my friend kept dozing off. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=405.0s)]
*  We ended up at this Elton John concert and he was on opioids and he literally kept dozing off, dude. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=407.0s)]
*  And one time we thought he was dead. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=412.0s)]
*  But we were so messed up we kept like nobody would check to see if he was dead. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=415.0s)]
*  It was kind of like not like freeze tag, but some like weird game. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=419.0s)]
*  You know, it was like a kid's game, you know. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=423.0s)]
*  And so you thought he was dead. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=425.0s)]
*  Some of you were scared by it, but mostly it was just like like that's hilarious. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=427.0s)]
*  Everybody was laughing. It was just one of those days. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=431.0s)]
*  We're like, oh, you know, did. Yeah. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=433.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. I am. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=436.0s)]
*  But I guess, yeah, I think things like that bees sunshine, things like that, I guess. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=438.0s)]
*  Yeah, like a lot of is dangerous. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=442.0s)]
*  I don't go in the sun. I've been I've known that aging as a woman is a bad thing. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=445.0s)]
*  So I haven't been going in the sun since I was in high school. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=449.0s)]
*  I used to always sunbathe and I used to cover my face and decolletage with a towel when I was like 15. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=451.0s)]
*  Like, oh, wow. Just to be like, I don't want to be wrinkly when I'm older. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=456.0s)]
*  I even knew at a young age when you're supposed to think you're young forever, like plan ahead. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=460.0s)]
*  And the truth is, it's like you can't really stop it. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=465.0s)]
*  It's just going to happen. It's hard. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=468.0s)]
*  I think, yeah, I think I'm starting to realize even just growing up that it's hard to get it's hard to get older. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=470.0s)]
*  It's a little tough, you know, it's like it's kind of like. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=475.0s)]
*  It's just so. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=480.0s)]
*  It makes me I often realize how much time I probably wasted, whereas like time used to be this thing of like, sure, have some of my time, you know. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=485.0s)]
*  Yeah, like I've got as much time, you know, who wants some of my time? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=495.0s)]
*  You know, you have so much time that you're running around this big bag of time. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=499.0s)]
*  And then now it's like, oh, you know, I don't have a second to spare, you know. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=503.0s)]
*  And it's like time. It's just you're right. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=508.0s)]
*  I mean, like you watch on any of those things about the tech companies that are trying to create things that take our time. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=510.0s)]
*  Like our time is the only thing we can't get back. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=516.0s)]
*  Yeah. So it's like they really just want our our attention and like what what you give attention to. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=519.0s)]
*  But I feel like getting older and realizing, oh, the things I've wasted my time on have not really that kind of being like, God, I wasted so much time. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=525.0s)]
*  Doesn't help me not waste time now because I'm not finding new ways to waste it. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=532.0s)]
*  But you know what I do now? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=535.0s)]
*  Like when I find like what's something you wasted your time on that you can think about in the past that you go. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=536.0s)]
*  Masturbation, probably. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=541.0s)]
*  Listen, I also I don't think that's a waste of time. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=542.0s)]
*  It's fucking awesome. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=545.0s)]
*  What? It's awesome. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=547.0s)]
*  But you get the hang of it. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=548.0s)]
*  And then it's kind of like it feels good. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=549.0s)]
*  You wanted to feel good. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=551.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=552.0s)]
*  Like I feel like anytime I still do it, you know, it's like when you do it again, you're like, where do you want to be right now? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=553.0s)]
*  Doing too much masturbating didn't get you to where you want to be like you are where you know, like no regrets. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=560.0s)]
*  Feel like everything I don't think I'm where I am because I've been masturbated. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=566.0s)]
*  I think it's I think I could have probably done other stuff and probably done it well when you think how many trades you could have learned. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=569.0s)]
*  OK, so what trade do you want to know that you would take some of your masturbation time? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=575.0s)]
*  Like because landscaping, something outdoors, you know, painting. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=579.0s)]
*  Now is the time for that when your libido falls back then. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=583.0s)]
*  You weren't going to go landscaping if you wanted to jerk off. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=586.0s)]
*  If I didn't have if I didn't have a libido, I think I would have done a lot of stuff. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=588.0s)]
*  I would have done someday. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=591.0s)]
*  Lose it probably, you know, and then that's when you get into like, but not these days. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=592.0s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no, these days you get the fake the men. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=596.0s)]
*  Now they get that you get a fake, you know, they have all these enhancers and everything. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=602.0s)]
*  They have all of this. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=607.0s)]
*  It's like, yeah, they're going to have you're basically just gonna have like 80 year old zombies wandering around. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=608.0s)]
*  But it doesn't it gets your dick hard, but it doesn't get your like heart hard. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=613.0s)]
*  So like guys, not heart or like your brain hard, you know, so guys will take it to fuck their wives if their wives, if they want to make them do it. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=617.0s)]
*  But they're not they're not propelled by sex with women. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=625.0s)]
*  So therefore you're not having to like feed this addiction, which is like the point like jerking off is really just like a porn addiction and just like, I feel good. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=628.0s)]
*  I don't want to feel my feelings. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=637.0s)]
*  So it's the easiest way. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=638.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's just one choice. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=639.0s)]
*  But when you don't have a libido later on, you're just going to put that obsession into like woodworking or whatever or, you know, canoeing or way of watching. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=641.0s)]
*  It would have just been nice to have pictures of myself like in a canoe or with like a nice statue I've done or something when I was younger. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=650.0s)]
*  You know, you didn't do any you have no accomplishments when you're young. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=656.0s)]
*  You weren't like an Eagle Scout or something. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=659.0s)]
*  You seem like you I didn't know how to like whittle or do a whistle. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=660.0s)]
*  OK, what's the deal if we had to do like a talent show and it couldn't be stand up and OK, podcasting or interviewing or go back to high school talent. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=664.0s)]
*  Let's let's do let's do a talent show like right now, Theo, like if you if we were in a talent show with a bunch of comedians and none of us could do comedy, what would yours be that you have the best shot of actually being considered like, oh my God, he's good at that. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=672.0s)]
*  Like, what do you have any secret? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=683.0s)]
*  I don't know. Nick might know even better than me. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=684.0s)]
*  I'm still stuck on one accomplishment. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=686.0s)]
*  You emancipate yourself when you're 14. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=689.0s)]
*  I'll get emancipated when I was a child. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=690.0s)]
*  So probably legal separation from family. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=691.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know how you're going to perform that at this talent show. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=694.0s)]
*  I think I could do it if we had like a small black box theater. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=697.0s)]
*  You know, again, it's a performance. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=700.0s)]
*  But yes, you're right. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=702.0s)]
*  I that is incredible. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=703.0s)]
*  So maybe I guess something like that. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=705.0s)]
*  Like, yeah, like I could probably do some Ileon Gonzalez type shit like, you know, like something like that. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=707.0s)]
*  I could probably do some Ileon Gonzalez reenactment. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=713.0s)]
*  Just let me get this straight. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=715.0s)]
*  You emancipated yourself from your parents when you were how old? [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=716.0s)]
*  14. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=719.0s)]
*  That's fucking badass. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=720.0s)]
*  Got out there. Yeah. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=721.0s)]
*  What can I just ask why? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=722.0s)]
*  Yeah, I just didn't like it there. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=724.0s)]
*  It just wasn't the best fit for me. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=725.0s)]
*  How did you know that it was even a possibility to do that? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=727.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=730.0s)]
*  I don't really remember. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=731.0s)]
*  I honestly don't remember what happened. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=732.0s)]
*  I remember. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=733.0s)]
*  Yeah, I remember we just, you know, do you have siblings? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=734.0s)]
*  That's how it came down to it. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=737.0s)]
*  Yeah, I got a couple of siblings. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=738.0s)]
*  Are you older, younger? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=739.0s)]
*  We're all in the cell a couple of years apart. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=741.0s)]
*  Wait, what? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=744.0s)]
*  I'm number two out of four. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=745.0s)]
*  Out of four. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=747.0s)]
*  Did they get out? Did they follow suit too? [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=748.0s)]
*  Nope. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=750.0s)]
*  They all, everybody, some people stayed in, some people got out. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=751.0s)]
*  It was basically almost like that, who's that guy that had that church out in Texas or whatever? [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=754.0s)]
*  Jeffs? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=762.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=763.0s)]
*  It was like Warren Jeffs, but it was just my mom. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=764.0s)]
*  Oh, shit, man. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=765.0s)]
*  You know? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=766.0s)]
*  Well, that is really- [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=767.0s)]
*  And I love you, Mom. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=768.0s)]
*  Happy Belated Mother's Day. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=769.0s)]
*  She knows that. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=770.0s)]
*  Do you have a relationship with her now? [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=771.0s)]
*  I'm sorry to ask. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=772.0s)]
*  Yeah, we got a relationship, but it's just- [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=773.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=774.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's like- [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=775.0s)]
*  Was he around? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=776.0s)]
*  No, he was not around. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=777.0s)]
*  Got it. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=778.0s)]
*  But I think it was just kind of like, you know, I think when you're like, I don't know, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=779.0s)]
*  it was more like, I think we were more like roommates and family kind of in a weird way. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=784.28s)]
*  Well, the fact that you were 14 and were able to do that, I mean, is incredible because [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=790.0s)]
*  I think that so often, I mean, I even have a hard time being like, doing, saying tough [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=795.48s)]
*  their family or doing something selfishly because your family, like just accepting that [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=803.76s)]
*  just because they're your family doesn't mean you have to put up with whatever they throw [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=808.52s)]
*  at you. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=812.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=813.0s)]
*  But then also sometimes I feel like, was I just like a weak kid who was just afraid to [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=814.0s)]
*  take the fucking brunt of it? [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=817.28s)]
*  That's so funny to frame it that way because in no way would anyone hear about a kid taking [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=818.76s)]
*  the initiative to, maybe you were stupid, maybe you were like, Mom and Dad, don't get [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=823.56s)]
*  her, like a kid could do that. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=826.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=828.16s)]
*  But to get- [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=829.16s)]
*  Yeah, that wasn't me. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=830.16s)]
*  I didn't have a skateboard, so that wasn't me. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=831.16s)]
*  But what happened and to actually legally do that, that's someone who realized I'm smarter [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=832.56s)]
*  than this and I know I need to get out and I need to protect myself. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=837.6s)]
*  It's very, I mean, that's very independent at a very young age. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=841.52s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's what it was, just independent. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=845.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=847.16s)]
*  And that's like, that's what did you do? [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=848.16s)]
*  Where did you go? [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=849.8s)]
*  What was your first- [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=850.8s)]
*  I went to stay with friends. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=851.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=852.8s)]
*  I went to stay with friends and then I would take my backpack to school and I would find [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=853.8s)]
*  friends to stay with, you know? [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=856.6s)]
*  So it was like kind of like this. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=858.4399999999999s)]
*  I think it was very avant-garde. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=861.04s)]
*  I don't know what that means actually. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=862.04s)]
*  Were you friends with everyone in high school? [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=863.04s)]
*  Avant-garde is kind of like, it's not the right use of it, but it gets the word, it [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=865.04s)]
*  gets the feel across. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=869.9599999999999s)]
*  So you were just fly by to see your parents kind of like, you were homeless. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=870.9599999999999s)]
*  I wasn't homeless. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=875.04s)]
*  I was staying with friends and then I finally found a friend who could let me stay full [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=876.04s)]
*  time. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=879.0s)]

*  wasn't a good dancer. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=934.04s)]
*  Like I got, I lost the show. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=935.04s)]
*  I was voted off first. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=937.04s)]
*  But when I walked in, he, you could see, he didn't know who I was. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=938.04s)]
*  We were meeting for the first time and you could see him be like, oh my God, yes, like [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=941.04s)]
*  she looks like she can do ballerina kind of. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=943.3199999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=946.3599999999999s)]
*  And then we did like a quick, like he wasn't even teaching me something. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=947.3599999999999s)]
*  And he's like, okay, let's, let's just, we did a quick thing. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=949.48s)]
*  And I saw him age, like 70, like his face dropped so severely of like he knew, he knew [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=952.0s)]
*  our fate because I just don't have like a natural talent. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=958.36s)]
*  So I would never try it out for cheerleaders because I wasn't like sex, cheerleaders are [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=960.76s)]
*  sexy. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=964.88s)]
*  I wasn't like ever trying to be sexy. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=965.88s)]
*  Are they though? [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=966.88s)]
*  Some cheerleaders were cute. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=967.88s)]
*  Well, there's like a perception of like anyone. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=968.88s)]
*  I didn't like to dance. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=971.04s)]
*  I didn't like to, I didn't want to do anything sexual. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=972.08s)]
*  I'm now realizing this as I say it. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=974.6800000000001s)]
*  That's why it was, I didn't have rhythm already. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=976.12s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=978.48s)]
*  But also it was mainly about like short skirts and being like, like having your belly out [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=979.48s)]
*  and like being like boys like me. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=983.6s)]
*  Like I didn't like boys and I loved boys, but I was just so scared of them. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=986.0s)]
*  And so I would never do anything to like draw attention to myself in that way. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=989.2s)]
*  And what were you scared of that they were going to be rapers or that they were going [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=992.84s)]
*  to be bad boys? [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=995.44s)]
*  Like I was going to be bad at making out or that I was, or like whatever we were doing [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=996.44s)]
*  that I would be bad at it and they would tell their friends and make fun of me. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1000.48s)]
*  Biggest fear because it's happens all the time. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1002.84s)]
*  Because I would hear stories of it constantly every day from my guy friends. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1005.12s)]
*  So I saw it happening around me. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1008.16s)]
*  I feel like being a girl, I couldn't imagine it being a girl when I was young. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1009.56s)]
*  That would be the toughest. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1013.64s)]
*  Yeah, it would suck. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1014.64s)]
*  I mean there's so many, I just didn't want the shit that came with hooking up with guys. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1015.64s)]
*  Maybe if I, one girl I remember she blew my crush. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1020.48s)]
*  Oh my God, I love this guy so much. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1023.88s)]
*  And she gave him a blow job and she threw up because he gagged her with it. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1025.48s)]
*  It's a normal thing to happen and sometimes can be kind of hot. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1029.44s)]
*  Yeah, some people have small windpipes. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1031.96s)]
*  Yeah, she was like high school girl giving deep, getting deep throated by a guy who just [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1033.76s)]

*  He was getting images that probably inspired that and then she threw up and then the story [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1041.5600000000002s)]
*  is like what an idiot she is, you know, and that's the whole story. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1045.2800000000002s)]
*  And I even perpetuated that. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1048.5600000000002s)]
*  Did you know that she threw up on his dick? [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1050.76s)]
*  Because it was just like to me girls sucking penises, it was just like a betrayal of to [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1052.3200000000002s)]
*  me as a woman. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1057.2s)]
*  Like I was just like, I can't believe I have to do that. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1058.2s)]

*  Right. You know, like, but also Native Americans, [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1508.08s)]
*  because that's like a Native American thing. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1510.96s)]

*  Because cigarettes do make you feel cool. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1667.08s)]
*  Vaping doesn't look as cool. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1669.36s)]
*  It does just because like younger people do it. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1671.76s)]

*  all she does is talk about sex. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1823.0s)]
*  She's just trying to shoehorn a sex story. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1824.1200000000001s)]
*  But this I actually think it's interesting. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1825.44s)]
*  But what I was going to say, what did you say? [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1828.0s)]
*  I worked at an ice cream store. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1829.44s)]
*  No, I worked at a pizza place and I worked at a nail salon. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1830.52s)]
*  Or my first job was at like a hair salon as like the receptionist. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1833.52s)]
*  And I did you have to sweep up the hair job and my no. Well, yes. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1838.3600000000001s)]
*  But I like was taking appointments and we used to write them. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1842.72s)]
*  And I cried so much on the job. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1844.76s)]
*  One day my tears splashed down and like totally ruined a whole appointment. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1846.48s)]
*  And like you couldn't read any of it. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1850.52s)]
*  And my boss had to comfort me. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1851.8000000000002s)]
*  And I I just left and never came back. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1853.1200000000001s)]
*  And she was calling my house trying to pay me. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1855.0s)]
*  And I was just like, I can't be seen there again. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1856.92s)]
*  Like I was just I would tell you in L.A. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1858.76s)]
*  When I was struggling, I was a nanny most of the time, [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1862.0s)]
*  because it's just like they trust you if you're like a woman who smiles. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1864.92s)]
*  Yeah, like they don't think you'll like hurt their kids. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1868.24s)]
*  It's all about the JPEG when it comes to nanny. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1870.8000000000002s)]

*  Yeah. Oh, yeah. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1877.44s)]
*  And like you want someone who has like, you know, references and stuff. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1878.3200000000002s)]
*  But I I was babysitting like with a service that would just dispatch you. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1882.2800000000002s)]
*  And it's so easy. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1885.92s)]
*  And I babysit for Judd Apatow. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1887.1200000000001s)]
*  Oh, really? A bit. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1889.76s)]
*  That was really cool. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1891.2800000000002s)]
*  And just like gave me like a reach out. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1892.6000000000001s)]

*  I don't know who you think I am. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1908.8s)]
*  Sorry, I'm not. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1910.04s)]
*  I cannot have sex with someone I like, like, let alone. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1911.6s)]
*  I'm very weird about sex. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1915.04s)]
*  I know I'm fascinated by your stuff with it as well, because I feel like [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1917.52s)]
*  I look at sugar babies or like only fans, girls and like [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1921.04s)]
*  thoughts and girls that are just like porn stars. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1924.36s)]
*  I like love them all. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1926.4s)]
*  And I don't know, like, [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1927.8000000000002s)]
*  but I'm still weird about putting that kind of stuff out there. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1931.52s)]
*  Oh, I remember first. Yeah. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1934.8000000000002s)]
*  When I even got that first blow job, I even remembered asking my buddy [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1935.96s)]
*  to go with me because I was nervous, you know? [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1939.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I guess guys are nervous, too. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1941.3200000000002s)]
*  I mean, I would assume you guys are more driven, but girls are like, [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1943.4s)]
*  I've got to get this out of the way. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1946.4s)]
*  I just I didn't give a blow job till I was a junior in college. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1947.3600000000001s)]
*  And all my friends, I was like they were all having sex relationships. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1950.6000000000001s)]
*  I was just like, I haven't even had sex. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1953.68s)]
*  I got to blow someone. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1955.32s)]
*  So I was just like, who was it? [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1956.4399999999998s)]
*  It was a comedian. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1958.04s)]
*  That that's the interesting part is I can't say who it was. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1959.08s)]
*  But it was it was see, I I was such a was he tall or short? [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1962.04s)]
*  Medium. Hmm. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1967.6399999999999s)]
*  I better know it is. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1969.72s)]
*  I'll tell you. I'll tell you who it is off air, but I can't say it on air. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1970.6799999999998s)]
*  I don't want to know off air. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1973.72s)]
*  Really? Yeah. OK. Well, good. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1975.2s)]
*  I'll tell you whatever you want to know, because I would trust you. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1977.76s)]
*  But I but I respect that you don't care. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1979.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I don't like knowing some of that kind of stuff. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1982.4s)]
*  You know, I agree. I am actually more mystery. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1984.5600000000002s)]
*  Well, I like to be able to imagine you blowing a couple of different people. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1988.28s)]
*  That I have. Like, I mean, my roster is crazy of people, you know, but like, [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1991.28s)]
*  but that's the thing. Everyone's going to be such a whore. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1995.68s)]
*  I literally I don't think you're a whore. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1997.88s)]
*  You're also an adult. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=1999.44s)]
*  It's not like you're a child who's who's like sneaking into people's houses. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2000.52s)]
*  And you are a regular adult and you can have sex. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2004.44s)]
*  I know. But if I were having a lot of sex, I would talk about it. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2007.0800000000002s)]
*  It seems like I do because I talk about sex a lot, but I don't like I haven't had sex in two years. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2009.52s)]
*  And like what? Yeah, we're going to get right into that. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2012.92s)]
*  Here's a woman right here that has a question. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2015.4s)]
*  She's obviously she's not doing well either. What's up? [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2016.76s)]
*  She's Australian. We can't hear. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2021.24s)]
*  She's so cute. What? You can't even hear her. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2025.76s)]
*  And, you know, you think she's Australian. What makes you think that? [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2027.8s)]
*  I just get an Aussie vibe from her. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2029.96s)]
*  I can only do one. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2034.8s)]
*  I can only do one. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2036.68s)]
*  Mr. Girl, can be over here in RAF Lake and Heath, England. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2038.28s)]
*  That's Royal Air Force Base. Oh, yeah. I've been there. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2042.32s)]
*  My question for Nikki is how and I'm sure you'll probably get five variations of the same question, [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2045.84s)]
*  but it's about coming up as a female comic. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2050.92s)]
*  So what I've always noticed is a lot of female comics will start out like their first, [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2054.88s)]
*  like, big hit gig is like a lot of sexual based humor. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2058.12s)]
*  And then as the other gigs continue, it's like a play off of the same gig. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2064.04s)]
*  And what what pressures do you feel? [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2071.2799999999997s)]
*  I guess it's like a female comic of like, [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2073.44s)]
*  if your humor is not sexual based, like, do people think you're not funny anymore? [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2076.36s)]
*  Or like, what is that trend about? I'm curious. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2080.7599999999998s)]
*  Obviously not a comic, but it's something I've noticed, you know, with female comics. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2083.4s)]
*  And does it seem like there's a lot of them when there are always always sexual based? [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2087.44s)]
*  Yeah, just curious. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2092.2799999999997s)]
*  Does it feel like that as a female comic? [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2093.64s)]
*  Thank you. That's a great question. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2095.12s)]
*  Gang gang. And I appreciate your service over there, too. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2097.0s)]
*  I actually did a show at RAF Lake and Heath one time. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2099.0s)]
*  It's a great backhanded question. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2101.6s)]
*  So what she was referencing is what a lot of people say is like all they talk about is sex. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2102.96s)]
*  And it's true because I mean, there's this documentary called Hysterical about female comics. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2107.7599999999998s)]
*  And it's the last thing I'm sure a lot of people want to watch. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2113.0s)]
*  And I'm in it. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2117.16s)]
*  And I did not expect this to be so fucking good and moving. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2118.16s)]
*  Like I learned I watched it and cried at my own story. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2121.6s)]
*  Like, I don't cry. And I was like, I saw myself as like, oh, my God, you're such a scared little girl [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2124.16s)]
*  who doesn't understand her worth. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2128.96s)]
*  And then I watched all these female comics that I'm friends with in this documentary. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2130.48s)]
*  It's so well done, Theo. You will actually really like it. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2134.64s)]
*  And it's one of I love documentaries. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2137.32s)]
*  It's really well done. And I would not I'm in a lot of shit. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2139.24s)]
*  And is it a real documentary that's on? [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2141.72s)]
*  We can see it somewhere now. Well, I'm yeah, it's called hysterical. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2143.64s)]
*  And it's FX and on Hulu. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2146.64s)]
*  But honestly, this is not I if I wasn't in it, I'd be promoting it. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2149.0s)]
*  If everyone had told to watch it, who you would think would be like not into that. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2153.12s)]
*  They fucking people have overheard me listening to it. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2156.88s)]
*  But anyway, I watch all my friends on there being like what drove them to stand up. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2159.32s)]
*  Judy Gold, Rachel Feinstein, Sherry Shepherd, Margaret Show. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2164.96s)]
*  Who else? Bonnie McFarlane, Marina Franklin, Fortune Feimster. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2170.04s)]
*  It's Lisa. Lisa Latham made it in. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2173.8s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. She's in it. I love her. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2176.56s)]
*  But we all and then the girl that stood up to Harvey Weinstein, [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2178.8s)]
*  Harvey Weinstein was at a fucking open mic or the show this girl was doing. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2182.4s)]
*  And she called him out. It was so brave. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2185.36s)]
*  It's it's fucking good. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2187.84s)]
*  But my point is female comics talk about sex. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2189.1600000000003s)]
*  At least it's presented in that documentary because we were like silenced [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2191.6800000000003s)]
*  about our bodies and like controlled about for so long that when you talk, [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2194.5600000000004s)]
*  you want to talk about like what you've been told you can't talk about. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2197.6400000000003s)]
*  But for me, when it comes to sex, I I've done Fallon [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2201.32s)]
*  like stand up on Fallon four or five times at this point. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2206.3199999999997s)]
*  I can do clean material. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2209.68s)]
*  I don't have to talk about sex and talk about sex in any of that. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2210.7599999999998s)]
*  That's and I've done I've done tons of like squeaky things. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2213.08s)]
*  And people go, oh, she's filthy. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2217.4399999999996s)]
*  The thing is, I talk about sex because I like it. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2219.7599999999998s)]
*  I'm not trying to talk about sex with you today because I am like trying to be [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2222.2s)]
*  like sexual or because I don't really I don't think I'm funny about anything else. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2225.72s)]
*  It's interesting. And no one's talking about it. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2229.24s)]
*  People still think, oh, everything's been talked about. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2231.56s)]
*  It's like, no, it hasn't. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2233.7999999999997s)]
*  I'm still encountering things that I'm like, I need someone to process this with me. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2235.32s)]
*  And for me, that is saying it on stage and having people laugh and go [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2238.88s)]
*  or have girls go, oh, my God, that happens to me, too. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2242.92s)]
*  I needed to hear that. And like empowering girls. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2244.84s)]
*  I just really want to do with stand up, talk about sex, [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2248.1200000000003s)]
*  because I want men to know how we're feeling and I want to understand how men are feeling. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2250.0800000000004s)]
*  So I want to express what I think men are feeling and hear if that's right or not. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2253.48s)]
*  Right. And like in B and make people feel better about it, because I'm just [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2257.36s)]
*  the reason I talk about sex is because I'm so fucking scared of sex and like [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2261.84s)]
*  so also want it, but also don't want it. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2264.7999999999997s)]
*  And it's like the most interesting thing. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2267.2799999999997s)]
*  Well, yeah. I mean, sex is an interesting thing. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2268.6s)]
*  It's really like a it's like I mean, it's how we get here also. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2270.52s)]
*  It's like you don't even exist if somebody doesn't have sex, you know. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2273.68s)]
*  So that's what the fact that it has so much magic in it. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2276.56s)]
*  I would be a sex therapist if I wasn't a comedian, if I didn't have like talent [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2279.56s)]
*  and what I would do, I would still work in the sex field. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2283.92s)]
*  Do you think that women don't get broad enough with their topics, though? [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2286.56s)]
*  No, I think talk about whatever the fuck you want. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2289.88s)]
*  You know, like anything I do now, that's what we're talking about, [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2292.04s)]
*  like hobbies and stuff and feeling you waste time when I do something now [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2295.32s)]
*  that feels like if I masturbate now, let's say, or do something that I'm like [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2298.96s)]
*  I'm trying to think of another or get a massage. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2302.72s)]
*  Like I'm getting a foot massage after this one. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2304.44s)]
*  Really, I maybe should work on some stuff I have to. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2305.84s)]
*  Yeah. But it's like those things is not a waste. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2307.96s)]
*  Like I want it or smoking weed when I probably shouldn't being like [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2310.52s)]
*  instead of being like smoking weed. This is so bad. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2315.0s)]
*  I'm just like, listen, I have a life where I choose what I get to do. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2316.84s)]
*  And so if I'm doing it, I must want to do it. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2321.52s)]
*  It must be serving me in some way. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2323.16s)]
*  So just cut the guilt and just enjoy it. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2324.36s)]
*  So that I have that approach now with sex stuff like I [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2327.84s)]
*  I will talk about whatever fascinates me, but sex still fascinates me. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2332.6s)]
*  And so it doesn't when my libido drops, when I'm doing stand up, when I'm 60, [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2336.04s)]
*  I probably won't be talking about fucking. Right. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2339.4s)]
*  Well, we can always check then, you know. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2342.2s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's tough sometimes. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2345.84s)]
*  I don't like talking about it because it just seems kind of vulgar to me sometimes. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2347.44s)]
*  So I like thinking about it sometimes, you know, [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2352.24s)]
*  but I don't like really I guess sometimes I don't like talking about it. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2355.4s)]
*  But I'm also like the vulgarity that makes you go. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2357.92s)]
*  But then that makes you feel shame about your right. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2360.68s)]
*  It breeds shame. You're right. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2363.04s)]
*  Like I'm I'm getting into talking about molestation on stage now. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2364.44s)]
*  Like I want to do like a fucking molestation chunk. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2368.04s)]
*  I have not been molested. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2370.68s)]
*  So as someone who hasn't been molested. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2371.8s)]
*  Oh, you got to get out there. I got to get. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2373.28s)]
*  Well, I'm going to therapy to find it because I feel like I have. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2375.08s)]
*  I'm so fascinated by molestation and what it does to people and [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2377.64s)]
*  and how much it's happening that we don't know about and how much it affects [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2380.56s)]
*  so many of my friends that have opened up to me about so many people were molested. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2383.7200000000003s)]
*  Everyone. It is Jesus. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2387.6400000000003s)]
*  I we just admit that everybody's molested. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2389.7200000000003s)]
*  And if you're molested, it wasn't your fault. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2392.56s)]
*  There's nothing you did. If you enjoyed it, it wasn't your fault. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2394.2000000000003s)]
*  If you went along with it, it wasn't your fault. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2396.76s)]
*  You were a kid. You forgive yourself. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2398.48s)]
*  It doesn't mean you're gay, even if you enjoyed it and you were with a man [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2400.6400000000003s)]
*  and now you're in a relationship. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2403.28s)]
*  Forgive yourself. Talk to someone about it. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2404.56s)]
*  I don't understand what that's like. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2406.6400000000003s)]
*  Do you ever wish that you were molested? You feel like. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2408.04s)]
*  I have a joke about it, like being like it would explain so much [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2410.08s)]
*  if I was able to go, oh, it's that because my uncle and that one time [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2413.6800000000003s)]
*  and my mom ignored it. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2417.6s)]
*  But I wasn't I was I mean, I was assaulted for my first kiss. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2419.0s)]
*  But in the scheme of things, it was very, very minor. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2422.4s)]
*  And but it scarred me to be scared of men and feel like they could just jump on me [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2425.08s)]
*  and I can't get them off of me and then they'll hate me. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2429.28s)]

*  I was telling my friend the other day, I was talking to this guy. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2956.32s)]

*  When this guy was going down on me and it was just not what I wanted. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2963.36s)]
*  It was going to work out, you know, but he was doing other things. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2966.76s)]
*  He was doing hand stuff that I was like, now that's good. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2969.36s)]
*  But the other stuff is just a distraction and I can't get there. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2971.4s)]
*  And then I was like, can I just use my vibrator? [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2974.6400000000003s)]
*  And he was like, sure. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2977.04s)]
*  And it was such a much better orgasm that I could have done alone with a vibrator. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2978.36s)]
*  So I did need him. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2981.88s)]
*  And it was much better than I could have done alone with him without. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2983.2400000000002s)]
*  Because we weren't I was not having sex with them. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2986.4s)]
*  So I was like, but you know, I'm saying men shouldn't be threatened by toys. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2987.8s)]
*  Are you threatened by them? [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=2991.12s)]

*  Yeah, the guy's having a good the guy's having a tough time. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3011.4s)]
*  And now you'll be able to help him out. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3013.84s)]
*  I think that that's good. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3015.04s)]
*  I think the guy can now have sex with his wife. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3015.88s)]
*  I think you're making my advice seem like too much, but I think it was fucking. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3018.8s)]
*  No. And I think your listeners are a lot of men need it. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3022.32s)]
*  They're going to need a lot of men need it. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3025.88s)]

*  OK, so what is something you can you admit something that you like here [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3040.96s)]
*  that maybe women would know that men like that is one of these things [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3044.1600000000003s)]

*  I learned about blow jobs, [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3092.56s)]
*  which I didn't know from my guy friends, is that a lot of girls start at like a 10. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3094.32s)]

*  Don't give them what you got. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3102.6800000000003s)]
*  Go to a four. Keep it at four. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3103.92s)]
*  Go back down to two. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3105.6000000000004s)]
*  So seven through ten for your wedding. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3106.84s)]
*  Save seven through ten for the future. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3108.84s)]
*  Just save it for the end. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3110.28s)]
*  Like I always went in really aggressive. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3111.6800000000003s)]
*  Like my first blow job was terrible. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3113.88s)]
*  My second, third foot, like I was so bad for so long. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3115.6000000000004s)]
*  And I probably am not that good. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3118.28s)]
*  But what really is good, I think, about a blow job is you just have to enjoy it. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3119.36s)]
*  So now I'm just like, I try to just go like, what do I want to do? [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3123.08s)]
*  Because if the guy thinks I'm having fun, he's going to think that he's like [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3125.72s)]
*  he's going to feel better about it. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3129.08s)]
*  What if a man, if you're given an oral and it's too fast, [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3130.56s)]
*  if a man tells you that, is that better? [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3135.24s)]
*  Yeah, too fast, too fast, too fast. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3137.0s)]
*  Yes, that's it. Oh, my God. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3138.92s)]
*  But then sometimes a girl will look at you like she doesn't want to go slower. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3140.36s)]
*  Like she's in a hurry. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3143.48s)]
*  No, no. Well, if someone can't understand that it feels better [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3144.6s)]
*  if you go slower and they're offended by that, that's not someone you should be with. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3148.36s)]
*  And if you're scared to communicate. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3152.44s)]
*  And I've been like that, Theo, I had a guy once going down on me [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3153.76s)]
*  and I was just like, that's not that's not. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3157.7200000000003s)]
*  And I was just like, if you do this right here, I had the solution. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3159.88s)]
*  You know, I was like, oh, my God, you know, it's like a massage. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3162.76s)]
*  You're like, no, no, no, no, up an inch or whatever. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3164.6s)]
*  And I was like, oh, my God. And he just goes, I got it. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3167.28s)]

*  But like, if it's true, we want to know what about this. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3449.08s)]

*  he would give his email to a girl like he'd see a girl in a park [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3469.2s)]

*  But like that is because he didn't give me his number. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3488.48s)]

*  with Dave Matthews in high school, like the feelings I felt for him were so intense that they really. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3706.48s)]
*  Yeah, until he opened his bus, like the urinal of the bus up over that bridge. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3711.7599999999998s)]
*  Remember that really kinky shit. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3715.64s)]

*  It's just like, I don't know. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3741.96s)]
*  That would have been a fun joke to make. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3744.68s)]
*  Do you think sometimes that as we get older, our brains get a little less acute for making jokes? [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3747.24s)]
*  Have you started to notice that? [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3753.12s)]

*  Oh, I see. Like if they painted green for St. Patrick's Day, it's brown for. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3758.24s)]

*  And then I go like racial jokes, right? [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3770.2s)]
*  And then I can't make any of those. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3772.7599999999998s)]

*  And but you're right. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3776.44s)]
*  I feel like as I get older, yeah, we're getting slowly like more stupid. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3778.3599999999997s)]
*  Sometimes I wonder if my brain gets a little less acute sometimes. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3782.7999999999997s)]
*  You're you're busting out limousine of rats. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3785.52s)]

*  And he just goes, it's like his brain works. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3800.6s)]
*  It's like I go, it's just he's just so you're well known as someone who is just like [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3804.96s)]
*  Justin and I were actually talking about you. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3811.64s)]
*  It wasn't just like, but we were talking about you the other night and just saying, like, [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3813.52s)]
*  how like your did your so that your talent is so unique and like you've always been that way. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3816.2799999999997s)]
*  But it's just like it's just so cool to see you just like really refine it. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3823.48s)]
*  And I just love watching you and you're so funny. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3828.2799999999997s)]
*  But I don't think you're you will get more demented. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3830.52s)]
*  You're peeking. But it's downhill from here because, you know, like, well, Gary Shanley, [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3832.72s)]
*  did you watch that thing? [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3837.68s)]
*  The Judd Apatow documentary, the three parter. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3839.4s)]
*  It's so good. But you see this guy that is a genius kind of start to lose his mind. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3842.96s)]
*  What happened to him? You know, he was starting to get paranoid about things like who knows what it was. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3847.88s)]
*  I forget what happened. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3852.96s)]
*  I think his health was deteriorating. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3854.28s)]
*  And so his brain as a result of those things, I forget that it could have been a specific [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3855.92s)]
*  thing that was leading to this. But he's you know, there's a scene of him on Conan later on in his life [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3860.32s)]
*  before his death where he's just not sharp. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3865.48s)]
*  And it's like talk. You feel like you're watching your uncle being interviewed, like that has good jokes. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3869.44s)]
*  But like, it's just the timings off. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3873.96s)]
*  And it's like this. It's sad to see. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3875.44s)]
*  And I know it goes. If I spoke too much pot, my my my jokes don't get worse. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3878.6800000000003s)]
*  But my memory for what the fuck I'm talking about gets worse. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3884.2000000000003s)]
*  So it gets more like disjointed. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3887.48s)]
*  So that's I I I definitely feel deteriorating from just like not sleeping from do you feel that way? [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3889.68s)]
*  I think sometimes. Yeah, I just did. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3897.92s)]
*  I just went through a ketamine therapy, too. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3900.0s)]
*  I just did a therapy for like two weeks. Yeah. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3901.64s)]
*  Oh, my God. Wait, when did you do that? [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3904.12s)]
*  Is a little I felt a little so even in this conversation, I felt a little. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3906.04s)]
*  Theo, I wish I would have known that. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3910.84s)]
*  Wait, what can you just quickly tell me what led you to do that and what it was? [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3912.56s)]
*  Yeah. What led me to do it? [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3916.8s)]
*  I met this lady and she had done it. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3918.16s)]
*  And so I'm asking like, why do you need ketamine therapy? [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3920.3199999999997s)]
*  Oh, because I was having so much pain. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3924.3999999999996s)]
*  I was literally having so much physical pain from stress that I was like, [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3927.3599999999997s)]
*  I have to try something different. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3932.3199999999997s)]
*  So I just wanted to try something new, you know. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3933.3999999999996s)]
*  And so ketamine for this for physical pain, because they know it's mental. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3937.04s)]
*  Well, because I feel like it's definitely psychosomatic pain. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3942.3999999999996s)]
*  It comes literally from stress, from like things, from thoughts and like [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3945.0s)]
*  stressful moments that it happens. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3949.0800000000004s)]
*  Have you read the back pain book, Sarno? [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3950.44s)]
*  It's all about that. Like, I will read it sometime, but. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3952.84s)]
*  But I'm just saying, I probably won't read it. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3955.5600000000004s)]
*  I know you won't. But let me just say it's a book that has healed so many. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3957.0400000000004s)]
*  My back pain included. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3960.84s)]
*  You read it and you learn that you're I don't have any back pain. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3962.28s)]
*  But you know, whatever you were trying to treat, [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3964.88s)]
*  the fact that you were able to acknowledge like this is stress [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3967.48s)]
*  and I need to treat the stress, not the physical element. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3969.6800000000003s)]
*  People are getting back surgeries. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3972.48s)]
*  And it's all because it's their subconscious mind is like rerouting pain [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3973.8s)]
*  that they don't want to feel up here to the weakest parts of their skeleton. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3978.0s)]
*  So your bulging disc is not supposed to hurt as bad as it does. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3980.68s)]
*  It is there, but you don't need surgery on it. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3983.7200000000003s)]
*  You need to just acknowledge that it's stress. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3986.16s)]
*  You don't even need to fix the stress. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3988.48s)]
*  You just acknowledge that it is and it will it will go away. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3989.96s)]
*  But then you slowly treat it. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3992.92s)]
*  But ketamine therapy, is your pain gone now? [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3994.4s)]
*  Well, a couple of things happen. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3997.32s)]
*  I mean, I feel like it has been going away. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=3998.56s)]
*  I also quit caffeine about two and a half weeks ago. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4000.52s)]
*  OK, Theo, I try and both those things right now. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4003.36s)]
*  I am totally obsessed with caffeine addiction because I am addicted to it. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4006.2s)]
*  And I know you asked about my ZVs if they were caffeine. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4010.2s)]
*  So I did note that early on. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4012.24s)]
*  Caffeine addiction is from my [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4015.24s)]
*  I tried to quit caffeine for 20 minutes [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4018.68s)]
*  and was like felt like I had covid because of the symptoms of like in the morning, [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4021.44s)]
*  like the depression, just malaise with lethargy. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4025.0s)]
*  It's the star. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4029.68s)]
*  I think it's lethargy, but lethargy, too, if you want to say it that way, [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4031.8799999999997s)]
*  which is wrong, but that's fine. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4035.4399999999996s)]
*  But you did you experience that? [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4038.48s)]
*  Did you experience like how did you do? [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4040.3599999999997s)]
*  I have been tired. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4042.08s)]
*  I think I think I've been tired from not some of the caffeine, but also I feel [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4043.3599999999997s)]
*  I definitely feel like some of the the the acute pain from the stress going away. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4047.72s)]
*  So that feels pretty good. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4053.0s)]
*  And then the ketamine thing, some of it was cool. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4054.12s)]
*  Like some of it got a little scary. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4056.08s)]
*  I was kind of glad when it was over. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4057.3599999999997s)]
*  I was like, what? How does it go? [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4058.56s)]
*  It's just like you go, they hook you up to an IV. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4059.84s)]
*  You're in there with a therapist. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4061.64s)]
*  This you just start talking about stuff. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4062.6s)]
*  And then you like your brain kind of goes through like these warp zones and stuff. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4064.2799999999997s)]
*  And you literally I mean, it got way. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4068.24s)]
*  I mean, I remember at one point, I thought it was a cryptocurrency like you get. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4070.7999999999997s)]
*  You go pretty deep. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4074.64s)]
*  You might be a little bit slower than you normally are, but you didn't affect your. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4075.7599999999998s)]
*  I love that. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4080.72s)]
*  I'm clearly seeing that whatever you did did not affect how funny you are [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4081.68s)]
*  in the way your brain works, because I think so many people are scared. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4085.08s)]
*  They treat this stuff. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4088.0400000000004s)]
*  They won't be as funny. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4089.2400000000002s)]
*  Well, I just wanted to try it like I feel like I'm healthy enough to try it. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4090.6800000000003s)]
*  I'm healthy enough to have an experience from it. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4093.1200000000003s)]
*  You know, in the end, I still feel probably like, [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4095.1600000000003s)]
*  you know, a lot of my stuff is spiritual in nature [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4098.400000000001s)]
*  and I probably just need to have a relationship with a higher power for myself. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4100.92s)]
*  Do you? But I could be better for sure. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4104.08s)]
*  I mean, I have one, but it certainly could be, you know, I just got one, too. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4106.84s)]
*  A good day to day practice and like, or I've been trying to have one [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4110.12s)]
*  within a like about over a year and like accept a god or higher power [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4115.56s)]
*  or like admit that I'm not in control of all the things. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4120.8s)]
*  And that's kind of like about the acceptance of like, OK, I want to masturbate. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4124.2s)]
*  So I'm masturbating. I want to smoke weed. OK, I'm smoking weed. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4127.4800000000005s)]
*  Like the gentleness of like, do you not? [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4129.88s)]
*  You're not in control. Just do just be. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4133.0s)]
*  And and the higher power thing and being raised as an atheist. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4135.84s)]
*  I don't know how you were. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4139.24s)]
*  I always raised as atheist, really. Yeah, like we were raised with much. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4140.16s)]
*  But we didn't. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4144.08s)]
*  I just picked up things from around the neighborhood. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4145.0s)]
*  You know, Lowe's religion. Really? Yeah. Oh, yeah. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4147.08s)]
*  And like, you know, like if you believe in God, you're probably dumber. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4151.6s)]
*  And you like those are the things I kind of grew up with. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4155.84s)]
*  Like I my parents would watch to catch me watching Seventh Heaven. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4158.12s)]
*  They'd be like, what's going on here? [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4161.32s)]
*  Go memorize some fucking Marilyn Manson lyrics or something, you know, like, [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4163.28s)]
*  they they would be like disappointed. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4167.16s)]
*  I would go to Christian Young Life Camp because it was just a flirt with boys. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4168.84s)]
*  My friends and I like singing songs. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4172.2s)]
*  I like singing Sweet Caroline, but like, yeah, those moments. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4174.0s)]
*  And they were just like, you know, it's Christian. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4178.44s)]
*  And so now I feel really weird being like telling my parents. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4182.32s)]
*  I believe my parents, I was living with my parents over the summer. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4184.36s)]
*  And I was so depressed that I was started praying because I just had no hope left. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4187.12s)]
*  I was when you mentioned ketamine, I was like, tell me about it, [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4190.88s)]
*  because I was so depressed that I called Neil Brennan being like, oh, yeah, [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4193.4s)]
*  I called Gary Goldman, actually being like I was about to call Neil, [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4197.2s)]
*  but it didn't get that desperate. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4200.44s)]
*  But I called Gary Goldman being like, I'm going to check myself in somewhere [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4201.8s)]
*  because I'm fucking want to kill myself. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4204.68s)]
*  Like, I'm not going to. But yeah, it's bad. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4207.0s)]
*  My brain is turned against me. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4209.0s)]
*  And because my parents, I'm living with my parents. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4210.24s)]
*  They're like, you hosted Kimmel last week. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4212.5199999999995s)]
*  You have all these tour dates. Everyone's like you have. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4214.32s)]
*  You're doing nothing. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4216.64s)]
*  There's nothing that spurred this. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4217.5199999999995s)]
*  And it's like, I don't know what's going on here. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4219.08s)]
*  But I got caught praying one day because I was trying to talk to a higher power, [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4221.44s)]
*  trying to just like act as if there is. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4225.76s)]
*  Oh, yeah. OK. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4228.24s)]
*  Act as if, yeah. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4229.04s)]
*  I'm like a little Mormon like girl. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4230.0s)]
*  Like, I don't know how to pray. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4234.4s)]
*  So I get on my bed. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4235.48s)]
*  Doesn't it feel like something? [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4236.08s)]
*  I feel like when I put something like if I talk inside of myself [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4237.48s)]
*  subconsciously to a higher power and I'm not saying your higher power [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4242.88s)]
*  is to be any specific religion, I'm saying anything like that. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4246.48s)]
*  Yeah. But if you do that, I feel like something hears me. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4248.96s)]
*  Yeah, it does. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4252.92s)]
*  And I feel like it's that I don't think that's a crazy thing. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4253.92s)]
*  I haven't always felt like that in my whole life. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4256.92s)]
*  You know, I but I feel it's like it does. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4259.04s)]
*  I can't believe I'm nice because then the life every day isn't just my responsibility. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4262.12s)]

*  which as someone who didn't believe in God and like to accept that, [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4277.24s)]
*  there's someone looking out for me and that always is with me, [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4279.96s)]
*  even when I'm like having a relapse or like always, you know, I, I kind of [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4283.0s)]

*  And just like then I the behavior doesn't it doesn't affect you so much. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4304.16s)]

*  and I feel like that helps me of like, hey, can you not help me? [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4318.5199999999995s)]

*  Yeah. But it just feels like in this, it feels like some [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4337.92s)]
*  to have some connection to some other to a higher source just feels like. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4342.04s)]
*  I don't know. It used to seem like it was part of life so much more. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4347.16s)]
*  You know, if you go back to Native Americans, like their spirit animal, [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4349.84s)]

*  like you're saying. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4370.24s)]
*  But it's not very rewarding, though. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4371.16s)]
*  I don't think it gives us much of a reward. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4372.84s)]
*  Sometimes I'm on Instagram and I'm scrolling and I just go, you know what? [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4374.68s)]

*  as an adult woman and I never was diagnosed with it. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4417.52s)]
*  But I went and got like, you know, you're on the med now. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4419.68s)]

*  Now than I was the summer. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4603.8s)]
*  He had many others. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4605.12s)]
*  There's a lot of good stuff out there. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4606.2s)]
*  You know, there's a lot of junk out there, too. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4607.639999999999s)]
*  You know, that's a tough thing. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4609.88s)]
*  Oh, yes. And he might be like, no, I don't say he is. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4611.8s)]
*  I'm just saying that there's a lot of junk. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4615.08s)]
*  Like, I know that I fall for shit all the time. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4616.5199999999995s)]
*  Oh, yeah. You know, I didn't fall for that. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4619.48s)]
*  Gwyneth Paltrow thing that everyone was passing around with the vajandals or whatever. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4622.16s)]
*  No, she said there was some headline the other day that was like [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4625.84s)]
*  through the pandemic has been really tough. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4628.76s)]
*  One night, I even had to eat bread and everyone's going, [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4630.72s)]
*  oh, my God, I lost my grandfather, but it was fake. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4633.360000000001s)]
*  She didn't say that. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4636.200000000001s)]
*  I'm not shocked. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4638.04s)]
*  Yeah, the see that that's the thing. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4639.4800000000005s)]
*  She maybe said a comment, but they're like, it's not real. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4640.76s)]
*  Well, nothing in the news. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4643.6s)]
*  None of this is real. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4644.96s)]
*  But I am. Sam Harris is someone that is like his app is so helpful for [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4645.8s)]
*  if you're going through depression or just existential crisis. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4650.12s)]
*  But and the fact that there's no free will is really helped me to. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4653.88s)]
*  Well, I think what do you mean? [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4657.84s)]
*  There's no free will, you mean? [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4660.44s)]
*  Look into it. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4663.52s)]
*  If you read Sam Harris's book, Free Will, [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4664.92s)]
*  the concept that you have any control over anything you do, [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4668.24s)]
*  you want to talk about you're not in control of your own life. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4671.2s)]
*  You're really not, because it's too much of a concept. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4674.16s)]
*  This might if by any, by the way, this freaks anyone out right now. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4677.68s)]
*  The idea that you're not in control of your life, because the fact is, you're not. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4681.28s)]
*  That scares you. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4686.28s)]
*  You should probably not trigger warning because some people with like psych [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4687.04s)]
*  psychiatric diseases like illnesses can't handle this. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4689.92s)]
*  But basically, free will doesn't the idea that you are controlling anything you do, [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4693.12s)]
*  the idea that I'm like, oh, I'm going to pet that rat. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4698.56s)]
*  And I did it. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4700.4s)]
*  OK, yes, I had the thought, though, of I'm going to put that rat. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4702.08s)]
*  Did I choose that thought? [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4705.32s)]
*  Did I go I could do anything right now and I'm going to go choose? [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4706.88s)]
*  No, it just popped in my head. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4709.52s)]
*  So anything that you can argue as a choice is a thought that popped in your head [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4710.88s)]
*  that you did not that you pulled out of nowhere. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4714.08s)]
*  You didn't choose or your parents were. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4716.0s)]
*  You didn't choose that your heart's beating much like those other things. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4717.6s)]
*  You don't choose what you think. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4721.5599999999995s)]
*  And everything you do is based on what you think. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4723.08s)]
*  So if you're not choosing what you think, there's it's either completely random [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4725.24s)]
*  or it's determinism, which is like it's already laid out. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4728.92s)]
*  Does that make sense? [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4732.76s)]
*  I mean, it slightly makes some sense. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4733.92s)]
*  I mean, I think it sounds it just sounds like more that it sounds like a bigger [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4735.32s)]
*  thing that we'd have to unpack. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4738.84s)]
*  You know, it sounds like a bigger. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4740.12s)]
*  That's the basics. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4741.16s)]
*  And if anyone's interested, just I'm serious. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4741.92s)]
*  Look into because it really helped me. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4743.92s)]
*  Right. This concept. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4746.12s)]
*  And I didn't know it was a thing. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4747.36s)]
*  It's it's a short book called Free Will by Sam Harris. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4748.24s)]
*  I could see it taking a lot of pressure off of people because then it's like [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4750.4400000000005s)]
*  you're the decisions and the choices you make are not as [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4753.4400000000005s)]
*  they're not your fault. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4759.08s)]
*  They're not going to hamper yourself as much. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4760.12s)]
*  Well, nothing's your fault. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4762.0s)]
*  Like when they open up, this is a great example he gives in the book. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4763.12s)]
*  When they open up a guy that shoots up a fucking mall or something and they [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4765.96s)]
*  how could you do a strip? [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4772.32s)]
*  My shoes up a strip mall. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4774.0s)]
*  They open up his brain, they do an autopsy and they find, oh my God, there is a [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4775.16s)]
*  giant tumor on his amygdala. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4778.44s)]
*  I'm just making up. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4780.16s)]
*  I don't know if that it completely explains why this otherwise normal man had [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4780.759999999999s)]
*  this complete shift and shot up the mall. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4784.88s)]
*  Actually, he would probably get a different charge because of that. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4788.2s)]
*  Right. Because it wasn't his fault. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4791.679999999999s)]
*  It was his brain. It was a tumor. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4792.679999999999s)]
*  Right. It's a it's not premeditated. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4793.799999999999s)]
*  Right. Even if you planned it, it wasn't his fault as tumor. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4796.28s)]
*  We have some sympathy for that guy in a way that we don't have for a Jeffrey [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4798.4s)]
*  Dahmer, right? Or a Ted Bundy who whether or not they open their brain and [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4801.92s)]
*  found something, we just go that guy plans these things. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4806.48s)]
*  He's a crazy person. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4809.599999999999s)]
*  When really Ted Bundy didn't want to be born with he didn't choose the brain [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4810.599999999999s)]
*  that made him a serial killer. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4814.96s)]
*  And you go, well, if I were Ted Bundy, I wouldn't have done that. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4816.4s)]
*  Yes, you would have. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4819.16s)]
*  Because everyone does exactly what they're going to do. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4820.2s)]
*  And there's no it gives you an immense empathy. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4823.16s)]
*  And I'm not saying I forgive child molesters or murderers or someone who [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4826.679999999999s)]
*  could hurt my family. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4831.12s)]
*  I would be furious because that's just human nature. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4832.5199999999995s)]
*  But I understand that when I think of child molesters, I kind of I'm so angry [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4835.639999999999s)]
*  at what they do and disgusted by it. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4841.0s)]
*  But there's a part of me that's like no one would choose to be born with a [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4842.44s)]
*  bro. Yeah. I think some of that there's a lot of sympathy. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4846.32s)]
*  They need to get help and do what they need to get help. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4848.759999999999s)]
*  But there's a lot of that. I go, they didn't choose that. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4851.2s)]
*  And people have a hard time. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4853.759999999999s)]
*  That's a really weird concept. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4855.44s)]
*  But if you break it down, everything is something that's weird in your brain. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4857.04s)]
*  So whether it's a tumor or just your brain's weird and we can't really see [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4860.36s)]
*  what's weird, it's still not your fault. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4863.28s)]
*  It's your brain. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4865.2s)]
*  Well, I think some of that will be interesting as we learn, you know, just [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4866.28s)]
*  as we evolve more and learn more and we start to see like, [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4868.639999999999s)]
*  you know, empathy is such a big thing, you know, and just how much [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4873.32s)]
*  are you good with it? [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4877.12s)]
*  I think I'm pretty good with it, honestly, a lot of times, because I've always felt [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4878.04s)]
*  that way. The way you're talking about like even my friends that have gotten [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4880.92s)]
*  trouble for sex stuff, like our friends that have gotten trouble, like [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4883.44s)]
*  I usually always think like, well, what happened to them? [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4886.28s)]
*  You know, like, how did it start? [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4888.24s)]
*  Like, yeah, that's great. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4889.639999999999s)]
*  But I mean, it still doesn't take away. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4891.48s)]
*  Also, though, also, though, you live in an environment and a society [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4893.599999999999s)]
*  and society is shaped where people have to have punishments sometimes. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4897.759999999999s)]
*  And and and and things that happen. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4901.16s)]
*  And sometimes some people need to go back into the broth, man. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4903.759999999999s)]
*  I get it. And I understand that we want to punish people and say like you, [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4906.44s)]
*  you hurt my friend. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4911.4800000000005s)]
*  I'm going to hurt you. I for an eye. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4912.68s)]
*  But really, the reason we put these people away is because they harm society. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4914.240000000001s)]
*  And it's not it's not an example to people to not do that. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4917.92s)]
*  But it's it's it's not so much retribution because we should just be like, [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4921.92s)]
*  wow, that sucks that he's a serial killer and his brain is like that. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4925.56s)]
*  And we put them away. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4928.200000000001s)]

*  But or not. But I'm just going to have so much. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4941.36s)]
*  But I love that. Yeah. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4943.68s)]
*  I'll do it. I'm Tinders. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4945.08s)]
*  Oh, you don't like them. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4947.4s)]
*  You can't eat them, huh? [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4949.32s)]
*  It's all I can. I won't. OK. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4950.84s)]

*  Yeah, it's not harming an animal. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4967.8s)]
*  I mean, you're doing now that is to be that. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4970.52s)]
*  Listen, a couple of my early ones, my first one might have harmed [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4973.08s)]
*  a fellow human because I didn't know what to do with my teeth. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4976.52s)]
*  But no, calm is like that's fine. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4979.4s)]
*  You can see most people call it seed. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4983.16s)]
*  Most people call common seed or semen. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4985.32s)]
*  I don't go give me your I want your seed. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4988.6s)]
*  But I feel like calm is the is the one really? [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4991.36s)]
*  Yeah, I call it common. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4994.96s)]
*  When you're in bed with a girl and you say, I'm going to [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4996.24s)]
*  can you take my can you just my seed? [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=4998.56s)]
*  What do you say? Or I'm going to seed. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5000.280000000001s)]
*  I'm going to plant. Yeah. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5002.240000000001s)]
*  I'm going to harvest. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5004.200000000001s)]
*  Maybe. I'm sorry. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5006.52s)]
*  I think I'm no, I'll keep it going. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5008.200000000001s)]
*  So, yeah, I don't eat. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5010.200000000001s)]
*  I don't eat animals because I love animals. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5012.92s)]
*  Now, what if you met an animal? [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5015.84s)]
*  And he's violent, he's killing other animals, stuff like that. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5018.68s)]
*  He's like, I can kill him. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5020.88s)]
*  But he's a Jeffrey Dahmer of animals. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5021.96s)]
*  Still, we have to kill him because he's killing other animals. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5023.76s)]
*  He's his sacrifice will be less than how much harm he could put in the world. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5026.24s)]
*  See, that's one of the things overall. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5029.76s)]
*  So we have to do things just for the greater good of everything. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5030.96s)]
*  That's what putting people in jail is for is. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5033.16s)]
*  But like, would you believe in the death penalty then? [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5035.639999999999s)]
*  No. I mean, by by these by this logic, no, because. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5038.2s)]
*  But I I believe in it because if I got that life sentence, I would [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5041.92s)]
*  I would really want to be put to death. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5046.24s)]
*  Oh, please. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5048.48s)]
*  I believe in it just like as I'm I'm advocating for the prisoners [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5049.8s)]
*  to like have that option, like just I don't even care [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5053.44s)]
*  if the machine your chair's not working. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5056.16s)]
*  Let's just do a shoot me. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5057.76s)]
*  Like I would rather I like when the world ends and the wave comes, [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5061.2s)]
*  I just want to have a I want to have a gun just so I can like kill myself [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5063.92s)]
*  before some natural disaster. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5066.5199999999995s)]
*  I believe a better way to go than. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5068.84s)]
*  Hopefully, I think some prisoners will wise up [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5070.72s)]
*  and they will get the option to have the death penalty. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5073.28s)]
*  Yeah. And some of them would choose. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5076.12s)]
*  People are so scared of death. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5078.44s)]
*  It would be better to go back into the. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5079.4s)]
*  Amoeba or the the sphere that the [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5082.639999999999s)]
*  and have a new shot at a ret at a retribution of existence. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5085.92s)]
*  Then it would be here and piddled around like writing letters to the girl. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5090.12s)]
*  You murdered movies. Yeah. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5093.759999999999s)]
*  And just be some because then you're just part of some [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5095.5599999999995s)]
*  get a documentary that some creep is going to make [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5098.88s)]
*  because they don't make money off the. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5102.04s)]
*  I watched those YouTube videos of like them interviewing sociopaths. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5103.48s)]
*  I love sociopaths and psychopaths. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5106.639999999999s)]
*  I just what's a murder you could do and be honest with me. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5109.16s)]
*  OK, Bill Cosby, you could do right. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5112.04s)]
*  I could probably strangle him. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5115.759999999999s)]
*  Oh, you could kill him. You mean? Yeah. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5117.92s)]
*  I'm talking about what's a murder you could commit. Oh. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5119.92s)]
*  Like what's a good crime that then? [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5122.88s)]
*  But I would love to just see his eyes pop out even more as I slowly [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5124.84s)]
*  choke the life out of him for being probably a murderer and the most prolific [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5128.679999999999s)]
*  serial rapist that any of us have ever known. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5133.32s)]
*  A murder I could do a gun, you know, like if there was a burglar [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5136.4s)]
*  or something like I could stab someone, I could [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5140.719999999999s)]
*  I could do anything in self-defense. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5143.88s)]
*  I wouldn't like my dad always says if a guy you're in a car with a guy [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5145.08s)]
*  and you he's taking you in an undisclosed location, [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5148.8s)]
*  you're going to get murdered, right? [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5153.28s)]
*  If a guy grabs you and shoves you in a car and you're screaming, [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5154.12s)]
*  don't don't try to like hang out for the car ride wherever you're going. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5157.0s)]
*  You're going to get murdered. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5160.16s)]
*  I got to jump out. So just try to wreck the car even if you're on a highway. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5161.08s)]
*  But the best thing to do if you can is like gouge their eyes. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5164.28s)]
*  And that would be hard for me to do just to feel it. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5166.72s)]
*  But actually, I feel great to someone like that is about to rape and murder. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5168.4s)]
*  You just go and like dig as far as you can. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5171.08s)]
*  And you have to do it. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5173.64s)]
*  And then the car will flip, but you have a better chance of surviving that. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5174.4800000000005s)]
*  Then he's not going to take you to go do a podcast, you know, like you're [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5177.0s)]
*  you're going to it's going to be bad. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5181.240000000001s)]
*  See, that's one thing I think that's tough for a lot of women is you have that [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5183.52s)]
*  that chance out there of getting sexually assaulted. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5186.72s)]
*  You have the chance to get like if somebody picks me up, [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5189.280000000001s)]
*  they just are going to want to either spend time with me or give me a ride. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5192.160000000001s)]
*  That's what I'm saying about the run. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5195.400000000001s)]
*  But hold on, Theo. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5196.52s)]
*  This brings us to one of the one of the moments I'll never forget about you [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5197.72s)]
*  that I had on the street in front of the improv on Melrose. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5202.2s)]
*  Do you remember you were coming back from your car? [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5205.36s)]
*  I was leaving the Melrose improv. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5208.08s)]
*  It was probably like 2017 and I was on a jog. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5209.96s)]
*  No, you were you were coming back. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5214.48s)]
*  You went like you were maybe coming. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5216.5599999999995s)]
*  Wait, hold on. I was walking that way. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5218.5599999999995s)]
*  You were. Yeah, you were coming back to the improv from your car [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5220.0s)]
*  or maybe going to get something or maybe you were coming for the first time. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5223.5199999999995s)]
*  I go, Hi, Theo. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5225.599999999999s)]
*  And I see you. I pass you on the sidewalk. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5226.88s)]
*  We're kind of further down. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5228.28s)]

*  Yeah. And then also, like, it's up to me whether or not I get raped is the other kind. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5261.2s)]
*  It's a funny thing to say, because it's like, you know, that's a big reach. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5266.16s)]
*  You know, I'm saying, but but just being like, don't get it's just saying something [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5268.84s)]
*  flippant about a thing that I actually fear every time I leave there. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5272.4s)]
*  Right. But you didn't know that. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5275.0s)]
*  And so it was me going like, I go, thanks. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5276.28s)]
*  And I'm in my car just like, oh, God, that was not a fun. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5278.72s)]
*  I didn't care. I really did get to a place of like, he doesn't know. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5281.599999999999s)]
*  He doesn't know the experience of being a woman and like, didn't know about it. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5284.96s)]
*  It was just we were like, you were like, we were awkward almost. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5287.5599999999995s)]
*  You were just like, hi. And just like said something. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5290.4s)]
*  We all do that. So I forgive you. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5292.12s)]
*  But then you texted me right after it. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5293.5199999999995s)]
*  We're like, hey, I'm really sorry. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5295.12s)]
*  That felt so weird. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5296.839999999999s)]
*  And that wasn't cool to say. And I should have walked you. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5297.92s)]
*  You like said all the nice things in a text, like right after. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5299.599999999999s)]
*  And that was meant a lot to me. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5302.679999999999s)]
*  But and I could tell that you were like, but yeah, just walk in my car next time. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5304.4s)]
*  Yeah. Do you walk girls across? [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5308.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I'll walk girls to cars. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5310.5599999999995s)]
*  I'll make sure they get in the vehicles, get girls, Ubers, you know. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5311.92s)]
*  Yeah, I think I do all that kind of stuff. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5316.5599999999995s)]
*  I don't know why I said it. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5318.8s)]
*  Maybe I thought that it was just a good maybe this the environment was right for the joke. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5319.52s)]
*  Now it is because also I'm a comic and that's a funny joke. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5323.72s)]
*  Well, that's a tough thing, too. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5327.08s)]
*  When you're talking with comics, it's like and it's like that's the thing that sucks about the world. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5328.0s)]
*  It sucks that you couldn't make a race joke a few minutes ago without everybody thinking you're a fucking racist. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5332.04s)]
*  Yeah, you just have to and you kind of can. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5336.0s)]
*  It's like you don't have to be. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5338.320000000001s)]
*  But I might catch someone in a vulnerable state like you caught me in a vulnerable state. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5339.88s)]
*  Right. I was already thinking about being raped and I might say a race joke. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5343.56s)]
*  And it catches someone who is watching who is black and was discriminated against today all day today. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5346.64s)]
*  They didn't get something because they are black. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5351.200000000001s)]
*  That it's just they know it. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5352.92s)]
*  And then they hear me say a racial joke. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5354.56s)]
*  And it just makes them go like, God, another fucking thing like right. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5356.08s)]
*  It can catch someone in the wrong time. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5361.160000000001s)]
*  I agree. But then we've gotten to this space in the world where it's like, oh, run up. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5362.64s)]
*  But I also I want a career. Right. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5365.72s)]
*  And I want to be able to say things because we have to do things that's for the common good. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5367.84s)]
*  Like it's gotten to this point where it's like you're never going to make everybody on Twitter happy. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5371.68s)]
*  Everybody has a voice now. It's impossible to make everyone happy. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5376.24s)]
*  And so you have to be able to take some risks in every in every facet of life. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5379.0s)]
*  Now, you know, because don't you know that, like, you know, the common good, it's like 99.5 percent of people would just laugh at the joke. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5384.4s)]
*  Yes. And then there's that. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5393.28s)]
*  And there's that one person that's had a tough day. Yes, they've had a tough day. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5395.0s)]
*  But we're also starting to raise people to think that just because they've had. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5397.8s)]
*  I'm speaking of that, had a bad day. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5401.639999999999s)]
*  Cane's I'm having. But do you like this or no? [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5403.4s)]
*  I don't have it. I can't. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5406.08s)]
*  I can't have any of it. And I don't really mind. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5407.6s)]
*  I mean, I love birds. And so eating chickens to me seems crazy. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5409.88s)]
*  But if a man eats it, was that deterring from being around that man? [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5413.12s)]
*  I really like a guy to maybe wrap his head around, like understanding because I don't not eat chicken because it's not good. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5416.08s)]
*  That's fucking delicious. Everything you're eating is something that I enjoyed for years of my life. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5421.8s)]
*  And I'm I do miss. Yeah. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5425.72s)]
*  But I don't do things that sometimes that I want to do because it's right. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5427.52s)]
*  Like I don't murder people that I want to murder. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5432.320000000001s)]
*  I don't get my friends. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5434.12s)]
*  I don't hit my mom sometimes when I want to hit her because it's not good for the greater for the world. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5436.2s)]
*  And I don't know. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5441.32s)]
*  Well, you have to be able to eat something at a certain point. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5443.48s)]
*  What's next? And you can't have plant like you're not going to a salad. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5445.64s)]
*  As feeling is so stupid. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5448.5599999999995s)]
*  The what's next? I understand it. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5450.4s)]
*  But like when people go plants have feelings. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5451.68s)]
*  OK, when when that's proven, when plants are like I can see the humanity and plants eyes and I can see I can see a pig. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5454.76s)]
*  And I see my dog in a pig. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5461.92s)]
*  It's not a hard thing to do. Right. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5463.2s)]
*  I understand people can separate fish and squids, even though my octopus teacher should ruin that for everyone. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5464.96s)]
*  They can kind of go, OK, those things are like insects. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5470.72s)]
*  They're lobsters. They're like roaches. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5473.04s)]
*  But when you eat a pig and a chicken, if you've ever had I had a parakeet as a child, as a child, they were the best. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5475.44s)]
*  That are beautiful. They were the best pets I've ever had. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5480.88s)]
*  I loved that bird more than I loved dogs. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5483.5199999999995s)]
*  And I love dogs. But I had more of a connection. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5485.84s)]
*  That bird had more of a personality, was smarter than my dogs. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5487.639999999999s)]
*  I I'm more in Kiwi. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5490.32s)]
*  And then one day I was like, chickens are fucking Kiwi, like Kiwi, that parakeet and chickens, chickens might be even smarter than me. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5491.92s)]
*  I don't know. Yeah, but it doesn't matter if something's dumb, though, because something's dumb doesn't mean it means it should be killed. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5498.64s)]
*  We don't do that to humans. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5503.88s)]
*  But Mother Nature kills us sometimes. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5504.84s)]
*  Sure. And uses us to go back into the earth. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5506.8s)]
*  Go hunt all you want. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5509.12s)]
*  Just don't make animals suffer up until you kill them. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5510.6s)]
*  I don't care. I agree with that. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5512.64s)]
*  Guys, I'm like, fuck, yeah, but it's not the killing. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5514.0s)]
*  Put them out of their goddamn misery, much like the jail thing. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5516.4s)]
*  Let the death penalty is great in a cow's life because the cow's existence up until the death penalty is what I'm bothered by. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5519.12s)]
*  Right. And you can't guarantee that these animals are treated well. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5525.12s)]
*  So many are up until they're slaughtered. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5527.88s)]
*  But because you can't guarantee I just you know, sometimes I look at eggs and I go, I'll buy the most expensive ones. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5529.400000000001s)]
*  Because they're probably the ones that are treated right. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5535.0s)]
*  But it's just a picture of a woman like holding a chicken and you're like, oh, that woman picked these eggs. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5536.4400000000005s)]
*  OK, I'm going to it's like, no, that's the label. Right. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5541.12s)]
*  I don't know unless my sister had chickens and I definitely ate those chickens. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5543.28s)]
*  And look, the thing about it is, man, I think if you I wish we knew here's what I wish. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5548.24s)]
*  I wish we could get inside the brain of a chicken and know if they mind or not. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5553.0s)]
*  They definitely mind. They definitely. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5556.44s)]
*  And of course, they don't. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5559.679999999999s)]
*  I'm just saying I wish we had and I think down the line we will have that ability. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5561.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, we're all going to look so stupid. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5566.12s)]
*  And I'm not saying that I'm perfect and that everyone needs to go vegan. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5568.4s)]
*  But to my mom won't watch the octopus teacher. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5571.32s)]
*  This thing that humanizes octopus is and like not humanizes, but like makes them like you realize like they have emotions in this person. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5574.16s)]
*  Like it really fucks you up, apparently, if you watch this. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5581.16s)]
*  And my mom loves calamari so much that she won't watch it. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5584.04s)]
*  And she goes, I feel like if I watch that, I won't eat it anymore. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5586.28s)]
*  I'm like, then why? [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5588.92s)]
*  So you're living ignorantly so that you can protect yourself because you like fucking. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5590.44s)]
*  But it's always going to be like that. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5595.2s)]
*  But then it's just going to become whoever has owns the media is just going to be able to influence. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5597.04s)]
*  And then they create the product that they want us to buy. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5600.88s)]
*  You know, but like at least those products, hopefully vegans are not doing anything wrong except wanting animals. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5603.5199999999995s)]
*  I have nothing wrong with being happy. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5610.24s)]
*  Yeah. And that's people. People do have a lot. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5612.12s)]
*  I mean, people are skipping this. Oh, really? [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5613.96s)]
*  People hate vegans. I used to hate vegans. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5615.599999999999s)]
*  I used to have like a bit about it in my act. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5617.72s)]
*  And I dated a vegan and I was somebody's a vegan. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5619.5199999999995s)]
*  But don't make me have to be a vegan if you're a vegan. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5623.12s)]
*  No, I'm not making you. I'm just kind of trying to say the same things that when I wasn't a vegan, [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5625.36s)]
*  kind of made me see the other side and actually embrace it and really love it. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5629.88s)]
*  And I'm just sharing with you my experience of realizing that animals want to live just like we do. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5633.24s)]
*  And pigs are terrified from the second they're born. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5639.4800000000005s)]
*  Cows and pigs, most of them, I know not all, get plucked from the mom. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5642.400000000001s)]
*  They're scared the whole time. They're shaking. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5646.360000000001s)]
*  Then they're forced. They never have a single moment of no, it's not because Charles Webb is that's a good experience. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5648.88s)]
*  At least that pig knew some like like warmth. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5655.8s)]
*  These animals never know warmth. A pet never any not one minute of it from the time they're plucked from their mom until they're loaded on trucks. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5658.84s)]
*  They're they're stuck in pens. They're just they're just made to get fat. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5667.32s)]
*  There's no one that's caring about their needs. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5671.08s)]
*  So this animal that is capable of deep, deep feelings like your dog never sees in its however long it lives life. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5672.96s)]
*  It never sees a shroud of kindness to it. And then it's slaughtered. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5680.24s)]
*  How can you how can you do that? [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5683.84s)]
*  Well, shit, I'm not doing it. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5686.12s)]
*  I'm not doing that. I'm having some raisin canes. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5689.0s)]
*  I'm enjoying it. I mean, you can take this out because eat what you want. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5691.48s)]
*  I really I don't care. I'm just saying what I learned that that's why I can't even meet anymore. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5694.8s)]
*  And I fucking hate it because I miss fucking feta cheese. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5699.12s)]
*  I miss so is part of it that you just miss those things and you want to have them and see you're angry at other people. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5701.68s)]
*  I mean, that's the classic hack. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5706.96s)]
*  Fucking I'm asking you. They're angry because they're weak because of protein. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5709.0s)]
*  I didn't say that. I'm angry because I just don't understand why people who love dogs and I know like, [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5714.04s)]
*  you know, dedicate their lives to saving dogs can eat pigs. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5718.48s)]
*  I just don't get it. Can eat pigs that they know have never seen. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5723.12s)]
*  If one minute of what that pig that you're eating is life or that chicken that you're eating life happened to your like, [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5726.76s)]
*  I don't know if you have you don't have a dog. You've never had. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5733.08s)]
*  I don't have a dog. I've considered getting a dog. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5734.92s)]
*  I'm thinking about maybe getting a Welsh terrier or something. Can you bring that up, Nick? [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5736.76s)]
*  Yeah. So if if if for people listening at home, if a minute of the pain that a chicken that you're eating or a pig that you're eating is life. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5740.08s)]
*  And I know it's not your fault. You didn't put them in that situation. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5748.24s)]
*  You're just trying to eat food. I get it. Look at that. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5750.4s)]
*  But if you're if you're a little Welsh terrier that you get someday that you're going to love more than you ever even thought possible, [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5752.32s)]
*  loving a dog, because that's what happens. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5757.36s)]
*  If you had if someone inflicted that kind of life for 30 seconds onto a dog, [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5759.88s)]
*  that a chicken and a pig experience their entire life for 30 seconds, you would want to fucking murder. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5763.92s)]
*  You would you would have that person charged with cruelty. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5769.4s)]
*  They kept them in a box for that dog that it wasn't able to run. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5772.799999999999s)]
*  Its legs were scabbed up. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5777.4s)]
*  It had sores in its eyes. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5779.5599999999995s)]
*  Like the things that happen to these animals, if we had a little bit of it for our precious pets, [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5780.92s)]
*  we would never tolerate it yet when we see when we can't see the footage and we don't want to see it. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5785.719999999999s)]
*  So I just I didn't do it. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5789.719999999999s)]
*  And it's that kind of thing. And by the way, I definitely contribute to horrific injustices to human rights. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5792.16s)]
*  It will never end. At a certain point, we can't just chose one. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5799.12s)]
*  And that's my one. Cool. Yeah. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5802.08s)]
*  Yeah, I think. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5804.16s)]
*  But yeah, I still buy from Amazon, so I just want to be clear. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5806.08s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I'm still part of the problem. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5808.76s)]
*  I mean, it's crazy because like there's also countries where they eat dog and they eat things that are major. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5811.64s)]
*  I kind of like that they do. I like that they go, you know what? [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5817.4s)]
*  We cow. We're going to fucking eat dog. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5820.04s)]
*  I wish we would start eating dog because it would make people wake up to the fact that why isn't this OK? [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5821.599999999999s)]
*  I would have some dog. You should. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5825.88s)]
*  You know what? I honestly I don't want that to happen. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5827.88s)]
*  But I do think that people need to wake the fuck up and realize that when you when we go to China to like, [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5830.64s)]
*  say, don't have this Yulin dog meat festival, how could they eat dogs? [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5836.320000000001s)]
*  But I think there used to be how you would never fucking ever eat a hamburger. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5840.12s)]
*  And I think there used to be times where there was like a connection between animals and humans and nature. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5844.0s)]
*  And so if they took something's life because they needed to survive, then that's what they did. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5850.2s)]
*  The cow lived in a natural environment or if it was it was treated nice and had a good life. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5855.4s)]
*  I've always said we should hunt. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5860.5599999999995s)]
*  I I'm more value when someone hunts with a knife. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5862.4s)]
*  I like when people go, what about when Rogan hunts his elk? [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5865.96s)]
*  I'm like, do it. Those elk lived a good life. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5870.12s)]
*  They just like caught a fucking stray bullet. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5872.92s)]
*  Like things happen. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5875.48s)]
*  But at least they fucking fucked a lot and ate a lot and jumped over creeks and like had some adventures in their life. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5876.599999999999s)]
*  That animals are supposed to. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5882.599999999999s)]
*  So maybe you want more. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5884.08s)]
*  You want animals to have have an out to out. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5885.5199999999995s)]
*  We're bound experience each. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5888.5599999999995s)]
*  We should take these animals and give them a week solution in the wild. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5889.84s)]
*  Yeah. Now, I love that you want YMCA camp for these animals while they grow up before. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5893.76s)]
*  And that's what a lot of like one more thing. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5899.04s)]
*  There's a thing called in the vegan community that I would never do called Bearing Witness. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5902.32s)]
*  And PETA does it a lot where they meet up with these slaughter trucks as they're coming in. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5906.28s)]
*  The pigs are coming to slaughterhouse. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5910.16s)]
*  They're packed into these things and you can just see their snouts through these little cages and they're dying of thirst. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5912.32s)]
*  They're just they're basically dead because if they were dead, who cares? [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5917.84s)]
*  So when pigs are when you if I finish the soda and I was just talking to you, I would just start crinkling the can because I know it's trash going in the trash. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5921.12s)]
*  I'm not saving this. I'm not trying to make this right. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5927.639999999999s)]
*  Right. You're not going to. Yeah. You're not going to give them the best last meal. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5929.48s)]
*  It's not like a prison system. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5932.48s)]
*  Yes. A pig. So it's that's headed to slaughter. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5933.8s)]
*  I'm going to you just treat it like shit. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5937.12s)]
*  So these pigs are in the worst conditions headed to slaughter. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5938.84s)]
*  And these people go and just it's called Bearing Witness because just to see just to honor a pig's life, we go like, I see you. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5941.96s)]
*  And I knew you were an animal that deserved more. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5949.0s)]
*  And I'm really sorry. And just to be there and like they hold they hold a vigil because it's sad and they feed water to these thirsty pigs through the thing. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5951.08s)]
*  And that to me is like I could never do that. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5958.28s)]
*  I can't even look at footage. I just read stuff and know because but that's the kind of thing that I hear. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5961.4800000000005s)]
*  And I just go that's pretty much an out or about experience of like I'm going to show you a pet, the one gentleness you'll get your whole life because you've been kicked and prodded and living in shit and eating bad stuff that doesn't even taste good. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5967.8s)]
*  That's just going to make you fat. I mean, it's just so sad. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5978.280000000001s)]
*  I mean, I think some of it is not people's fault, though. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5981.24s)]
*  Some of it is just the way that society is involved. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5984.16s)]
*  And also, if you have to if you have to feed a family like there was no there's no opportunities for a lot of people to go do all types of certain things. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5987.8s)]
*  That's why I'm saying you don't have to go all vegan. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5996.76s)]
*  Just one if you can do one meal where you eat. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=5998.64s)]
*  Sometimes you don't have a choice like that as a parent that's trying to take care of their kids. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6000.92s)]
*  I get it. But there are plant based options at Burger King now. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6004.84s)]
*  Like there's ways around it that taste good. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6007.96s)]
*  I'm serious. I know that vegan stuff is expensive and I can say that it's elitist of me to be like just go switch to plant based. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6009.64s)]
*  Get meals delivered to your doorstep. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6016.64s)]
*  But there's really affordable options now. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6018.72s)]
*  And that's really old rhetoric of being like it's too expensive. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6021.0s)]
*  There's there's way. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6023.96s)]
*  But I'm just saying some people's lifestyles, it's not an option in their lifestyle. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6025.44s)]
*  I'm not telling if that resonate with you. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6029.16s)]
*  You want to do it, then you can do it. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6031.32s)]
*  All I do is I have to spread the message because it's shit like this that got me to adopt it. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6033.5199999999995s)]
*  And so I know I might sound like a Jehovah's Witness right now. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6037.639999999999s)]
*  And I'm like, I have to spread the Lord's message. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6039.839999999999s)]
*  That's what I feel in my heart for animals is my job. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6041.759999999999s)]
*  And like I said, I am letting severe injustices of human injustices happen and I don't speak up for it because this is just my cause I pick and I'm drawn to it. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6044.36s)]
*  And it works. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6053.32s)]
*  I've made a lot of people go vegan. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6054.84s)]
*  And the only reason I went vegan is because vegans wouldn't shut the fuck up. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6056.24s)]
*  And so I know it works. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6060.16s)]
*  They were annoying as shit. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6061.52s)]
*  And they finally got to me. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6062.96s)]
*  Yeah. So I have to be annoying as shit. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6064.320000000001s)]
*  There's no other way to do it. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6065.64s)]

*  Yeah, I had just finished my tour when COVID started. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6090.16s)]
*  Your first one? Yeah. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6092.56s)]
*  Like your first theater tour of clubs. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6093.68s)]
*  What was it? Was it great? [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6095.52s)]
*  Yeah, it was cool. It was hard. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6096.92s)]
*  I had been already doing clubs like in a row for like a year and a half. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6098.2s)]
*  I was just exhausted. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6101.6s)]
*  By the end, I was exhausted. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6102.64s)]
*  That was what I felt on mine last year. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6104.8s)]
*  It was just doing clubs up until the first theater tour date. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6107.24s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, it's a theater and people are paying more money. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6109.84s)]
*  The pressure's on. And I did cool stuff. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6112.32s)]
*  Like I finished with a dance. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6114.24s)]
*  Andrew, Colin, my co-host on Nikki Glaser podcast and my best friend and roommate. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6115.36s)]
*  And then my other best friend, Anya Marina, like she opened with music. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6119.88s)]
*  Like I had a band open and I brought my friends on the road. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6123.24s)]
*  It was so fun. And then COVID happened and it all shut down. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6125.639999999999s)]
*  Right. And then so we're starting it back up. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6127.639999999999s)]
*  And I in COVID, I've learned how to play guitar. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6129.88s)]
*  I might like I'm going to sing a song with my friend, Anya. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6132.599999999999s)]
*  And like I might do like private concerts before my shows, [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6135.04s)]
*  like at cafes in town where I just do Taylor Swift, like singalongs. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6138.759999999999s)]
*  And I'm not even joking you, like it's I'm bad at guitar, [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6142.04s)]
*  but I like singing Taylor Swift with other Swifties fans. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6144.32s)]
*  So I might start doing that. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6147.84s)]
*  But like the show itself and my dad and I sang over the summer. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6149.28s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I remember seeing that version of Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper's [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6152.44s)]
*  that, you know, shallow. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6157.68s)]
*  But we rewrote it about me living at home with my parents. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6159.32s)]
*  And it was really fucking funny. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6161.6s)]
*  It was all about, you know, I've got to leave. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6163.0s)]
*  I've got to go. And like hearing my parents fuck through the wall. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6164.96s)]
*  But it was like and it sounds like a dumb. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6167.56s)]
*  It was really good. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6170.0s)]
*  And I went to I went to voice lessons and like learned how to sing like Gaga. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6170.76s)]
*  And it was fucking singing is fucking funny. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6174.08s)]
*  My dad's an amazing musician. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6177.0s)]
*  So are you a good singer or not? [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6178.56s)]
*  I can be, but I quit singing lessons and I smoke a lot of pot now. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6180.0s)]
*  But apparently my singing teachers like you can do whatever. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6183.6s)]
*  I'll work with it like rock and roll artists smoke. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6185.84s)]

*  And now I'm just like, if this guy is someone I'm going to marry. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6428.0s)]

*  Hold this bottle because I have La Croix cans in the passenger seat. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6433.52s)]
*  Maybe that's so funny. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6437.72s)]
*  Yeah, I could relate to a lot of that here anymore. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6438.6s)]
*  How the reflection of this your environment. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6440.6s)]
*  I don't want to present any way I'm not, because if you get to be [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6442.64s)]
*  authentic across the board and really are like, I am who I am and that's OK, [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6445.76s)]
*  then you don't have to ever think I literally don't have to. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6449.72s)]
*  Because the thing I realized is about comedy and you tap into it big time, [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6453.36s)]
*  because this is the thing I notice about you is you just talk and it's funny. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6456.56s)]
*  Like, I know you're aware of what you say is funny, [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6459.6s)]
*  but you talk in a way that you almost act like you don't know. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6462.88s)]
*  But I also think that you can't. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6465.56s)]
*  You're in a position now that you know that your fans get you [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6467.52s)]
*  and you know that you're funny, that you can show up and you don't really have to prepare. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6471.080000000001s)]
*  You can just start talking and it's going to be good enough. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6474.88s)]
*  Like maybe prepare a little bit. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6477.72s)]
*  But I could get on stage and talk about fucking anything and be entertaining [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6479.0s)]
*  at this point, because I've done it that long. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6481.92s)]
*  And within that is like this freedom to be people are at ease. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6483.88s)]
*  Audiences want to watch you comfortable. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6489.400000000001s)]
*  If I'm comfortable and not worried about what you think, they [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6490.76s)]
*  up it up because. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6494.52s)]
*  And we feel good then, too. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6495.92s)]
*  I notice if I'm having fun, man, if I'm in a good place and you have the shows, [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6497.12s)]
*  you see, and being honest, if I'm not in a good place, I'll just be like, man, [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6500.72s)]
*  I am fucking depressed today. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6503.64s)]
*  Or if I'm too sometimes I go on stage, I'm too high. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6505.64s)]
*  My new thing is I'm just going to be like, guys, I'm really high [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6507.96s)]
*  because the audience just wants in. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6510.04s)]
*  They want in on what's going. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6511.8s)]
*  They sent something weird. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6512.96s)]
*  What is it? Oh, she's high. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6513.88s)]
*  Yeah, the wheat I took one. [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6515.56s)]
*  I thought I wanted one hit. I took two. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6517.52s)]
*  I got greedy. Now we're in a weird place. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6519.28s)]
*  Now I've broken this weirdness that I in my head go, Nick, [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6521.24s)]
*  you shouldn't have smoked weed before the set. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6524.68s)]
*  You're such a bad comedian. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6526.24s)]
*  Now, what's your next joke? What's the next joke? [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6527.32s)]
*  You shouldn't have done that. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6529.28s)]
*  And now I just go, I'm high, everyone. [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6530.36s)]
*  And now it's like, OK, no more secrets. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6531.8s)]
*  I'm like, let's just be honest. Yeah. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6534.12s)]
*  And I think that's what comedy is, just being honest. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6537.0s)]
*  Let's be honest. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6539.12s)]
*  And so as long as you just talk honestly, it's going to be funny. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6539.88s)]
*  And good. And people are going to like it. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j43tZJMneR0&t=6542.88s)]
