*  You got an elevator nearby. That's annoying. I have a fucking elevator in my like house. Well it's like on the outside of it [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=146.76s)]
*  Dang, rich check. Wow bro, what do you mean you have a real elevator? And what do you have people like waiting? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=155.76s)]
*  Well no, there's just an elevator that's like, it's like in my building. But it's basically my elevator basically [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=162.76s)]
*  Like so say if you get in it and the door's open, where are you? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=169.76s)]
*  I'm right, I'm at my door. But are you in your apartment, in your condo or home or are you at? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=173.76s)]
*  No, I'm like a doorway. But it's not a lobby, it's like a private, it's like right there [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=181.76s)]
*  Like it's like a shared, it's like me and the others. I'm in Malibu in this condo so it's a vibe so you go all the way down [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=186.76s)]
*  But wait, what I was gonna say was I'm really happy to be here. Thanks man. Seriously, you're like TikTok Ellen [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=193.76s)]
*  Oh dang. It's a big deal to be here. That's cool, I didn't know that. I mean we have a similar haircut or at some point we did [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=199.76s)]
*  And we're both from Louisiana, which is kind of crazy. You probably wouldn't think that Ellen's from Louisiana, huh? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=206.76s)]
*  I didn't know that you were both from, I didn't know she was from there. Yeah, I think she grew up there. Can you look that up, Zach? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=212.76s)]
*  Huh? Ellen. Ellen DeGeneres. Yo, Ellen DeGeneres is, that was my big thing. I always wanted to be on Ellen [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=217.76s)]
*  Because I watched Ellen since I was a little boy. And then I was like, yo, if you make it on Ellen, like you made it [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=226.76s)]
*  And then I actually went to Ellen and performed. I met Kobe. He was there when you went on? Dude, yeah, Kobe was there. Let's see, what does it say? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=230.76s)]
*  Metairie, Louisiana? Wow, Louisiana, that's crazy. Wow, Metairie's kind of, Metairie's a good place to, like if you want to do drugs with somebody that's Italian at night [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=239.76s)]
*  Okay. Well, speaking of drugs. That's a good place. She was originally supposed to be the chick in Pulp Fiction, not Uma Thurman [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=254.76s)]
*  Not Uma Thurman's character. But do you remember when they were stabbing her in the heart to give her the adrenaline, the shot of adrenaline? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=265.76s)]
*  And the chick's house when John Travolta's like, who's that girl with all that shit on her face? And he's like, that's my wife. Ellen was supposed to play the chick with all the shit on her face. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=272.76s)]
*  Oh, really? Yeah, fun fucking fact. Oh, there it is. That would have been Ellen DeGeneres. That would have been Ellen? Yeah. Oh, dang. Yeah, but that was a highlight for me. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=281.76s)]
*  You went there. What do you mean? You went to Ellen. Yeah, I went there. Well, I went twice actually. Damn. Yeah, and then we became like homies. And then next thing I know, I'm like, us and our wives are like at her restaurant and fucking Leonardo DiCaprio comes up. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=291.76s)]
*  He's like, oh, what's up, Logic? Blah, blah, blah. I'm like, what the fuck is going on? What's my life? I felt like somehow I was like, joining the Illuminati. Yeah, it was wild. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=306.76s)]
*  Yeah, it must sort of feel like as you get more popular that you start to meet certain people and you're like, damn, am I getting closer to like meeting like the final like lizard boss or whatever? Yeah, I guess. You know? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=314.76s)]
*  Bro, it's insane. I'm actually because I'm going ham on social media now. Like I'm like taking it so seriously, spending really good money on, you know, my team, my camera guys, my editing. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=326.76s)]
*  Like I have in-house editors and I have two houses that I'm paying because I have so much shit that's coming because I realize editor trafficking. It sounds like I'm editor trafficking. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=336.76s)]
*  Yeah, but it's all good. And no, but I really believe in like this next chapter of my career where I'm just going to be making music and having a blast. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=345.76s)]
*  But like I feel that my personality is really what makes me me. And it's what makes logic logic, you know, the biracial guy, like just being myself. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=352.76s)]
*  And I'm about to lean into that shit hard as fuck. So, but what was I saying about Ellen? Well, it's interesting. I think like as I watch you, I think like first, obviously people get to know you through your music, right? Yeah, for sure. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=361.76s)]
*  A lot of people have. But I also then I also find and I found this. I haven't found this about a lot of musicians and a lot of musicians kind of aren't interesting. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=373.76s)]
*  They're interesting through their music, but they aren't. I found a lot of musicians are tough to interview because. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=382.76s)]
*  It's the personification. They're trying to portray like who they are on the record rather than allowing themselves to just be them. You know what I mean? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=390.76s)]
*  It's like Mariah Carey takes shits. You know what I mean? But maybe she doesn't want to talk about that on the. You know what I mean? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=397.76s)]
*  Like I got I got to use wet wipes. What about you? I'm still I'm still afraid to admit which way I wipe. What you mean? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=402.76s)]
*  You'd be wiping towards the ball. I mean, I don't know. Are you fucking serious? What? That's crazy. You what? You wipe towards your balls? I don't think so. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=409.76s)]
*  Anyway, man, so I use I use I use wet wipes. I don't know. I mean, they should have people like kind of like that should be something you have to like instead of like your gender, like say which way you wipe. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=418.76s)]
*  Like that way people can just assume your gender right there. I get it. I guess. I don't know. But I've never heard about. I've never heard of a man wiping towards his balls. Yeah, that's insane. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=431.76s)]
*  I mean, that'd be who would do it. You know, nobody I know. Anyway, question. I have a question for you is, first of all, are you cool talking about like fam? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=440.76s)]
*  Nothing weird. I'm just saying like family. Like if I asked you about family and stuff. Yeah. OK, cool. Because I don't know. You never know. Yeah, totally. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=449.76s)]
*  So your dad, when he has you, was 70 years old. Yeah, bro, because I was looking shit up because like I've seen, you know, cool stand up fun stuff like that. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=454.76s)]
*  But I like before I came to the show, I was like, man, I really want to know even more about this this guy. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=464.76s)]
*  So that means that your father was born like over 110 years ago. Yeah, let me think. I was just so funny. Yes. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=469.76s)]
*  I was just thinking about him the other day and I was thinking about how how old he would be if he was alive. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=476.76s)]
*  He would be he was born in 1910. So he would be 113 this year. Wow. That's it'd be crazy. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=483.76s)]
*  My grandfather was born in 1880. But to be busting nuts at 70. Oh, I don't want to do it. That's wild because your heart could stop. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=492.76s)]
*  Well, that reminds me of my dad. Like every time you're like getting close, it's just a risk, man. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=502.76s)]
*  How old was your dad? And thank you for asking, man. It's sweet to you that you that you checked out and you care. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=508.76s)]
*  It's nice to think about my dad. I was thinking the other day how it would be cool if they had a place where you could take clothing from like a deceased parent and put it on a mannequin and go spend time with your family. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=513.76s)]
*  In a weird way. That's funny. Like if people need that kind of healing in their lives or something. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=521.76s)]
*  I know you had kind of a wild upbringing. So you started out in Maryland, right? Yes, sir. OK, just for our audience that doesn't know because some of our audience might not know you and I want them to get to know you. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=526.76s)]
*  And so you started out in Maryland and and your parents are both your parents are different colors, right? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=534.76s)]
*  Yeah, my dad's black and my mom is white. And I was conceived in a crack house after they had met each other after about three days. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=540.76s)]
*  Yep. And then they're a bender baby, bender baby. Yeah. My mom was a prostitute. My dad was a crack for a long time. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=548.76s)]
*  I'm named after my dad. And yeah, what's really crazy, though, is I remember my dad telling me he was like, yeah, you know, I got a paternity test. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=557.76s)]
*  Make sure your ass was mine because I came out looking white as fuck. Yeah, because it's very apparent my father is a black man. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=566.76s)]
*  Like he's not half black, isn't it? He's fucking black. And I thought he did it like when I came out the canal. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=573.76s)]
*  But the literally, bro, like three days ago, a buddy of mine was at my crib and he's like, oh, fuck, I got a warrant. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=580.76s)]
*  I'm like, what do you mean you got a warrant? And he's like, I got a warrant in Maryland. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=586.76s)]
*  And I'm like, bro, when's the last time you were there? He's like 10 years ago. I'm like, oh, shit, what do you got to do? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=590.76s)]
*  So he has to write the judge. Long story short, he was looking up his criminal history on this website. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=594.76s)]
*  And he's like, yeah, you can type in anybody's name. And I'm like, yo, type in my fucking dad. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=600.76s)]
*  So he types in my dad. My dad's like, bro, he like stole my identity and maxed out credit cards before I was 18 and shit because we have the same name. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=605.76s)]
*  And so I'm like, let's look it up. So we look it up and I'm just seeing like petty theft, car theft, possession charges. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=614.76s)]
*  And then I see Terry Lee Miller, my mother's maiden name versus Robert Hall defendant. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=625.76s)]
*  And I'm like, what the fuck is this? And it says paternity slash child support, bro. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=631.76s)]
*  It's like 1999. So I'm nine years old. Right. And I look this. It's so crazy. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=636.76s)]
*  Like, bro, I never knew. Like, you know, I heard about it. I kind of saw things when I was a kid, but you don't really put too much together. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=641.76s)]
*  Yeah. And then you see on the Internet, you're kind of see it's something you're wandering through yourself. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=648.76s)]
*  It's like I'm reading. I already wrote a biography. You know what I mean? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=652.76s)]
*  I wrote I wrote an autobiography, so now I'm reading something that's even crazier. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=655.76s)]
*  And so what's hilarious is that it shows like that my dad took a paternity test because he was like, that ain't my baby. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=659.76s)]
*  Nine years later, it's nine years. Wonder what you did something at eight years old that he's like, no, yeah. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=666.76s)]
*  But the best part is. Fuck the Internet. I'm black. I told you. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=672.76s)]
*  Dude, yeah, I think these day. Yeah, being black definitely helps. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=677.76s)]
*  I think everything's kind of heading towards that kind of Ben Simmons kind of trans sort of vibe where everybody's going to be. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=680.76s)]
*  I think a lot of people. That's what I said. We've always said like beige power, like in three generations, you can't you're going to need it. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=687.76s)]
*  Even now, you need like a chart to be racist. I feel like you need like a you know, I'm saying you need to like carry the one if you're really going to get into it. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=694.76s)]
*  You can't even yell. You used to just be racist. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=701.76s)]
*  I feel like you need to like carry the one if you're really going to get into it. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=703.76s)]
*  You can't even yell. You used to just be a little yell like or something out of the window and it would land on somebody. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=706.76s)]
*  But now it's like everybody's. Yeah, exactly. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=712.76s)]
*  But yeah, crazy. That's crazy, man. Did it make you feel like he didn't care or something at that point? [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=715.76s)]
*  Because that would be I feel like if I saw that or did your mom like instigated and so that's why he had to do it. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=720.76s)]
*  No, I think well, I definitely think she wanted child support. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=726.76s)]
*  I'm just like woman. What you gonna get from a crackhead like I'm just being real, right? [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=729.76s)]
*  I love my dad. He's clean nowadays. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=733.76s)]
*  I actually I haven't talked to him in a couple of years and I just texted him the other day. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=735.76s)]
*  And so I'm always trying. It's like a fucking black hole. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=738.76s)]
*  No pun intended that I'm always trying to go through. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=742.76s)]
*  It's just whatever. Anyway, I'm like woman. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=745.76s)]
*  Why would you even try to get child support when the man can't take care of himself at the time? [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=748.76s)]
*  So I'm like it just to me it doesn't make sense. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=753.76s)]
*  But now your dad has my dad on age nut busting. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=756.76s)]
*  But my dad was 63. This is what's really crazy. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=760.76s)]
*  So I'm one of nine. Wow. But I'm the only child between my mother and my father. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=762.76s)]
*  So my mother has all our all her children are with black men and all my brothers and sisters on my dad's side. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=767.76s)]
*  They're all so everybody's mixed. But I'm the whitest looking mother. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=775.76s)]
*  I'm the most transparent. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=778.76s)]
*  And what's crazy is is 33 years ago after I was born, my dad got a vasectomy. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=780.76s)]
*  OK. And then five years ago, I find out that I have a little brother. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=788.76s)]
*  No. So the story is a wild one. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=792.76s)]
*  Now, so he was already chopped out and then he got a new baby somehow. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=796.76s)]
*  Yes, I should just poke through. And it's his because you know, they made him get a paternity. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=800.76s)]
*  So what's probably says a stack of pizza. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=806.76s)]
*  It was wild, though, about my dad is that who I love. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=809.76s)]
*  I'm just keeping it real. You know, I always find really funny is like sometimes my family be like, we don't want our business out there. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=813.76s)]
*  And I'm like, well, you shouldn't have done all that dumb ass shit. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=819.76s)]
*  What the fuck do you mean? But anyway, I would never say anything too crazy. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=822.76s)]
*  But this is all public fucking knowledge. So you know, exactly. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=826.76s)]
*  Exactly. So my dad, I find out I have a little brother, like 2018. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=829.76s)]
*  And I read about this in my book because I actually wanted to adopt my brother. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=835.76s)]
*  But that's another story. So I had a stepmother. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=839.76s)]
*  Her name was Debbie and Debbie and my dad would use together. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=842.76s)]
*  And Debbie. Oh, did and wound up in a coma for four months. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=846.76s)]
*  So she's in a coma. Beautiful woman. She's in a coma. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=854.76s)]
*  My dad is like, all right, well, this sucks. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=857.76s)]
*  He's in the program AA and he goes up to one of his friends and they're talking to that. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=860.76s)]
*  They find out that a close friend of his is dying. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=865.76s)]
*  I think it was like cancer or something. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=869.76s)]
*  So he goes to see her and like her last words are like, take care of my daughter. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=871.76s)]
*  And her daughter was like this young 21 year old girl. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=875.76s)]
*  He took care of her. He fucked her and knocked her up. No. Yeah. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=878.76s)]
*  Oh, she is so a. Everyone's fucking each other. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=881.76s)]
*  Anyway, knocks her up. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=885.76s)]
*  Shortly after the baby's born, she dies of a heroin overdose. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=888.76s)]
*  No. Then. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=891.76s)]
*  And now this had happened a bit before. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=894.76s)]
*  But while all this was happening, my dad had started seeing a woman who I think is now his current wife. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=895.76s)]
*  And then his then wife comes out of the coma and he's like, it's over. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=903.76s)]
*  It's like, you know, that's so crazy. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=910.76s)]
*  Well, sometimes women take a long time to make to decide. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=912.76s)]
*  Yeah, but it's like, wow, she can't. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=914.76s)]
*  I know. And then unfortunately, she OD and died a couple of years later. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=919.76s)]
*  But this is like the life I grew up in, man. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=924.76s)]
*  Just drugs and violence and guns and my brothers running in the streets and you have surprise siblings. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=926.76s)]
*  It's like surprise siblings, bro. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=930.76s)]
*  Like 11 years old, I found out I had four siblings. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=932.76s)]
*  I was like, what? [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=934.76s)]
*  It seems like so like such a chaotic environment to grow up in. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=936.76s)]
*  Were there times were there like some special times you remember like spending with your mom or dad that was just kind of like you and them one on one that were like that was kind of like a warm, like human kind of time? [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=939.76s)]
*  Yeah, I remember this one time my dad stole my earring and pawn it for crack. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=950.76s)]
*  That was dope. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=953.76s)]
*  Damn. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=954.76s)]
*  It was just one earring, too. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=956.76s)]
*  It was just one earring. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=957.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=958.76s)]
*  No, I guess. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=959.76s)]
*  I guess a few times I had with my dad was music because he's a musician. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=961.76s)]
*  So he plays like go go music, which is prominent in D.C. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=965.76s)]
*  And he played with EU and Chuck Brown and different people. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=968.76s)]
*  And I think that's where I get a lot of my musical talent. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=971.76s)]
*  But he's the type of motherfucker though. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=973.76s)]
*  He would take me to the studio. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=975.76s)]
*  And if there was like studio time that he schemed, like I would get none of it. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=976.76s)]
*  Like he'd be like in there singing like, you know, he's got some he's got some songs. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=981.76s)]
*  One of his most famous lines is, she's just a crackhead bitch sucking on the devil's ding dong. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=984.76s)]
*  And he's talking about smoking a pipe. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=990.76s)]
*  I'm like, I feel like that's copyrighted. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=992.76s)]
*  I've heard that every crackhead plays that straight up. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=994.76s)]
*  That is like a national anthem. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=998.76s)]
*  My mom, my mom, we there was definitely for as sick mentally as my mother was and is. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1000.76s)]
*  I haven't talked to her in over a decade now, unfortunately. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1009.76s)]
*  And I'd love to. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1012.76s)]
*  But she's just not there. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1013.76s)]
*  She's the type of person to be like, don't take the Lord's name in vain. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1015.76s)]
*  God damn it. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1018.76s)]
*  You motherfucker. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1019.76s)]
*  Like crazy. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1020.76s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1021.76s)]
*  And she was she would she hit me with the hard R and all my my brothers and sisters growing up. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1022.76s)]
*  It's weird. It was like, really? [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1027.76s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1028.76s)]
*  Your mom would embalm you. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1029.76s)]
*  Yeah, bro. It was like this systemic because she's you know, I remember her telling me that she brought, you know, 14 year old black boy home to introduce to her parents. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1030.76s)]
*  And they were like, we don't mix with their kind here. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1038.76s)]
*  Like, wow, shit. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1039.76s)]
*  Right. It was like old school racism. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1040.76s)]
*  Yeah. So it was in her because she would always obviously she's fucking black guys. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1042.76s)]

*  They'd be like, could you please write this mathematical equation? [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1104.76s)]
*  And I'm like, I'm fucking doing math exact Galifianakis to decrease my boner before you stand up. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1107.76s)]
*  But yeah, I think well, for me, I think there was no like I had such a like a rocky connection with my own mother. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1112.76s)]
*  Like she didn't show me like a lot of and I say this a lot, but I don't really go into it. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1118.76s)]
*  She like didn't show me like a lot of affection and she like would kind of look at me with judgment all the time. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1122.76s)]
*  And so I never knew any time I got around a woman, it was always like a lot of like real like uncomfortable energy. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1129.76s)]
*  Was this even when you were like a child? [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1138.76s)]
*  Did you feel this way or was it more in your teenage in later years? [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1140.76s)]
*  I didn't notice it until I got a little bit. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1143.76s)]
*  Now I notice it all. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1145.76s)]
*  It all makes a lot of sense. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1146.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1147.76s)]
*  But yeah, I think my mother would just always had a lot of she never looked at me like just with like adoration. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1148.76s)]
*  There was always like judgment. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1152.76s)]
*  And so I think I always interpreted that like with a woman that there's always some type of judgment. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1155.76s)]
*  So I'm not enough immediately when I show up or even look at a woman. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1160.76s)]
*  It's like even when I look at a woman's eyes, it was like I'm not enough. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1165.76s)]
*  So I think that like permeated in me throughout like being young. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1168.76s)]
*  And so I think it made everything kind of so then any time I got close to a woman, everything was uncomfortable because it was like, how can I be this close and I'm OK? [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1171.76s)]
*  I'm OK to be here and it's not like I'm not being like rich feeling rejected. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1180.76s)]
*  It's like I think it made it made everything super just a lot of nerves in that space. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1185.76s)]
*  You know, I get it. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1191.76s)]
*  I've always felt more of a connection with women because I was raised and surrounded by women. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1192.76s)]
*  So I've had to deal with like, you know, I've had sisters who fucking come home after getting raped or you know what I mean? [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1197.76s)]
*  Just like the craziest shit. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1202.76s)]
*  And I don't know. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1204.76s)]
*  I just always like, you know, I see my mom. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1205.76s)]
*  I'm like a little boy, you know, like damn me or a toddler. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1208.76s)]
*  She's getting her fucking brains beat out of her. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1211.76s)]
*  She's all bloody and police come and all the shit. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1213.76s)]
*  And I'm like, oh, don't treat a woman like that. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1215.76s)]
*  You know, my dad's smoking crack and punting my fucking PlayStation and shit. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1218.76s)]
*  Oh, don't treat your child like that. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1221.76s)]
*  So I saw all these, you know, my brothers running around with guns. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1223.76s)]
*  Oh, try to don't do these things. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1225.76s)]
*  And that's not me shitting on my family. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1227.76s)]
*  Like, it's just right. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1229.76s)]
*  It is what it is. You know what I mean? [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1230.76s)]
*  And a lot of my family's really turned their lives around for the most. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1231.76s)]
*  I mean, my mother is still in the hood and shit, but it's good. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1235.76s)]
*  And, you know, sometimes motherfuckers will be like, hey, man, like, how come you don't give your money, your family money? [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1237.76s)]
*  And it's like, one, I have and then it's gone immediately. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1242.76s)]
*  It's like, I've done that. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1246.76s)]
*  And then it's like, oh, I learned my lesson immediately because like you get somebody money. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1247.76s)]
*  They don't know what to do with it. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1251.76s)]
*  It's even like, OK, well, I'm going to buy you a house and what I got to pay your mortgage for the rest of your life. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1252.76s)]
*  I got this, I got that. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1256.76s)]
*  So it's like you can only give but so much to a person because if somebody gave me a million dollars when I was in the hood at 18, I would just be a Taco Bell every day. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1257.76s)]
*  Oh, I would just be like, I don't know. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1266.76s)]
*  I'd be doing coke, dude. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1269.76s)]
*  I'd be trying to eat my own ass. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1270.76s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1272.76s)]

*  But it's interesting you say that because yeah, there's some family members of mine that like, [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1426.76s)]
*  it's easier to share stuff with or like help them get something if they're trying to get it in their life and I can help financially. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1429.76s)]
*  And then there's some where it's like, they're not in a space where they're kind of healthy enough in a way where it's like, [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1436.76s)]
*  yeah, you can't, it's tough to, if you give $10,000 to somebody who's struggling with addiction, you might never, they may die. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1442.76s)]
*  No, you can't do it. Yeah. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1449.76s)]
*  So some of that stuff gets a little bit tricky. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1450.76s)]
*  My niece, my niece, I'm putting her through college right now. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1452.76s)]
*  She's one of the ones that like really broke through and she's doing incredible. Sorry, what were you going to say? [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1455.76s)]
*  Yeah. So, but how are you able to like compartmentalize that stuff and like not get so attached to it? [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1459.76s)]
*  Because it seems like you're able to like talk about these pretty traumatic times that happen in your life and you don't, [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1464.76s)]
*  but you're able to kind of discuss it in a way that's like, I'm not like who fuck like, yeah, I think you go through that or you never really, that never really was. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1471.76s)]
*  I definitely did, but I was never like, I mean, I've had, there's, you know, I've shed some tears over like not having a family. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1479.76s)]
*  You know what I mean? Things like that. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1486.76s)]
*  But most of the tears I shed were like having my son and like getting married to a beautiful woman that loves me and like giving me the family I never had. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1488.76s)]
*  And that shit makes me be like, wow. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1498.76s)]
*  Like I'll look at my son like this cute little three year old pure soul and I'm like, damn, I can't believe my parents smacked me around and did, you know, cook crack in front of me. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1499.76s)]
*  You know, I had drug dealers in the house cooking crack. I'm breathing this shit in. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1511.76s)]
*  I could never imagine that for my son. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1514.76s)]
*  So it makes me really happy. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1517.76s)]
*  But I think the biggest way, if I'm being quite honest, how I dealt with my upbringing was through music, through writing. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1519.76s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1525.76s)]
*  Because like a lot of people are scared of therapy or this or that. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1526.76s)]
*  I've always been, I've been in therapy for 10 years, over 10 years now, and it's helped me a lot. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1529.76s)]
*  And it's given me a lot of tools to break down and better know myself. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1534.76s)]
*  But before I sat down with any professional, I had to really look in the mirror and be like, yo, like what matters to you? [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1538.76s)]
*  You know what I mean? What do you want? [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1544.76s)]
*  What don't you want? [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1546.76s)]
*  And that's why even with the raps and shit like I didn't look at it at hip hop and go, oh, yeah, I'm a boats and hoes and bitches. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1547.76s)]
*  And I didn't like I didn't see it like that. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1554.76s)]
*  I saw it as a business. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1556.76s)]
*  And I say with persistence, determination, realism and wanting success more than your next breath, you could truly fucking attain anything you want. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1557.76s)]
*  But a big key is realism. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1563.76s)]
*  So I wasn't like, oh, I want the twenty thousand dollar chain and I want the I was like, I want to create a brand and I want to do it in a way that nobody else is really doing it. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1565.76s)]
*  And that's why my whole motto is peace, love, positivity. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1574.76s)]
*  It's about being yourself. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1576.76s)]
*  And also, the craziest shit is, bro, Eminem is Eminem the goat. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1577.76s)]
*  He's the shit. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1581.76s)]
*  But he's not the first white rapper. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1582.76s)]
*  There's so many before. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1584.76s)]
*  But I'm the first black, white, white looking black guy traversing hip hop like me and J. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1586.76s)]
*  J. Cole's genetic makeup. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1593.76s)]
*  The same Drake's the same. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1595.76s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1596.76s)]
*  So many people. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1597.76s)]
*  So I'm like the first of my kind as well experiencing this. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1598.76s)]
*  So when I would be talking about things like emotions and how it's OK to feel this and people are like, shut the fuck up. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1602.76s)]
*  Like and I had to like really navigate being comfortable in my skin. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1608.76s)]
*  And yeah, because I feel like that's not a universe where if you come with feelings in like a rap battle, it's a yeah, you know, that's not the sword and shield you want to bring in there. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1613.76s)]
*  It's changing a little bit, though. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1624.76s)]
*  When you see like a lot of these like a lot of like these like ciphers and verses and stuff you see online, I feel like you start to people get a little bit more emo in there. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1625.76s)]
*  I guess I don't really give a fuck about that shit. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1634.76s)]
*  I'm just like I love music. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1636.76s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1638.76s)]
*  Like I used to be about the freestyle and all that shit and like the battles and that's it's cool. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1639.76s)]
*  It's cool. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1643.76s)]
*  But it's a lot of it's a lot of fuck you. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1644.76s)]
*  I'm great. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1646.76s)]
*  And all this, which is systemic. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1647.76s)]
*  I still rap like that sometimes. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1649.76s)]
*  Like I'll have braggadocious shit. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1650.76s)]
*  Like I actually had a line where I said braggadocious flow on vain like an IV. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1652.76s)]
*  So it's like it's just like little things where it's in us. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1656.76s)]
*  It's systemic. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1659.76s)]
*  Why am I wearing this? [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1660.76s)]
*  I'm wearing this because I never had it. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1661.76s)]
*  My people never had it. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1663.76s)]
*  So I like it. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1664.76s)]
*  I got it. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1665.76s)]
*  What's up? [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1666.76s)]
*  Look at me in a way. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1667.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1668.76s)]
*  It really is like you know what I mean? [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1669.76s)]
*  I like to think I do it a little more, you know, classic. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1670.76s)]
*  I'm not trying to try not to be too over the top. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1673.76s)]
*  But if a motherfucker wants to be over the top, good. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1675.76s)]
*  He never had it. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1677.76s)]
*  And if that's what he wants to do. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1678.76s)]
*  But I would rather sleep in my money. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1679.76s)]
*  You know, I'd rather sleep in a five million dollar house in Malibu. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1683.76s)]
*  I'd rather have you a nice home or something. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1686.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1688.76s)]
*  A waffle maker gets you a damn Ottoman dude. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1689.76s)]
*  I remember when I got a fucking Ottoman cuz damn bro. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1692.76s)]
*  The game it does do when I sat on the couch and then my feet sat on a couch. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1695.76s)]
*  Touchdown dude. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1700.76s)]
*  I thought I was going to damn heaven bro. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1702.76s)]
*  It's pretty amazing. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1704.76s)]
*  I would have taken my own life right there if I could have. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1705.76s)]
*  Just to stay comfortable forever. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1708.76s)]
*  I got a number you could call. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1709.76s)]
*  I know dude. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1711.76s)]
*  I heard about that man. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1712.76s)]
*  Sorry our conversation has been all over a little bit. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1714.76s)]
*  But it's cool bro. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1716.76s)]
*  I'm trying to. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1717.76s)]
*  I like it. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1718.76s)]
*  It feels like we're just like I'm just chilling with a friend. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1719.76s)]
*  So speaking of which you went to like five fucking colleges. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1722.76s)]
*  What's up with that? [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1724.76s)]
*  Yeah man. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1725.76s)]
*  I think I didn't know what I wanted to do. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1726.76s)]
*  And I got into comedy and it like comedy was this kind of thing. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1728.76s)]
*  You didn't have to commit to anything. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1732.76s)]
*  I always had a lot of trouble committing to stuff. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1734.76s)]
*  And so comedy kind of made it where you didn't have to commit. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1738.76s)]
*  I think I didn't want to commit to a college. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1741.76s)]
*  I just I don't know. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1743.76s)]
*  I had big like commitment issues. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1745.76s)]
*  I think out of the gate in the world I didn't like kind of my environment so much that I just didn't. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1747.76s)]
*  I was never going to let anything kind of place me or pigeonhole me. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1751.76s)]
*  Or even if it was a school. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1757.76s)]
*  It was like I want to do my own thing. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1760.76s)]
*  I think that's dope. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1764.76s)]
*  I mean I feel like also if I personally I feel that your 20s like to like 26 27. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1766.76s)]
*  That's the time to just fuck your life up if you're going to do it like following a dream. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1773.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1777.76s)]
*  Like let it go because by the time you're 26 27 you're like all right fuck it. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1778.76s)]
*  I'll put this tie on and go to this job for the rest of my life. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1780.76s)]
*  Chase Bank or whatever. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1783.76s)]
*  But it's like I feel like enterprise rental to whatever you're going to do. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1785.76s)]
*  Whatever your ambition is do it now. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1788.76s)]
*  Do it right now while you still can because you don't want to look back you know. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1791.76s)]
*  I say that a lot to you. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1796.76s)]
*  You could even and I know this is maybe look frowned upon or whatever you could kill somebody. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1798.76s)]
*  A lot of people are doing I would say that's frowned upon. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1804.76s)]
*  Well a lot of people are doing seven years now. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1806.76s)]
*  Oh for a murder. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1808.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1809.76s)]
*  So I'm like dude if there's somebody that we really don't need I mean ask some other people don't just fucking pick somebody in your area. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1810.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1815.76s)]
*  But you know get a small consensus and look dog if you think it's going to help humanity bro you only you know people are doing seven years. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1816.76s)]
*  Wait a second. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1823.76s)]
*  How did we just go from following your dreams to murdering people and only getting seven years. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1824.76s)]
*  It's rap music dude. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1829.76s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1830.76s)]
*  Well actually one thing I did want to also ask because we were talking about emotions and shit. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1831.76s)]
*  So as a as a comic you know as a fucking genius comedian which you are you know you're so quick you're witty you're on your shit. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1835.76s)]
*  Has there ever been a time where you were like going back and forth with another comedian and they actually and this is it's not a two part question but more of a description and they actually like fucking like legitimately hurt your feelings or is it more so like fuck I've been bested in this comedic duel or both. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1843.76s)]
*  That's a good question man. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1864.76s)]
*  I think I've been bested in a comedic duel for sure about like guys like you know I'll be I'll get around like Shane Gillis sometimes and just who he is makes me laugh or if I'm having like a rough day. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1865.76s)]
*  Fuck one day I've been eating I went on a new diet or you need any calories or something for like a week. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1878.76s)]
*  So I could barely even breathe you know like I couldn't even open my eyes that good and I had to do an episode with this kid Bryce Mitchell right. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1883.76s)]
*  And he seemed like this like I thought he was like a wizard you know and he's like a UFC guy like he's a very interesting dude I don't think people would say he's a wizard though and he's I would like had no energy so I was like I felt pretty bested that day. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1891.76s)]
*  I think sometimes there's times where you get with comedy I think it's good with podcasting because you can do the conversations again. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1906.76s)]
*  I would but I think doing something like rapping that kind of thing feels really scary because people judge bars of raps and stuff all the time. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1914.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1924.76s)]
*  They don't do that with comedy nobody's like oh dude Larry had some shit bars over here you know. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1925.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1930.76s)]
*  It's like they're not doing that so they might say when somebody has a couple of good jokes but that would be scary to me to be like okay I'm going to rest on these lines and put them out. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1931.76s)]
*  Has there been something you put out where you're like because I put out some specials where I'm like I know that the recording that night wasn't the best. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1942.76s)]
*  I know that like after the audio came out I'm like these people I was working with didn't do didn't capture it the best. I know that I probably could have been in a better position and taking care of myself better the weeks leading up to it so I was putting out something as good as I could. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1949.76s)]
*  With your work you got to feel like you get a chance to be like okay this is it. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1965.76s)]
*  Is there ever a point where you like started something and by the end you were like fuck but I still got to put it out. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1970.76s)]
*  No I would never put out something if I like wasn't behind it like if I wasn't behind it even if it's like some fun shit or because that was one thing that was really tough to navigate through this last decade because you know I'm known as a fucking lyricist like I rap you know. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1976.76s)]
*  But I've also broken out of that box and made pop music I've made trap music I've sang I've done indie records I've done all types of stuff because I just that's me I want to do different shit you know it's like you've acted you have a podcast you're so much more than just you know just a comedian quote unquote. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=1991.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2008.76s)]
*  You know and that's how I thought about myself so the hardest thing was was navigating like people what other people thought and what other people said because I did care and because I wanted to be accepted so much like I literally it was so obvious and apparent but that's because I love hip hop and it's a beautiful space but the thing is I was always accepted by the greats the people in this you know industry whether it's Wu-Tang Clan, Nas like so many people that I've come into contact Q-Tip you know. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2009.76s)]
*  I mean you've worked with all of them. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2037.76s)]
*  Yeah and they give me my flowers and it's really amazing but for so long I was so focused on like well I want to be accepted by I don't know like the tastemaker or somebody with a fucking podcast. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2038.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2048.76s)]
*  It's like fuck them and their podcast I rap. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2049.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2051.76s)]
*  And when I. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2052.76s)]
*  Or any fucktard any fucktard in a Honda Accord with fucking loud pipes on that bitch dude it's like ah fuck does that guy like me you know. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2053.76s)]
*  No but that's a real thing though. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2062.76s)]
*  That's what I'm saying that's a real thing that would be like that's a dude it's like instead of really if you know if the greats are giving you your rewards but I'm still listening to this motherfuckers driving by and he's listening to Nelly still I'd be like fuck dude I'm missing somebody. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2063.76s)]
*  I'm missing a bandaid. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2078.76s)]
*  I love Nelly but I'm just saying yeah it's like I'm missing something. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2079.76s)]
*  I get it. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2081.76s)]
*  I think having my son do you have children? [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2082.76s)]
*  Having my son really totally open my eyes about how much shit doesn't fucking matter. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2086.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2091.76s)]
*  My son this thing that came out of my nuts is healthy and happy so Joe Schmoe talking shit about me like who gives a fuck. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2092.76s)]
*  Also it's like I'm rich and I'm famous and you're talking about me like good job like bro you did it like mission accomplished you met the green lizard alligator at the end of the fucking game like you did it. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2099.76s)]
*  And so for me that realization and this is just in the last few years because my biggest thing was I used to be so upset that it hurt when people would say mean things about me which they do on the internet all the time. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2111.76s)]
*  It's crazy shit. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2125.76s)]
*  I hope your baby dies your wife's ugly or that and when you see that every day every day all these different things just people that shit that people spew out it can fucking affect you. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2126.76s)]
*  And so I used to be so angry like fuck like why does this hurt. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2134.76s)]
*  Why does this hurt. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2137.76s)]
*  And then I realized it's like bro it hurts because you're a human being and you have emotions. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2138.76s)]
*  And when I stopped being so hard on myself and I was like bro it's OK that it hurts. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2142.76s)]
*  What you're in control of is how long will you let that affect you and how much will you let it affect you. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2147.76s)]
*  And now if I see some shit if I subject myself to being on the internet and I see some shit I just kind of like fuck this guy and that's it. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2152.76s)]
*  And it's pretty cool. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2159.76s)]
*  But it used to keep me up. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2160.76s)]
*  So what helped you turn there because that's really some AA type stuff. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2162.76s)]
*  It's like you know if I sit there and read something about it and I feel start to feel a certain way that's normal that kind of can happen. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2165.76s)]
*  But if I sit there and continue to feel that way then I'm doing that to myself at a certain point I don't realize it. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2170.76s)]
*  This that thing is the instigator but if I'm sitting there and still thinking about it then that's a choice that I'm making really at a certain point. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2176.76s)]
*  We're still going through it. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2182.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2184.76s)]
*  Because I used to. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2185.76s)]
*  I used to go in like people would be like oh you're amazing. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2186.76s)]
*  I love your comedy. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2189.76s)]
*  I love I love your albums. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2190.76s)]
*  I love and it's just so much love. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2192.76s)]
*  I love you. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2193.76s)]
*  I love you. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2194.76s)]
*  But then we look and it's like you fucking suck. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2195.76s)]
*  And you're like oh my God. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2197.76s)]
*  And you look at the guy you look at him he's fucking 14 plays Xbox he's a cunt. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2198.76s)]
*  And you're like like this whole thing when like deep down like it doesn't matter why we do this ourselves. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2202.76s)]
*  But I think a big part of it is what it what it means to be human and adaptation. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2208.76s)]
*  So when you think about like us fucking on like an African plane thousands of years ago. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2213.76s)]
*  Oh yeah like Big Buck Hunter. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2219.76s)]
*  Type shit type beat. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2220.76s)]
*  And when we walk out of the brush like nobody's going wow look at these beautiful clouds. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2222.76s)]
*  Look at this Scott. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2229.76s)]
*  No you're looking for lions immediately. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2230.76s)]
*  And so I think that's what we do on like today. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2232.76s)]
*  Fast forward. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2235.76s)]
*  We're looking for where's the threat. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2236.76s)]
*  Where's the threat. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2238.76s)]
*  And now I'm just kind of like man I honestly don't know why the fuck I cared so much for so long. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2239.76s)]
*  You know what I mean. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2247.76s)]
*  Well it would make sense if like you cared if you're looking for. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2248.76s)]
*  I mean I feel like especially as children especially growing up you're probably looking for adoration. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2250.76s)]
*  Everybody wants to be seen or accepted. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2256.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2259.76s)]
*  I don't know you seem to have adapted pretty well. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2260.76s)]
*  Yeah yeah it's not like it was ever terrible but there was just times when it was. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2263.76s)]
*  But and the reason I love to discuss things whenever I such as this whenever you know we kind of reach the subject. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2268.76s)]
*  For people out there is it's like bro you're not alone. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2274.76s)]
*  Like it's a real thing not to sound cliche but like everybody goes through shit. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2276.76s)]
*  Everybody you go on the Internet you're going to fight with some asshole that it could like it can it can affect you. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2279.76s)]
*  And just the sheer amount of shit that we see and process mentally daily like I don't think humans are even supposed to be doing that. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2284.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2291.76s)]
*  Like think if it's like 1950 you know and little little Mary Jane like this bitch didn't have Twitter and all and just see all the shit with all these girls half naked by fucking 13 being like. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2292.76s)]
*  Being over sexualized and she's like I need to change myself and I did all like that shit didn't exist. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2303.76s)]
*  Well that's you know I wonder a lot of times I think you know and I've jerked off recently I'm going to be honest with everybody but I think that a lot of times we've exhausted our sexuality. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2308.76s)]
*  So like you know I feel like you're you're even maybe even through a DNA strain you're only supposed to see so much cooter and everything over time and ass or whatever. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2320.76s)]
*  I actually agree with that. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2329.76s)]
*  Oh so it's crazy that now you're having children I think that have no sex because you fucking you know Ronnie the daddy or whatever spewed it all out dude that's why fucking Ernie is just sitting in the yard fucking licking rocks and scrolling on TikTok because he can't even he don't even have anything left in him. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2330.76s)]
*  You know it's like it's weird like whenever we created digital media it's like we burned it out all out of us. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2349.76s)]
*  I think there's a lot of men out there who are gay not even because they want to be it's because they all the straightness got jerked out of them over time by looking at pornography. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2354.76s)]
*  Wait what? [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2364.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2365.76s)]
*  Think about pornography bro it goes on to write what you're saying. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2366.76s)]
*  Bro if somebody wants to be fucking gay they're just gay. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2368.76s)]
*  Oh well some people are. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2371.76s)]
*  But some people. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2372.76s)]
*  You're saying some people their predecessors have just just busted so many nuts that they. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2373.76s)]
*  Or even them. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2379.76s)]
*  But there's a difference wait no but it's like. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2380.76s)]
*  Then what you're talking about is more so celibacy rather than a sexual orientation. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2382.76s)]
*  I don't know man I think we don't know the long term effects of some of this pornography think about it dude like like when you're saying back in the day you go to maybe the store and you see a woman pick up a melon. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2387.76s)]
*  Oh yeah for sure. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2396.76s)]
*  And you go jerk off in the truck. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2397.76s)]
*  And you think about it. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2398.76s)]
*  Oh that was insane every time you fucking see an avocado salad you fucking got to hide in the in the in the outhouse. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2399.76s)]
*  When I was a kid I used to fucking watch anime and I'd just be in my head thinking about like this anime bitch with big ass tits and I'm like 12 years old. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2407.76s)]
*  Oh yeah bro. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2413.76s)]
*  Because I didn't have anything I didn't have fucking porn I didn't have fucking internet you know what I'm saying I was busting nuts with a fucking pencil drawings. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2414.76s)]

*  I mean I was I was just really it bums me out if I do it a little bit it bums me out. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2546.76s)]
*  You know what I'm over porn. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2553.76s)]
*  I'm so over it. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2555.76s)]
*  We're told well they said they said this actually seven states push to require ID for watching porn online. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2556.76s)]
*  Louisiana just did this and I think this is one of the best things that's ever been done for sure. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2561.76s)]
*  Because dude I really do think logic that this this is ruined a lot of relationships. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2565.76s)]
*  It's like it used to be a woman was where any fantasy you had was directed towards your spouse towards your towards your wife. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2571.76s)]
*  And then now those fantasies are all exalt you that that person can't even compete with the the the the digitality of all this pornography. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2579.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2590.76s)]
*  What does that article say. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2591.76s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2592.76s)]
*  That I love Zach. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2593.76s)]
*  I love Zach. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2594.76s)]
*  Thanks bro. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2595.76s)]
*  He's good man. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2596.76s)]
*  And I've never told him that. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2597.76s)]
*  So I'm glad. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2598.76s)]
*  No he's great. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2599.76s)]
*  He is after decades of can we zoom in a little bit. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2600.76s)]
*  After decades of fretting over minors potentially being overexposed to pornography online several states are suddenly moving fast in 2023 to attempt to keep kids off porn sites by passing laws requiring age verification. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2604.76s)]
*  No but that's real. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2616.76s)]
*  I mean have you ever seen like those funny tick tocks or things where it's like literally eighth grade and the band's playing at lunch and then they'll stop and then the kid does the porn hub drum thing as like a joke. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2617.76s)]
*  And then all the kids laugh because they know it's it's fucking deep man because like I remember the first time I was exposed to pornography I was like five years old. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2627.76s)]
*  No. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2636.76s)]
*  Yeah but it was it was print. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2637.76s)]
*  That's how old I am. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2638.76s)]
*  It was print. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2639.76s)]
*  Yeah same. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2640.76s)]
*  It was print magazine but I just didn't understand. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2641.76s)]
*  I remember going up to my mother and once again she's a huge shitting on her here but I'm just being honest. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2643.76s)]
*  She's a fucking hypocrite because you know I was like what sex. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2648.76s)]
*  I was five years old and asked her and she was like. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2652.76s)]
*  That's sex and I'm like what the fuck. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2655.76s)]
*  Well she did that. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2657.76s)]
*  She did this she just went like that and I was like oh shit. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2658.76s)]
*  So then I went to my homies I was like yo check it out I'm having sex right now. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2660.76s)]
*  I'm like telling all my friends and shit they're like what the fuck. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2663.76s)]
*  But yeah I mean that's not like that bad like seeing seeing like a little nudie magazine when you're grown. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2667.76s)]
*  No. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2674.76s)]
*  I was growing up like but now it's fucking deep man. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2675.76s)]
*  Like I remember one of the first times I like was on the Internet watching porn like 2006 2007 where like I didn't even know where to go and I'm in like Yahoo like just typing shit and like some chicks like going down on this guy and then she like pukes all over his dick and I'm like scarred and I'm like oh my god like that is some shit. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2677.76s)]
*  People don't need to be exposed like a golden corral. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2697.76s)]
*  I know. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2699.76s)]
*  And now that's my fetish. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2700.76s)]
*  But it's like it's it's just a weird thing. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2701.76s)]
*  It's overexposure man. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2704.76s)]
*  It will it's crazy. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2705.76s)]
*  But the harm it does to us I think that's the things we don't know. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2706.76s)]
*  It's like that harm it used to be you would take all those feelings and you put them to every time you saw your spouse fantasize about him. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2709.76s)]
*  And if you're open if you're open you're like hey what's up you trying to wear this maid outfit and yeah you know pretend you know X Y Z like it's just to have those fantasies you know. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2716.76s)]
*  And my wife she's she's super open her fucking dad's probably watching this right now so I'm not going to get too deep into it. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2724.76s)]
*  But if you know what I mean. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2729.76s)]
*  But no she she's my wife man she's she's incredible. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2730.76s)]
*  You know what I mean. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2735.76s)]
*  She really satisfies me. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2736.76s)]
*  And that's another thing when I think like all through my 20s I was just like jerking off watching porn just because it was kind of a thing to do. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2737.76s)]
*  Not a lot not crazy. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2743.76s)]
*  I never had an addiction nothing like that. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2744.76s)]
*  You know and I've known some some some dudes who have and have beaten that which I think is great. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2745.76s)]
*  But I'm just like for what I kind of I'm almost like seen it like seen it all. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2750.76s)]
*  And now I want to just like not anymore and just focus on my personal sexual relationship with my wife. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2755.76s)]
*  Not that I'm not or haven't but just to even more. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2761.76s)]
*  I think porn has been so normalized in a way which is not as an adult like to each their own. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2764.76s)]
*  You know what I mean. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2774.76s)]
*  But I just think this shit about making sure that minors can't aren't really so exposed to it. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2775.76s)]
*  I think it is important. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2779.76s)]
*  But also some of these is someone's like guns. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2781.76s)]
*  You know sure you can have all the gun laws you want X Y Z. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2785.76s)]
*  I wonder what the comments are looking like right now. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2788.76s)]
*  Anyway you can have all these gun laws whatever. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2791.76s)]
*  But at the fucking end of the day bro somebody really really wants to fucking get a gun and kill somebody. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2793.76s)]
*  They're going to do it and they can even make a gun 3D print a fucking gun. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2797.76s)]
*  And that's but that's how I feel kind of about like porn where it's like if an underage you know teenager who's older wants to see that they're going to find a way to do it. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2800.76s)]
*  But if you make it more difficult then I think you're exposing less people to something that can essentially traumatize them. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2810.76s)]
*  You know you ever heard that show Euphoria. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2817.76s)]
*  I met someone from it one time at a party. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2819.76s)]
*  Well they really talk about in an incredible way how porn has just fucked with the youth thinking like yeah bitch take this dick. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2822.76s)]
*  Like all this and it's like that's really I mean it's a time and place you know what I'm saying. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2836.76s)]
*  It's definitely evening but you know like your first time. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2840.76s)]
*  Yeah you can't be like that and then a girl thinks like all this crazy and then here's the crazy part. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2845.76s)]
*  You're not even connecting with the other person at all. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2849.76s)]
*  Now you're almost performing actions that you've seen. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2852.76s)]
*  So then it's like the human connection it's totally gone. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2856.76s)]
*  It's like we're almost it's become weird because with porn you're almost start to and with everything digital you almost start to impersonate what you've seen. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2859.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2868.76s)]
*  So now we've taken art in all forms and some people consider porn art and that's fine. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2869.76s)]
*  We've taken art we've made art and now we're watching the art we've made and reenacting that we don't. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2874.76s)]
*  It's like we're we're done. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2880.76s)]
*  Yeah all I know is like my first time having sex I was like fucking Titanic. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2883.76s)]
*  Wow really. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2887.76s)]
*  Yeah I was like I love you. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2888.76s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2890.76s)]
*  Well also I never experienced true love like love. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2891.76s)]
*  I don't really believe like I love my mom and my dad but like not like I love my son not like I love my wife. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2894.76s)]
*  You know what I mean. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2903.76s)]
*  It sounds like that was a big change you like once you had a family kind of because sometimes you hear that a family will solve a lot of those old like wounds because you suddenly have a thing that it's not about this behind you anymore. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2904.76s)]
*  It's obviously about in front of you. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2915.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2917.76s)]
*  And when you're loving your son you kind of replenish that thing that you didn't get in a weird way. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2918.76s)]
*  It's like not even in a weird way. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2922.76s)]
*  That is it. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2924.76s)]
*  That is it. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2925.76s)]
*  And that's what's so crazy like just the fact you know it was going to be like that. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2926.76s)]
*  Like we're scared to get into a marriage. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2929.76s)]
*  We're scared to have a child like those are I wasn't scared to get a marriage this time because I got it right the second time. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2931.76s)]
*  Oh you did a first marriage. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2936.76s)]
*  I did a first marriage. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2937.76s)]
*  Wow. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2938.76s)]
*  That was hard. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2939.76s)]
*  And that was just it just wasn't my person. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2940.76s)]
*  There was no there was no like no infidelity. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2942.76s)]
*  No this no that is just and respectfully like I won't really get into it because that isn't my story to tell. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2945.76s)]
*  And that's a story that I would happily tell you you know if you over dinner or hanging out or whatever. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2951.76s)]
*  But publicly it's just just wasn't my person it wasn't right. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2956.76s)]
*  So when I found my wife now Brittany it was just like oh my God. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2959.76s)]
*  Like she and she got the wildest shit. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2964.76s)]
*  I felt like Leo like I found the bitch when she was 19. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2966.76s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2968.76s)]
*  You know Jerry Leo Lewis do bring up Jerry Lee Lewis. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2969.76s)]
*  He was a pedophile but he was. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2973.76s)]
*  Oh shit. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=2975.76s)]

*  logic whatever it's like I don't give a shit I'm not here to argue because you know there's people who's like well you don't you'll never understand what it's like to walk down the street as a black man and I'm like yo alright why don't you just shut the fuck up cuz you'll never understand what it's like to walk down the street as a black man and a white man's body and then wait let me shut the fuck up why are we arguing? [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=3975.08s)]
*  Yeah you're like Mrs. Doubtfire. But that's what I'm saying why are we arguing in the first place what you what you're going through I'm not denying what you're going through fuck all that shit so for me it's like yeah it's a it's a crazy thing like yeah and I love it you know motherfuckers used to always be like oh you talks about this all the time I'm like so the fuck what man I don't give a fuck I'm proud I like it you know what I mean you look at motherfucker Twitter bio and there should be like black and proud motherfucker I'm biracial I'm proud but I do feel I definitely code switch a lot you familiar with this [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=3993.72s)]
*  term? Uh-uh. Code switching is like if I was going into like a fucking interview or some shit I'm like well hello there sir yes I really like this job I really appreciate that thank you so much oh excuse me I have one call nigga what the fuck man you got my shit what you know what I mean so it's like that it is a part of you it's almost like you kind of feel like two like two different people but that's one thing in the culture as well it's like any anybody who's of the culture who meets me IRL that's some bullshit anybody who fucking really meets me shakes my hand they know what's up because it's not a thing why would it even be [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4023.72s)]
*  a thing it's not a thing it's only a thing on the internet it's only a thing on the internet like I've never met anybody and they're like no you're not you know like I just I'm just I'm because it's not a thing it's not a thing it's not a thing it's like I definitely love to let people know who I am so yeah when I meet somebody if they're like tell me about yourself first thing I had my fucking mouth black dad white mom dadada grew up broke it's just it's it's my fucking identity there's no identity crisis this is who the fuck I am [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4053.72s)]
*  and I know well it's also it's a responsibility in a weird way as you get older it's like you become this piece of an important time when people are discussing stuff and they want to know what things feel like and they want to know like you know and some people that don't know how to relate like I like always was envious I always was envious of black kids growing up like I grew up in like a half and half neighborhood right and I was real envious of black kids because I mean this may sound crazy but [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4083.72s)]
*  I like they at least had an excuse for how people treated them and looked at them in a weird way and it's not an excuse but I understand they like and then it was like if you were poor and white it was like you just fucked up somehow it was like how what the fuck how did you fuck up you know like you didn't that's like the white privilege thing which I agree with I think white privilege is always more to it exactly there's always so much more to it it's like we're just talking in like a specific moment but I always [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4113.72s)]
*  was like man I feel it was because I felt sometimes a similar way that some of my black friends felt yeah but you guys are of you're of the culture bro that's what I'm saying culture to me when I say of the culture I'm not talking about skin color I'm not talking about none of that shit it's like I grew up with Salvadorian kids and black kids and white kids and Asian homies and we were all from the same place we talked the same bro there was white home there was white people in our clique and [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4143.72s)]
*  it'd be like 14 black dudes three white guys and in my biracial ass and all the white the white boys would say nigga they do that's what they did they would say it because the black dudes are like hey say that shit say you down like that's the internet is a spray-painted on my legs sometimes I remember what I was like this is fucking what the fuck I don't want it this bad but yeah it's it's it's a it's a crazy thing but that's what I mean of the culture is like you understand that plight of like you know [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4173.72s)]
*  just well I mean did you grow up poor yeah yeah so then growing up broke and and and and and and longing for things and one thing and then having that connection so it's like damn you know like I never had the PlayStation right like I mean I did like later but I had like the like when everybody was on like the ps3 and shit that I finally got my playstation type type shit so yeah yeah yeah but but that's that's a big thing I think all this fighting on the internet of what is this or that because there's no like there's no voice there's no like ambassador of black people like you know what I mean [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4203.72s)]
*  or white people or this or Asian people like just cuz one black dude or white guy or says something it's like they don't fucking speak for an entire race of people let alone almost what you could consider like a denomination or just a a a group of people in a specific place because also like racism in America so different from racism in Europe or this or that or that like you know people have their different experiences with it in ways that we could never understand oh totally yeah yeah I could never understand what it was like to be [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4233.72s)]
*  what it's like to be something different than what I am you know I could try in moments you know I think one thing that I envied about black and it was mostly guys that I knew I didn't know a lot of black girls when I was a kid but just their origin story they had like a origin story you know it felt like they had like a history and a purpose and like I was like we're talking about fucking Marvel movie what do you mean but that's what it felt like it was like it was like if I don't know black it just felt like they had like a [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4263.72s)]
*  they were coming from a place it was obvious that they were coming like making they had to make a comeback in a way oh yeah Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I was like where is this going yes a hundred percent I mean right so they had like a fucking like they had like a thing that everybody knew that was obvious and it was like I think I always envied that a little bit it was like why why why would you envy because I feel so [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4293.72s)]
*  of these ways, but nobody knows it by looking at me. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4323.72s)]
*  I get it, but that's different. But once again, that isn't really so much of a race thing. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4327.0s)]
*  Even though what you're talking about, yeah, that's like fucking 400 years of slavery and [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4332.4400000000005s)]
*  oppression and fucking, yeah, a hundred percent. That's some deep shit. But what you're talking [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4335.68s)]
*  about is like the plight of man, bro. You came up with these people in your own way, [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4342.12s)]
*  though. You definitely don't have the same lineage or history that goes into a lot of [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4348.56s)]
*  emotion, confusion, need for education that black folk have about themselves. Whether [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4353.32s)]
*  it would be someone in Latin culture as well experiencing their own thing. But aren't you, [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4361.4s)]
*  what's your father? My father's from Nicaragua. I'm perceived mostly as white. But I mean, [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4369.88s)]
*  aren't you biracial? Yeah, but I don't have a dual citizenship. You don't need a citizenship, [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4375.679999999999s)]
*  motherfucker. DNA. What you talking about? DNA is your citizenship. So you're mixed technically. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4381.04s)]
*  So was your father light skinned? No, he was dark skinned kind of. Welcome to the club, [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4387.28s)]
*  shit. What the fuck you mean? But that's what I mean. But do you perceive yourself as white? [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4392.68s)]
*  No, people call us like, my brother's real dark skinned and people would call us like, [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4398.4s)]
*  what do they call, Puerto Ricans when I was growing up. That was like the big thing that [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4404.24s)]
*  people called you out. Yeah, they didn't have any Mexicans back then. So for some reason, [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4410.679999999999s)]
*  some people I thought about Maryland. There was like no Mexicans. There's just a bunch of [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4413.759999999999s)]
*  Salvadorans and I was just eating pupusas all the time. They're so fire. But wait, [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4417.44s)]
*  we had a group called whites against Mexicans actually in our town for a little bit, but we [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4421.4s)]
*  didn't have any Mexicans. So it was just like, I think they kind of roughed up this Chinese kid. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4425.44s)]
*  What the fuck? Okay. So how do you perceive yourself? Or at least how did you growing up? [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4431.28s)]
*  Did you perceive yourself as white? Cause I think my dad was so old. I was so embarrassed [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4438.64s)]
*  of anything to do with him that I didn't want to know about it or learn about it. You know, [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4443.200000000001s)]
*  I mean, my dad grew up in a village where people would eat dirt. They didn't have anything to eat [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4448.12s)]
*  and they would eat dirt and get sick and die all the time. I remember him telling me stuff about [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4452.8s)]
*  that. But I didn't care. I think I rejected him so much in a weird way, cause he was so much older [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4457.08s)]
*  every time he was around, even though I long to like kind of know him more, I think it was so [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4465.96s)]
*  embarrassing once I kind of became like of age where I knew what my friends, the looks on their [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4472.44s)]
*  faces. Isn't that so annoying too? Like, no, but not even fuck those kids, but just you that you [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4476.599999999999s)]
*  were so young and that gets almost like, imagine not to write, but if I could be me now, exactly. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4481.32s)]
*  I would accept all of it and just talk about all the things that you could learn, but it's all good. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4487.16s)]
*  You know what I mean? That's life and that's where you stood. And you were a kid, you were [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4492.8s)]
*  being normal though. It's not like you were like some piece of shit. You know what I mean? It's [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4500.04s)]
*  like, you were just like, dad, you know what I mean? It was like, dad, drop me off around the block. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4503.320000000001s)]
*  Like, don't pull up. So I get that. They had, what was that? Did you see the thing they had, [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4509.84s)]

*  a Salvadorian caretaker. Do you know the thing I'm talking about in Miami? The second graders, [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4519.28s)]

*  they gave them jobs and shit though. I mean, damn, you're kidding. No, but here's what happened. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4540.8s)]
*  There's a Salvadorian. Can you find the people that run this preschool in Miami are from [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4547.92s)]
*  Argentina. So they don't know the culture here as much. Oh, I understood. So this was black [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4554.0s)]
*  history month. So they were just, so they had these kids and they, some of the white kids, [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4559.04s)]
*  they wanted them to be able to be black. And so, and then you got these little innocent little kids [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4562.88s)]
*  that don't know what the fuck is going on. Well, the crazy thing is they blurred the kids face out. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4568.88s)]
*  Oh yeah. Like that's going to make it different. That makes it look even worse. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4573.36s)]
*  It looks like eight bit fucking, yo, that's, that's wild. Only blackface I've ever really [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4577.839999999999s)]
*  personally experienced. Um, is this Rolex I got? Oh, gang. Yeah. This shit is dope. Yeah. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4583.599999999999s)]
*  It's actually in Japanese Kanji too, which is, uh, which is a vibe. Is that, uh, let me see. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4588.639999999999s)]
*  It's from Tokyo. Oh, dang. That's nice. And is that stone inside of it? What you mean? [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4593.12s)]

*  of? I don't know. It might be onyx or something. I don't fucking know. Cause this show, yeah. Cause [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4604.48s)]
*  well the, um, yeah, the blackface stuff comes from like menstrual shows. They had like, I think it [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4608.32s)]
*  was like 200, 150 years ago, they had like shows where they wouldn't let black performers perform. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4613.28s)]
*  So they made them, so they made white people, they had them put black stuff on their face. Right. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4618.96s)]
*  So I think that's where a lot of the, obviously the origins of people being against it, you know, [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4624.0s)]
*  that it makes people feel uncomfortable. I just wonder if at a certain point, like if it's a two [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4630.08s)]
*  year old kid, what the fuck does he, you know, and it's like, yeah, but, but a two year old kid [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4634.16s)]
*  ain't applying blackface to himself. There's an adult doing that. Like, let's just be real. No, [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4639.92s)]
*  you know what I'm saying? What the fuck? First of all, where does this kid have accent access [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4646.72s)]
*  to paint or shoe polish? Like they was doing back in the day. Like where, like it's no, this is, [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4650.96s)]
*  this is an adult. Now this specific thing, it's like, oh, okay. They were, it was like a Latin [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4655.44s)]

*  making fun of the racism of Hollywood at the time by casting a white guy to play a black guy. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4728.8s)]
*  It was really another guy and a guy with another guy. Survive, survive. Like, and that's just like, [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4735.52s)]
*  man, when I was 18 years old and I watched that, I was like, this is fucking hilarious. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4741.84s)]
*  Right. But it's, I believe that the shit was done right. It was tasteful. It was this, it was, [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4745.76s)]
*  it was, I mean, even when there's a moment in the movie when he's like, [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4750.96s)]
*  a white character is talking to him as he's in blackface and he's like, some, some you people. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4754.72s)]
*  And he's like, what do you mean you people? And then, and then the black homies, the actor, [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4759.92s)]
*  he's like, what the fuck you mean? You people. That's funny, bro. That's funny. And so question [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4763.92s)]
*  for you as a comedian, like where do we draw the line? Cause I feel like shit's easing up a bit. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4769.360000000001s)]
*  And I think, I think with the, I know, we all know where it started. Harvey Weinstein, Me Too [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4775.68s)]
*  Movement, cancel culture. Like it became this crazy, almost over correction, but I'm happy it [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4780.08s)]
*  happened just because like, there's a lot of shit, pieces of shit in the industry that were getting [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4785.68s)]
*  away with a lot of stuff. Now there's a big difference between like, I made a little mistake [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4790.16s)]
*  or da da da, whatever. And then just like straight up rape and things like that. So it was, I think [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4794.48s)]
*  it was really good that that happened, but then, yeah, a hundred percent. It was, it was incredible [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4800.48s)]
*  that these women were given a voice and given power and, you know, taking back power that was [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4804.88s)]
*  essentially stripped from them, which is disgusting. And that's something I've dealt, [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4809.92s)]
*  seen the women in my life deal with personally. So I got that now fast forward, you know, a couple [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4814.0s)]
*  years that I, and then you just making jokes and shit. Like I saw this one girl, they was trying to [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4819.04s)]
*  cancel this girl in high school. I was watching it, you know, H3H3, it's like, yeah, Ethan Kahn. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4822.8s)]
*  Yeah. Ethan. So like, Ethan did this, not bit, but you know, you know, and he did this thing where [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4828.0s)]
*  he's talking about this, this little white girl who's wearing a, like a kimono prom dress. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4832.64s)]
*  And then everybody's like, that's cultural appropriation. Like this girl's not allowed [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4837.76s)]
*  to wear a kimono. She's not Japanese. Like all this shit. Right. And I was just like, [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4842.64s)]
*  God damn, this is fucking crazy. Cause I'm like wearing a, I'm like wearing a fucking kimono, [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4846.320000000001s)]

*  And I'm like, where am I? Shit. You know, I think I'm turning in Japanese. Like I'm fucking vibing it [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4855.4400000000005s)]
*  over there and I'm supporting the economy. I'm buying it. It's a fucking little Japanese woman [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4859.28s)]
*  who's like, you know, half the doma de kato gazamastai, half this, thank you very much. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4864.24s)]
*  And I'm like, oh, that's dope. Does that mean I'm culturally, what the fuck? Like, I don't know. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4868.16s)]
*  Now this is a hot take, but I'm just simply saying that's kind of crazy. You know what I mean? [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4872.32s)]
*  Yeah. Like she, it wasn't like she was like straight traditional even, even then though, [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4877.84s)]
*  but it was just like, she was just like wearing a cute little, a little thing and they was trying [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4882.8s)]
*  to destroy this, this girl. So as a comedian, how do you feel when people be really like, [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4886.56s)]
*  did you see what happened to, you know, Troy bond? You know who Troy bond is? Bring him up. Yo, [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4893.200000000001s)]
*  you don't know Troy bond. Troy bond. Yo, okay. First of all, Troy bond is the future of comedy. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4897.52s)]
*  Is he really this kid? Yeah. Quote, tweet this motherfucker. He's on, he's on tick tock. He's [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4902.240000000001s)]
*  incredible. And if you go to it, you might be able to see it here. Uh, if you go to his, yeah, [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4907.4400000000005s)]
*  keep scrolling down. You should, it's, uh, fuck. You're like, I met him before and he's a gay [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4914.64s)]
*  gentleman. No, he's not gay, but, uh, he, he, he does refer to himself as a Puerto Rican lesbian, [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4918.8s)]
*  but he's actually black and white. He made a joke about how he looks like. It looks like that. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4926.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. He looks like that killer member. Who? Jeffrey Donovan, Ronnie Rodriguez or whatever. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4931.280000000001s)]
*  Oh, the fucking, um, yeah. What was that guy? The guy, the fucking, you talking about the dude? [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4935.4400000000005s)]
*  Zodiac? No, not the Zodiac. I think it's Ronnie Rodriguez. Who was it? [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4940.4800000000005s)]
*  We go from Troy bond to Ronnie Rodriguez. Dude, somebody's got to kill bro. I'll tell you this. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4944.24s)]
*  They are. Yeah. No, that's not, you're thinking Ramirez, Ramirez, Ronnie Ramirez. You're thinking [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4949.36s)]
*  of Ramirez, the fucking whatever Ronnie Ramirez, the Zodiac salesman or whatever. But listen, so [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4955.84s)]
*  if you, I don't know if you have tick tock up there, if you can go to tick tock or if somebody [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4960.639999999999s)]
*  can try to get you this clip. Cause I think it's really important that you show it on the show. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4963.92s)]
*  And the reason is, is because so he's black and white, but I'm going to be honest, he, he looks [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4967.28s)]
*  like he could, he could be white or something else or, you know, he's kind of like yourself. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4972.16s)]
*  Like, yeah. And so he's doing this, um, this great set. We'll find it. We'll find it. He's [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4976.08s)]
*  doing this great set and this girl screams at him and she's like, that's so fucking racist, [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4985.28s)]
*  blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And she doesn't even know that he's, that he's mixed. You get a lot of [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4992.8s)]
*  that in clubs these days. So I'm just like, why the fuck would you go to the club, to a comedy show? [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=4997.04s)]
*  You see the bill, you know, pretty much who's going to be there that night. Who's got time, [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5004.24s)]
*  you know, I've only ever been to a comedy club once. We'll talk about that in a bit, but [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5007.92s)]
*  what is that like? Well, I think this is what's happened. I think this is what's happened. I think [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5012.16s)]
*  you have, I don't think you have as much racism in the world as you did 25 years ago. I really [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5016.32s)]
*  don't. I think what you have these days, you have a lot of division that happens from people [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5023.76s)]
*  like online. You have a lot of people that have marketed the past and it's great to be reminded [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5029.280000000001s)]
*  by the past undeniably, right? We still have a lot of recovering to do from the past. I think some [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5035.360000000001s)]
*  cultures, even genetically, they have to work. It will take time for their DNA to heal from traumas [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5042.16s)]
*  of the past, no doubt. But I think now you get a lot of the past marketed, packaged in the clips [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5048.96s)]
*  in the movies where you're constantly reminded of the fucked up things of the past to the point [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5055.52s)]
*  where some people that just becomes their identity now. So they don't have any real human connection [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5064.8s)]
*  to it. They just have this sort of like, it's almost like, I don't want to say it's an educational [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5070.24s)]
*  connection, but it's just like, oh, I see this, that's racist. There's no, I don't have any [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5076.08s)]
*  texture to it. There's no history to it for me. It's just something that I see now online and I [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5082.96s)]
*  know that that's supposed to be racist. What's also crazy to me is when there is history tied. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5088.5599999999995s)]
*  So for example, I wrote this movie script a couple of years ago called Jerry about a homeless comedian [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5093.04s)]
*  who tells jokes on Venice for a dollar. And one night he's telling stand up jokes, all types of [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5096.88s)]
*  jokes. He's telling black jokes, white jokes, gay jokes. It's just being funny. He's being himself. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5103.28s)]
*  Okay, Jerry. And he makes a joke about, I forget it now, but it's something along the lines of like, [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5107.92s)]
*  oh man, could you imagine if like a South Central blood had leukemia, he would be like the illest [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5113.92s)]
*  blood of all time because it's a blood condition. Anyway, it's a lot funnier with the way that I [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5122.639999999999s)]
*  wrote it. And in the crowd, this woman who was laughing hysterically stops and starts heckling [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5127.12s)]
*  the man, heckling the man, heckling the man. And then she's just like, how could you possibly say [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5137.36s)]
*  that? And he doesn't even argue with her. And his manager, Mike, which is the character I'd like to [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5141.2s)]
*  play, is like, dude, why didn't you say anything to that woman? And he goes, you know, a lot of [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5147.12s)]
*  people tend to be hypocrites. She's a middle-aged white lady. She wants to laugh at black jokes. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5152.4s)]
*  She wants to laugh at gay jokes. He's like, it's very apparent. It's either her, her mom, her dad, [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5157.599999999999s)]
*  somebody died of a blood disease, bro. And it was just really cool because I've taken my own [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5164.08s)]
*  experience when writing that about what triggers people and what I've seen trigger people. And I [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5171.759999999999s)]
*  just think it's really kind of annoying that people like to pick and choose. Don't get me wrong. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5176.4s)]
*  It's almost like if somebody was to make a Parkinson's joke. I actually, I made a joke. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5183.12s)]
*  I had a- You don't know Parkinson's. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5189.599999999999s)]
*  I don't, but I'll tell you something. It's actually wild. So a gentleman named Chewie does all my [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5192.24s)]
*  tattoos. I met him through Travis Barker. I saw him on your Instagram. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5198.08s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. And so he asked me to give him a tattoo. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5200.4s)]
*  He did that Metal Gear Solid when it took about six or seven hours. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5203.44s)]
*  Exactly. You spent your time. You care. You just looked at it. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5205.5199999999995s)]
*  That was a cool one actually. It reminded me of that game too. Go on. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5209.04s)]
*  I love that game. So Wu-Tang, I have a Wu-Tang tattoo right here. And he was like, [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5211.36s)]
*  I want you to give me a Wu-Tang tattoo. And this was like five years ago. And I jokingly, [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5215.599999999999s)]
*  I'm like, y'all don't want to see that shit. It looks like Michael J. Fox did it [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5219.12s)]
*  because it's all squiggly and fucked up. Oh yeah, bad off. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5222.32s)]
*  But I go, don't worry, I can make that joke. It's kind of like saying the N word. I was like, [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5224.5599999999995s)]
*  because I'm black. And I said, because I have dystonia. So dystonia, I have cervical dystonia. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5231.12s)]
*  I don't have a cervix. Cervical is a, it's your neck. And basically my head shakes like this. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5237.04s)]

*  like such a young, bad bitch. No, they go deep in there. It's why Botox was invented. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5254.48s)]
*  And so they go all the way into weaken the muscle. Cause my muscle, I know bro, it's fucking crap. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5259.2s)]
*  Did they put you down when you do it? No, I do it. I do it every three months. I'm supposed to, [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5263.2s)]

*  Yeah. It's shaking a little bit now. So I got to do it. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5268.72s)]
*  But what I'm saying is, is like, bro, people die of Parkinson's disease. You know, Ryan Reynolds [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5273.92s)]
*  father passed away. Like he had to experience it. So it's like, when I make a joke like that, [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5279.04s)]
*  I think it's really how it's just, it's just how you do it. Like that's a man's pain, bro. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5283.599999999999s)]

*  cope. And with a man that I can relate to, to some degree, not to that degree, obviously. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5315.68s)]
*  And I just think it's kind of crazy that if you're a good comedian, no, if you're a fucking great [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5322.0s)]
*  comedian, you use pain and you use trauma such as Chappelle and your prior and so many great people [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5327.04s)]
*  to talk about the hard things. And so I think I love Chappelle because no matter what your motherfuckers [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5333.68s)]

*  something to be said about, yeah, it's just like, bro, that's a group of people just in general that [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5420.96s)]
*  are fucking, they are killing in Hollywood. Like, you know what I'm saying? Like, it's just a real, [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5426.4s)]

*  unwell? Yes. Right. So at a certain point- I don't think he's fucking, I don't think he's crazy. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5496.88s)]
*  Right. He may be man. I think he may have some different issues. I think, yeah, I think he's [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5501.68s)]
*  bipolar and I think he's, but he's mentally unwell. I don't think he's like, fuck crazy. Like, [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5504.8s)]

*  On stage in front of the entire world? Right. But that's exactly goes into my point. I was [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5531.04s)]
*  going to make is that, or that I was going to bring up is that at what point should the media [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5535.68s)]
*  stop putting some dude out there if they know he's mentally unwell, the same media that has [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5540.56s)]
*  run an advertisements for like people are mentally unwell, get help, get help. And then they're taking [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5546.16s)]

*  just my rise, like I was the underground underdog. Everybody wants that fucking underdog to win. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5574.64s)]
*  And then when they win, it's like, oh, he's killing it, killing it. But like, [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTPUzsGu4U&t=5579.4400000000005s)]
