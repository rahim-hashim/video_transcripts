*  It's always a good time chatting with the one and only Mr. Mike Roach. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=55.48s)]
*  Oh, he's bringing him a coffee. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=79.24s)]
*  That's how they like you really got to work for it. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=81.83999999999999s)]
*  See this is a difference between today. Look, this is the difference between [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=91.56s)]
*  my parents and us today. This is how you got a cup of coffee. We like my grandparents. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=95.32s)]
*  Yeah, they would serve it like this. Yep, and you figure it out. Good luck figure it out, man. You're on your own and here we are. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=100.64s)]
*  Well, remember the last time I was at your place. I [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=107.47999999999999s)]
*  had rolled out of the hotel come to your house. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=110.88000000000001s)]
*  I wasn't quite sure who you were or where I was or anything and all I knew was I needed coffee and you ordered some [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=113.32000000000001s)]
*  for me and they brought it in and it was so freaking hot. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=119.44s)]
*  I didn't make a big deal about it, but we were like two minutes into our conversation. I thought [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=123.80000000000001s)]
*  damn it, man. I just I literally cleaved my tongue to the roof of my mouth there for a second. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=128.92000000000002s)]
*  I wonder if I could still be interesting and I just powered through and besides you know what it's whatever. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=133.92000000000002s)]
*  Well, thanks for doing that man. Oh, that's the worst bro when you drink something so hot, but you want to be a man. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=139.35999999999999s)]
*  That's why I think our grandfathers no wonder they couldn't express their feelings. They couldn't talk. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=146.35999999999999s)]
*  You know how hot the coffee was then? It was it was magma. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=150.64s)]
*  Yeah, and and how jacked up their teeth were. They were in constant pain. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=154.51999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, people died of their teeth back then all the time. Yeah, we lost at least a grandfather [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=158.5s)]
*  who is to teeth infection or to gum infection. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=163.23999999999998s)]
*  At least but yeah people died. It was crazy. It's bananas. Yeah, I am I [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=167.04s)]
*  bit my lip the other day and [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=173.28s)]
*  This is a this is a funny thing for me anyway, but the third like the first time you do it [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=176.68s)]
*  It's it's it's annoying and it really takes you out of your meal takes you out of your conversation [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=181.12s)]
*  Yeah, and part of the reason is because you know, it's gonna happen again. And then when you do it again [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=185.35999999999999s)]
*  It's a different kind of rage [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=190.76s)]
*  Right and because it's tinged with the inevitability like it's gonna happen and then we bite it the third time [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=192.92s)]
*  It's just white hot pain and like an anger at the universe and it's irrational [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=200.32s)]
*  yeah, but it's it's just one of those things when I and [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=205.79999999999998s)]
*  And maybe four or five times you're gonna bite it and it's gonna be like that for the next 24 hours [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=209.79999999999998s)]
*  And so your body finally sends some sort of message and and the swelling starts to go down [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=213.68s)]
*  But it is a it's a it's a horrible moment in your day when you start that crucible, it's an oral Vietnam, man [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=218.92000000000002s)]
*  There's nothing like that going down that journey the D day of every bite you take and one of them is gonna land [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=226.64000000000001s)]
*  Step on that on that hidden [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=234.08s)]
*  IED of a previously bitten inner lip [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=237.36s)]
*  Can we get him some coffee just gonna happen again [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=242.28s)]
*  Some cream they just bring you more coffee more, you know, it's maybe I should I used to drink [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=245.72s)]
*  I used to drink black all the time and then I went two creams and one cream and [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=250.48s)]
*  You know what? I find my it [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=255.07999999999998s)]
*  Upsets people when you change your coffee order like the people around you in your circle [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=257.52s)]
*  Like I always thought you were a black coffee. Oh, yeah, and now what's with the cream or what's with the almond milk? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=262.28s)]
*  You don't do that. That sends a whole different message. Yeah, definitely in some communities that is not good [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=267.4s)]
*  Well, there's no it's not good there's no nipples on the almond [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=273.12s)]
*  Yeah, and if you're looking for him you are a Randy character. Well, you can't I mean you [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=277.3s)]
*  Curiosity would require some some kind of cursory inspection from this milk delivery system with no nipples. Oh look at you Zach [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=283.32s)]
*  That's amazing. Thank you very much. Where do you get those out of did you go into the cow? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=291.28s)]
*  I saw the one we have is expired. Did you really oh my you went to the corner to get me some of these little poisonous pods [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=297.1s)]
*  This these are good. There's a hole. Oh, yeah. Why why is everything they have melatonin in them now? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=305.02s)]
*  I'm like should coffee creamer have melatonin in it. I don't know. I'm that is that didn't that stuff that makes you tired [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=311.32s)]
*  Yeah, that's like what's going on. That is a mixed message. I know here's some here's some caffeine with a little sedative for you [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=316.98s)]
*  Which lets your body sort it out. Yeah, it's where we are next thing [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=323.28000000000003s)]
*  You know, you're biting through your lip cursing the universe oral Vietnam dying to your teeth. Oh [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=326.24s)]
*  Dude, did you have any idea how much I mean feedback I got I [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=332.96000000000004s)]
*  don't I [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=337.72s)]
*  Don't know if this happens to you [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=339.16s)]
*  Like you see yourself maybe on YouTube and it's clearly you right? This is a thing. You're like, you don't dispute it [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=341.08000000000004s)]
*  It's you you did whatever it is whatever conversation you're having. Yeah, but you don't have any real recollection of the conversation [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=346.8s)]
*  Yeah, you're just seeing yourself right like this happened to me a lot years ago when people started uploading these [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=352.56s)]
*  these incidents on QVC [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=361.32s)]
*  Like in the middle of the night where I had been, you know fired for various inappropriate interactions with product [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=364.08s)]
*  Oh, you were on QVC. Oh, yeah. Yeah, but but when like when I look at those old [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=370.24s)]
*  clips [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=375.88s)]
*  And and I can't deny that it's me but I have absolutely no idea what's going to happen [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=377.48s)]
*  Yeah, or what I'm gonna say next it very unusual. It's like biting your lip [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=382.8s)]
*  Yeah, because nothing you do about it. You just sit there and you watch yourself doing things [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=387.28s)]
*  You don't remember doing and you just hope you just hope to God you don't you know blow it [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=390.68s)]
*  I didn't know you got involved in this seriously involved. This is the dark arts selling jewelry to people that are high on sleeping pills [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=394.6s)]
*  Yeah, I mean their lonely hearts there, you know that look at my nails so nicely manicured and all that that was 1989 [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=403.79999999999995s)]
*  You selling those? Or 90? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=410.84s)]
*  Were you going to a poison concert? What were you even wearing those for? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=412.76s)]
*  You know, I mean as long as you're gonna do it find the cat sack that's what I knew my life had taken a weird turn [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=417.5s)]
*  This was 1990. It was my first job in TV. Was it really that's crazy. I don't even know that. Oh, yeah [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=424.06s)]
*  Yeah, oh my gosh, look at you look at that hair right where were you from Transylvania? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=430.52s)]
*  so this is a lava lamp right and I'm I [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=437.76s)]
*  Have no idea how to behave. I I just want to know if it's really hot. Well, guess what dude? It's hot man [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=441.64s)]
*  I put two creamers in it's like [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=447.84s)]
*  That lava. I mean that obviously it's not really lava. It's magma. No, no, it's not lava [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=450.0s)]
*  I open this thing up on the air [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=455.68s)]
*  Just because it's three in the morning, right and you're just trying to make sense out of whatever they bring you next [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=458.52s)]
*  It could be the amp core negative ion generator. It could be the health team infrared pain reliever could be a lava lamp [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=465.08s)]
*  Oh, yeah, it could be a child's diaper that sorts coins. They brought me a [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=471.36s)]
*  Cat sack k-8t [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=476.64s)]
*  Essex cat sack [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=479.2s)]
*  I thought it was a joke. It's not it's a it's like a [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=481.2s)]
*  Grocery bag lined with mylar. All right, and your cat crawls in it. It makes a crinkling sound and cats love it [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=485.23999999999995s)]
*  Oh, that's nice. So this is the kind of thing man. You just I would sit there for three hours in the middle of the night [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=491.96s)]
*  Trying it. There's no there was no training program or anything, you know [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=499.0s)]
*  They just they would just bring you these things that look [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=502.08s)]
*  Look like you'd get them out of that machine on the Carnival Midway with the claw. Oh, yeah [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=505.08s)]
*  You know, it was it was really just stuff that had failed to sell in prime time [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=510.91999999999996s)]
*  And so if you're new there's no training program [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=515.08s)]
*  They just put you on the middle of the night and they just bring you this stuff man [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=518.1600000000001s)]
*  One thing after the next you talk for eight minutes. I love that we should bring that back [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=521.32s)]
*  What if we brought something like that back? Well, I mean QVC is still on it's just that back in those days [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=526.12s)]
*  No one really knew about it. They didn't have any big vendors or anything today, you know [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=533.1600000000001s)]
*  They do six seven billion dollars a year. It's even really giant. It's huge home shopping is huge [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=538.1600000000001s)]
*  Wonder if we should do what if we did a fun one on like YouTube and we sold American products that were American made [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=543.32s)]
*  Mike I'm not I'm in I'm in it. Look there are no new ideas [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=549.12s)]

*  I love that home shopping never really went away [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=570.32s)]
*  Telethons were great though. You'd call up and you'd be like who's crippled [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=573.8000000000001s)]
*  Sometimes my stepdad would get drunk or whatever, right? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=576.86s)]
*  And he'd like want to impress on mom [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=579.2s)]
*  So we'd ring up one of those telethons that were on just a he'd be like, hey Randy who's crippled over there? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=581.24s)]
*  They like tell you who's crippled or whatever. He's like yeah put thirty dollars on that one [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=587.2s)]
*  Well, do you remember Jerry Lewis doing the telethons? I knew yep Jerry's kids Jerry's kids [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=591.84s)]

*  He did a lot of good in that world, but you get it 36 hours into a telethon, right? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=601.24s)]
*  You're you've been up 36 hours. Yeah, you're on QVC then that's like and I did there were times on QVC where it snowed and [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=606.2199999999999s)]
*  Like the the next ghost couldn't come in [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=614.56s)]
*  So when you're when you've been up for that long and you're on live TV and they bring you like a collectible doll [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=617.88s)]

*  Yeah, and so you're just sitting there like this doll would be next to me and her name would be Rachel [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=630.84s)]
*  And she'd be dressed up like a tramp from Little Women or something. Yeah, and you just give them stories, you know [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=637.12s)]

*  It was free associating over whatever they brought [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=662.4s)]
*  I wasn't a very good salesman, but I was good at like starting sentences with no clear end and just keep going [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=665.64s)]

*  Possibility she says no, but there's yes. Yes in those eyes and then the camera guy pushes in close really close [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=683.72s)]
*  Yeah, and I'm sitting here like this looking at a monitor looking at myself looking at the doll and a million people are watching [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=690.84s)]
*  She's new in town. She's new in town and she's keen to make some friends and there's really no telling how far she'll go [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=697.32s)]

*  Oh, I believe that and I'll tell you that that I'll tell you this that these beanie babies are stuffed with [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=744.4399999999999s)]

*  Because when you get it wet it swells up a little bit like those nesting dolls in reverse [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=762.48s)]
*  When you see that little princess die beanie babies swell up like a tick your heart's gonna beat with [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=766.96s)]

*  I thought that's worth knowing and if you order right now within the next 44 seconds [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=799.8s)]
*  Both of these CIA beanie babies will be stuffed with pure polyester or gay cotton as they call it in some circles [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=805.26s)]
*  That's right. And for this week just to mix things up a little bit each one of these beanie babies [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=812.02s)]

*  It's a hundred percent made in the USA and Slate magazine had just written a story [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=893.42s)]
*  Called the world's greatest hoodie. Hmm, so it wasn't cheap, but it was made from cotton that was [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=900.5s)]
*  Literally picked like outside of Gaffney maybe or Middlesex, South Carolina where their factories were [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=907.26s)]
*  He showed me pictures of the employees who stitched it you write the yarn that everything and I still have it [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=913.06s)]

*  American giant is still doing it like I mean [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=956.18s)]
*  Yeah, they're making clothes in America, right? Because this is yeah, how did I come across this? [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=959.3399999999999s)]
*  Oh a friend of mine showed this to me. They sent me a clip about a guy was trying to make a product in America [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=964.12s)]
*  Yeah, and he couldn't do it. I'll put it on for a few minutes. This is my [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=970.62s)]

*  1988 [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=985.1s)]

*  Um, the problem that those guys have is [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=997.54s)]
*  There's a labor challenge because what what's happening is they're competing [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1002.22s)]
*  Obviously with China with Vietnam and with a lot of other places and and those places, you know [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1007.86s)]
*  They don't have the same regulations. They don't have the same [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1013.82s)]
*  Requirements they don't have the same [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1019.94s)]
*  Conditions and factories all that stuff right? You don't have to be fully awake to work. You don't even have to really be [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1021.98s)]
*  Human. I'm not sure what the what the laws are. I just know that when the dust settles [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1028.4s)]
*  It's a it's a hell of a lot harder to do it here, so [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1033.68s)]
*  They do it they're trying to do it. They do it elsewhere [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1037.76s)]
*  Did they do it in South Carolina? They do it in South Carolina American Giant American Giant guys [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1040.72s)]
*  But it's it's crazy to think that when you think about [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1045.16s)]
*  This is a misconception that I started to realize that I had that when I traveled around [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1048.3200000000002s)]
*  the country because we've probably and I'll just said this recently, but we [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1053.2800000000002s)]

*  They go to 50 cities right sure and they go to the we've went as many places you as you could go and we [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1062.92s)]

*  Yeah, I mean just we to Fargo [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1077.0s)]
*  I mean we're going to medium-sized cities and you always think like oh well [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1080.0s)]
*  There's factories everywhere that make things and stuff like that. There's not no there's not and you you think oh well [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1084.3200000000002s)]

*  Products and sweatshirts it we're not [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1096.6000000000001s)]

*  Do they called the tents well? [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1106.32s)]
*  I mean it was you know there's so many rivers up there [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1108.32s)]
*  And so the mills were by the rivers and so the the factories were near the mills and the cotton was spun there [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1111.08s)]
*  But this guy Bayard he's actually become a friend of mine, and he's on a mission and [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1117.64s)]
*  like flannel like hand dyed yarn in [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1123.6s)]
*  Flannel was something like those old thick flannel shirts that we grew up with you can't get them anymore [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1128.84s)]
*  so American Giants started making those they started making these hoodies and [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1134.84s)]

*  Mm-hmm just because why not see the thing is man if Trump? [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1152.2s)]
*  succeeds at [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1157.8400000000001s)]
*  the reshoring effort [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1159.68s)]
*  tariffs yeah, that's part of it, but if in if in general he gets manufacturing [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1161.8400000000001s)]
*  reinvigorated in this country then [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1169.3600000000001s)]
*  There's gonna be a challenge that like a lot of people aren't talking about which which is labor right so there's in [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1171.9199999999998s)]
*  January there were [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1178.9199999999998s)]
*  482,000 open positions in [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1181.6399999999999s)]
*  manufacturing in this country right four hundred eighty thousand open positions if [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1185.0s)]
*  He gets his way and this all gets reinvigorated [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1190.56s)]
*  You're talking about two or three million new jobs, but there's [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1194.36s)]
*  There's no workforce sitting there going this is what I want to do or prepare to do it that they're not so there's a skills gap [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1199.48s)]
*  For sure okay, but there's also a will gap right okay? [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1205.76s)]
*  So let's talk about a couple of these things Mike so first let's talk about [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1210.8s)]
*  Because it is pretty warm in here, but I will say this feels great often that thing they made a teacher [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1215.04s)]
*  Oh, dude you will never this thing will keep your coffee warm for seven eons [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1219.56s)]
*  It gets it's I mean not to turn into a commercial, but I swear [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1223.64s)]
*  It's weird how soft it'll get yeah, it gets softer, and it gets thicker. It'll smell a little funky [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1226.8s)]
*  Oh God, it's gonna turn into a wife you can [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1232.48s)]
*  Spit my lip again hey um but no this is really awesome Mike and and I know you have a new show [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1236.36s)]
*  That's coming out in your YouTube on on May 2nd [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1242.26s)]
*  Where you went and met with a lot of just workers on the ground right? We do a lot of that [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1245.28s)]
*  But this this thing is kind of important this is a tariff stuff yeah, okay [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1250.52s)]
*  Let's so let's start there so Trump has put in a lot of he started this kind of tariff war right yeah [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1256.44s)]
*  And you hear people say it's good you people say that it's bad from my perspective after traveling on the country [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1262.32s)]
*  I don't know how else you're gonna get jobs back here because it just there's a lot of towns that are boarded up [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1268.04s)]
*  There's a lot of small cities that are boarded up [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1272.68s)]
*  I mean a whole city you walk through the city of Jackson, Mississippi [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1274.36s)]
*  During the day it looks like a movie set it's very clean [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1279.0s)]
*  It's beautiful, but there's nothing and that's one of 40 probably cities that we've seen there like that [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1283.98s)]
*  So I'm just thinking what's gonna come and save these cities if something needs to and so then you start to see Trump with [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1290.28s)]
*  These tariffs on and then you start to get the idea well [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1296.32s)]
*  It's to bring jobs back so we have jobs here, so it keeps cities busy [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1298.72s)]
*  Yeah, so so it's two different conversations. I think okay, and obviously [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1302.72s)]
*  I'm not an economist in fact either. I don't know an economist who thinks tariffs are a good idea [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1306.92s)]
*  I really don't I don't know an economist I [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1312.0s)]
*  Know a couple but the ones I'm most interested in are like slightly right of center [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1315.4s)]
*  Where they don't agree either right so like everybody is either having a conversation about whether or not. It's a good idea [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1321.4s)]
*  economically I [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1329.48s)]
*  Call that like a tier two conversation [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1331.04s)]
*  You're having a tier one conversation you're saying well wait a minute [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1333.36s)]
*  What if there's something in the country that's actually more important than the economy long term right? [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1336.96s)]
*  What if like what could that be the economy the human spirit? I think it could be that and [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1344.36s)]
*  You know I get I get all kinds of grief for this, but I think it's a fair analogy. I think about [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1349.6399999999999s)]
*  Well hell I think about slavery in 1870 [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1356.6s)]
*  Right and I think about the conversation that was going on in the country and a big part of it was wait [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1359.84s)]
*  If we get rid of this [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1365.56s)]
*  Do you have any idea what it's going to do to the economy not just for the south which would collapse but for the north [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1367.9599999999998s)]
*  Who was buying all the product was all dressed in cotton right and of course? [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1373.6s)]
*  There's the triangle trade molasses rum slaves right this this is an eternal wheel that had been going on for time in [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1377.0s)]
*  Memoriam yeah dark run where do you think that came from? [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1384.1999999999998s)]
*  You know I'm saying you put a couple you know [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1387.44s)]
*  I think I know what you're saying understand you mix a few items, and you got some that's the best rum [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1389.44s)]
*  They got it's good rum, but if you [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1394.96s)]
*  Fundamentally were to make the slavery decision [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1398.4s)]
*  Based on nothing, but whether or not it was good or bad for the economy well [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1401.56s)]
*  We'd still have slavery right so we got to a point where people said wait wait wait [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1406.4s)]
*  The this can't this can't keep going this isn't human. That's right, right, right? [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1411.64s)]
*  and so [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1416.32s)]
*  It was bad right the economy crapped the bed [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1418.6s)]
*  We fought a war a lot of people died, and I don't mean to sound glib when I say it [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1421.28s)]
*  I don't know what the real [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1426.96s)]
*  Ramifications are gonna be I don't have a crystal ball [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1430.4399999999998s)]
*  But I do think that the reason people are talking past each other with the tariffs is because some people are saying look it's a tax [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1433.0s)]
*  Period it's not good for global trade which is true [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1440.28s)]
*  But if there's this other if you're trying to transform Jackson, Mississippi [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1444.3200000000002s)]
*  then you at least have to elevate the the conversation to these this other set of consequences that might happen if you [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1448.92s)]
*  Shake the whole thing up right now. I [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1456.64s)]
*  Again, I put a big like asterix on that I I don't really know what I'm talking about [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1459.5200000000002s)]
*  but I do believe that they're [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1464.4s)]
*  unintended consequences and intended consequences and [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1467.7600000000002s)]
*  The consequences of messing with the tariffs [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1471.3999999999999s)]
*  Are are probably both right, but do you feel like do you think Trump his intentions are good? [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1475.24s)]
*  Here's what I think when I started my little foundation which by the way [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1484.56s)]
*  We're still doing it. We've got three million bucks. We're giving away this month in these work ethic scholarships, so we're we're training people [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1489.24s)]
*  For skilled jobs where we're training people for manufacturing jobs. We've been doing it for years [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1496.84s)]
*  That's me in a cap and gown sitting there without any pants on as if to indicate [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1501.8799999999999s)]
*  Optically that even though I have my degree. I'm not actually trained for any of the opportunities occur [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1506.72s)]
*  Oh, you'll think you just graduated from San Francisco. I'll say that nice legs. It was an experimental [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1511.6999999999998s)]
*  My dad used to wear those shoes, dude. Hey, you see my shark bite there on my left my left knee [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1517.52s)]
*  That's yeah, there you go. Look at that hurt. Yeah a lot of sharks over there in San Fran those bays buddy [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1523.34s)]
*  You know, so Trump's intentions, right? I don't know. I don't know the man [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1528.22s)]
*  I'm rooting for him. But here's what happened to me when I started that [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1532.4599999999998s)]
*  Foundation you started this. Yep, it was because your foundation gives out [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1536.54s)]
*  Work ethic scholarships work ethic scholarships and people can apply on the website if you click on scholarship right there up at the top [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1540.54s)]
*  yeah, it'll take you to a [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1548.22s)]
*  Well, that's me and a bunch of people who got this guy there you go, yeah, it's awesome [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1550.94s)]
*  Can we donate to that you can donate to it? Sure. Awesome, man [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1554.68s)]
*  Yeah, in fact, we just auctioned off these guys up in Ohio made me a truck [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1558.0s)]
*  They made a micro works work truck Rogan's head exploded when he saw this. Yeah, this is a [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1562.78s)]
*  1964 power wagon and they they [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1569.38s)]
*  Built it from scratch is beautiful and they took us to the Barrett Jackson auction and we got one and a half million bucks for it [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1573.34s)]
*  So that all went to scholarships. I [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1580.22s)]
*  Remember last time I was doing it way less than that [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1582.98s)]
*  I was auction off all kinds of crap from dirty jobs to raise money. We've given away about 12 million bucks in these [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1585.14s)]
*  That's amazing, but but I'm not saying it cuz I'm awesome [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1591.38s)]
*  No, you're just saying this is so this is a way that you're trying to be a part of the things that you've gone through [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1594.46s)]
*  And seen you want to put guys back in the workforce and make them be prepared [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1599.3s)]
*  Is that right? That is right [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1602.34s)]
*  And the answer to your question regarding Trump actually starts with Obama because the year we started this in [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1604.06s)]
*  2008 I [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1609.94s)]
*  don't know if you remember it but he had a thing called the highway infrastructure act and [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1611.3400000000001s)]
*  It was big news headlines everywhere. He was going to create three million shovel ready jobs, right and [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1616.38s)]
*  I was rooting for him and then dirty jobs at the time was at its absolute [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1624.3400000000001s)]
*  peak and [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1629.42s)]
*  What was weird as the country was going into a recession was everybody I was talking to on dirty jobs [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1631.5s)]
*  There are 12 million unemployed people but they all had like help wanted signs out. They were really struggling the higher and [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1637.54s)]
*  Their basic bitch was we just can't find people who were excited to pick up a shovel [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1644.82s)]
*  Hmm, we can't find people who want to do the work that we have so I reached out [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1650.22s)]
*  In an open letter to the to the president in 2009. It just said look man. I am rooting for you [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1656.18s)]
*  I think three million shovel ready jobs sounds great [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1662.68s)]
*  But part of making that succeed has to include a campaign to help [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1666.62s)]
*  Make shovel ready jobs cool because right now people aren't buying it. There it is. Look at that man [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1672.78s)]
*  You guys are unbelievable. That's an open letter to the president. Yeah 11 2009 [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1678.14s)]
*  I am awed by the task at hand and compelled to tell you about micro works a public awareness campaign designed to reinvigorate the traits [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1681.98s)]
*  Yeah, I we need there needs to be [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1688.78s)]
*  I'm saying I'm saying it because it's about to happen again, right Donald Trump is [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1692.02s)]
*  Going down a road and if he succeeds he's going to create [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1698.46s)]
*  millions of manufacturing jobs in a country that currently has [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1703.9s)]
*  nearly [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1709.02s)]
*  500,000 manufacturing jobs open [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1710.14s)]
*  Because the people who run those factories can't find people who want to do the work [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1713.22s)]
*  So it's not enough to create the jobs, right? [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1719.5800000000002s)]
*  And look a lot of your listeners are probably thinking well make the pay better make it more [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1723.2s)]
*  Make it more interesting make it more palatable and we can have that conversation for sure [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1728.9s)]
*  But the bigger issue still is there's no enthusiasm for the work. We took shop class out of high school [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1733.22s)]
*  We robbed kids of the opportunity even see what that kind of work even looks like [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1739.94s)]
*  Meanwhile we told a whole generation of kids [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1745.58s)]
*  They were can screwed if they didn't get a four-year degree, right? [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1748.02s)]
*  And so people say Mike how the how did college get so expensive? [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1753.28s)]
*  I know you know this but nothing has gotten more expensive in the last 40 years than a four-year degree [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1757.1s)]
*  Yeah, not not real estate not health care [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1762.6999999999998s)]

*  Open jobs right now most of which don't require four-year degree and here's the other screwed up part [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1786.4199999999998s)]
*  You got six point eight million able-bodied men who are not only not looking for work [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1792.3799999999999s)]

*  Well, I've got some thoughts on that [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1902.02s)]
*  so one is do you think that the college the one of the reasons it went up was because [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1903.4199999999998s)]
*  Most of that money was loans and then that was almost a scat not a scam but a scheme to scams good [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1907.8600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, Wow. Look, it's a product man. You're what what you're selling, right? [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1914.7s)]
*  But how does that money so just so I know so I'm clear so that money works because then [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1919.8600000000001s)]
*  The college loans it to you. They put interest on it and then you have to pay it back [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1924.98s)]
*  Well, the college doesn't loan it. Sometimes you might get a scholarship from the college. That's not a loan [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1928.66s)]
*  But financial aid packages can involve like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1933.58s)]
*  Yeah, which sounds like you're awesome aunt and uncle. So it also sounds like you borrowed some money from a guy in Memphis [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1938.58s)]
*  Well, actually what it is is some faceless bureaucrat and a tall soulless building in Kansas City [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1944.4199999999998s)]
*  That's just crunching the numbers, right? [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1951.5s)]
*  so so the more people they think it's you to college the more like [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1953.8999999999999s)]
*  The more interest that they can get off of these big loans, right? [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1957.2199999999998s)]
*  So sure the people loaning the money are getting interest on the loans, but it's the colleges themselves [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1960.1799999999998s)]
*  That like right now [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1967.2199999999998s)]
*  Literally as we speak there's a screaming headline [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1969.78s)]
*  Trump just put a hold on [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1973.34s)]
*  Two billion dollars of federal money that was gonna go straight to Harvard Harvard. Yeah, that's right [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1976.78s)]
*  Now, why would he do that? You know people are screaming. Oh my god, it's in it's something about free speech [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1982.3799999999999s)]
*  You know two point two billion dollars in grants to Harvard has been paused due to activism on campus [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1989.14s)]
*  Where in the headline does it tell you that Harvard has a 52 billion dollar endowment? Hmm nowhere, but they do [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=1996.94s)]
*  They've got over 50 billion dollars in an endowment. Yeah, that might not even have an effect [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2004.6200000000001s)]
*  Well, I mean look it's colleges, especially the top-tier colleges [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2010.54s)]
*  Have an awful lot of money and and they have a steady stream of customers because in our society [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2016.86s)]
*  We have completely bought into the notion that that what you're purchasing in these schools is an education [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2023.94s)]
*  Which you're actually purchasing is a credential right whether or not you're educated or not your experience may vary [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2031.3s)]
*  Look, dude, I'm looking at my iPhone right here [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2037.78s)]
*  If you've got an internet connection your you have well you have access to 98% of all the known information [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2040.6599999999999s)]
*  In the world right how you process it and how you use utilize it. That's up to you. Yeah, that's you [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2046.3s)]
*  So I'm not it's not fair to say that you can get a liberal arts degree on your iPhone, but you can [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2051.18s)]
*  It's not fair to really compare, you know [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2057.1s)]
*  Lying in your bed like I did two weeks ago watching a free lecture at MIT and saying, you know [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2060.38s)]
*  It would be the same experience if I were there in the classroom [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2066.7s)]
*  But it's close enough to say well, wait a minute if the first one cost me zero point zero dollars [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2070.06s)]
*  And the second one is gonna keep me in debt for over 20 years [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2076.3s)]
*  Right first. What am I doing? Yeah, so I don't know man [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2080.7400000000002s)]
*  I I feel badly about painting with too broad a brush my liberal arts degree served me really well. I [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2084.1800000000003s)]
*  Was I graduated four years after you were born. I'm guessing 1984. I graduated if we hear all right [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2091.02s)]
*  It's great here. I went to two years in a community college a hot chicks then too [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2098.34s)]

*  There's a parallel here. It's kind of what's going on right now. That's it people [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2195.12s)]
*  Like if you sing opera you shouldn't be in a sewer if you're in a sewer [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2199.32s)]

*  Well, the first time I had to take a pledge it was the pledge of the flag. Yeah [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2352.48s)]
*  I didn't really know what it meant. I was too young just memorized it right but later in the Boy Scouts [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2355.7799999999997s)]
*  You know, I had a Scout Master who was a retired army colonel [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2361.48s)]
*  He was a hard-ass and he took this really seriously [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2366.2s)]
*  so you like raise your hand and and and pledge you you take the Scout oath not only like 12 years old at the [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2369.88s)]
*  Time but I remember thinking this feels like there were candles lit in a darkened room and it was serious [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2377.84s)]
*  You know, it's as serious as could be it's it's easy to look back and laugh and poke fun [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2384.7000000000003s)]
*  But no we did the same thing it mattered man on my honor [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2389.0400000000004s)]
*  I will do my best to do my duty to God in my country [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2392.32s)]
*  Like wait, that's the first sentence never mind whether you like it or agree or disagree [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2395.96s)]
*  Challenging kids to to take an oath and to and to make a pledge my foundation has a thing called a sweat pledge [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2402.6s)]
*  You have to sign it if you're applying for the particular pile of money that I've accumulated through [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2409.88s)]
*  Donations and I'm super stingy with that money. Well, AA has a they have a pledge in the beginning that you do as a group [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2415.52s)]
*  There's something about doing something as a group that makes you feel a part of a group. That's how a group works [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2421.12s)]
*  it's how tradition happens, right you can't just have it without actually participating in it and [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2425.12s)]
*  And vowing to it you you you must assume individual responsibility [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2430.6000000000004s)]
*  But you must do that in the presence of other like-minded people. Yeah, so my sweat pledge [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2435.6400000000003s)]
*  Which I ironically wrote after some bourbon stands for skill and work ethic aren't taboo [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2441.48s)]
*  I was just looking for a way to make people make a promise and you can find it out here [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2447.1400000000003s)]
*  It's it's now a curriculum actually in 70 schools, but it's based on the 12-step recovery process [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2452.1200000000003s)]
*  and [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2458.9s)]
*  the Boy Scout law [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2460.1400000000003s)]
*  mmm trustworthy loyal helpful friendly courteous kind obedient cheerful thrifty brave clean and reverent combined with these really [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2461.6400000000003s)]
*  old-school [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2470.1400000000003s)]
*  Affirmations around things like gratitude and delayed gratification and [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2473.9s)]
*  personal responsibility and and work ethic and an aversion to debt [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2479.06s)]
*  I actually have something on the sweat pledge that says [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2483.6400000000003s)]
*  I would rather live in a tent and eat beans [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2487.02s)]
*  Then pay for things I can't afford now people call me their piss their parents call right there [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2490.38s)]
*  there's there's a tenant on the pledge that says I I [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2496.7s)]
*  Believe that my safety is my responsibility [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2500.58s)]
*  mmm, I [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2503.34s)]
*  Understand that just because I'm in compliance doesn't mean I'm out of danger [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2505.22s)]
*  Now I believe this because I nearly got killed half a dozen times on dirty jobs. There is number six, right? [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2510.58s)]
*  So yeah, so this thing makes people crazy it they [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2516.14s)]
*  They they resist it but this is a code really here it's it's my code [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2523.8199999999997s)]
*  It's your code and it starts right at the top man. I believe I've won the greatest lottery of all time [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2528.7s)]
*  I'm alive. I'll walk the earth. I live in America above all things. I'm grateful Wow now [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2534.2599999999998s)]
*  You can disagree with that and we can still be friends [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2540.4s)]
*  But when I get calls from from parents or teachers or kids who are going through this application process and they say look [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2543.72s)]
*  I'm not really comfortable signing this [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2551.16s)]
*  Then I say well then this particular pile of free money might not be for you. Yeah, it's okay, man [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2553.2799999999997s)]
*  I mean I work really hard and I raise a lot of money and I give a lot of it away and [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2558.2s)]
*  I make no apology for wanting to to help people who at least [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2562.24s)]
*  See the the world the same way you do or something adjacent. Oh, I agree [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2568.38s)]
*  I think that that makes perfect sense what but but you can't like you can't run a business that way [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2573.1400000000003s)]
*  No, like you can't hire people based on their [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2577.54s)]
*  worldview regarding gratitude or personal responsibility at least not in California [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2582.26s)]
*  Yeah, probably not in California you can't but I think just you know, you can't you got to keep it off the documents [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2586.42s)]
*  But secretly in your head you can low-key have such wink wink [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2590.86s)]
*  Do you think there's something different about the Gen Z workforce or do you think there's just they haven't had the same examples that previous [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2594.46s)]
*  Generations had you know, yeah, I do I think [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2601.42s)]

*  And you know, I we're not pointing the Gen Z workforce like you're bad or anything like that because you know, it's so funny [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2608.62s)]
*  It's like we had a guy on recently [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2614.06s)]
*  This guy Alexander Wang and he's not the fashion guy. They got murdered is a China is a [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2616.9s)]
*  It's like kind of a semi Chinese guy, but he found it scale AI it's an AI company and he was saying that [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2622.34s)]
*  One way to look at AI is that everyone one will kind of level up, right? [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2629.14s)]
*  It's like suddenly a kind of robots or computers will do a lot of the more menial tasks [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2634.18s)]
*  Yeah, and you'll everyone will kind of be a manager and it's interesting because if you say that to [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2640.5s)]
*  Me or your generation our generation kind of that people would be like [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2646.58s)]
*  Well, I don't want to just be I don't want to be the manager of five robots [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2651.4s)]
*  And I sit in a small dark room all the time and and you know [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2655.16s)]
*  And that's my life and maybe I get four day work week instead of five. Yeah, but if you told my nephews [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2658.52s)]
*  That hey you get to be the manager of five robots you just sit in this room and control them all day [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2666.4s)]
*  They would think that's awesome. Just because of how they've grown up, you know, like everything is so gamified [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2671.96s)]
*  So it's kind of interesting because you start to get into what the whole like [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2678.5600000000004s)]
*  perception of work of [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2684.0s)]
*  Being alive even is to people does that make any sense to you? It makes look it starts [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2686.6000000000004s)]
*  I mean a lot in there there's a lot but what you're really saying is like what is a good job? [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2691.8s)]
*  What is a bad job? What is a clean job? [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2697.6800000000003s)]
*  What is a dirty job and and once you start to create some sort of hierarchy which makes sense? [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2699.92s)]
*  Everybody's free to do it. You ought to do it. But you know if Bayard were here the American giant guy [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2705.7599999999998s)]
*  He would he would tell you a story about [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2711.48s)]
*  The individuals who made that sweatshirt, right? He would he would show you the factory line [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2714.7599999999998s)]
*  He would introduce you to the farmers who grew the cotton [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2721.24s)]
*  He would show you step by step how his entire supply chain is insulated from these tariffs [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2724.04s)]
*  These tariffs hadn't affected him at all because he he doesn't he doesn't rely on any of right [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2730.0s)]
*  He's totally independent. So he's taken kind of a victory lap right now, but his big point would be [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2735.08s)]
*  You would have to see the enthusiasm [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2741.36s)]
*  among his group of workers when they created a sweatshirt that became the greatest hoodie ever made and [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2745.12s)]
*  You can look at that and go it's a frickin sweatshirt dude, but it's not a sweatshirt, right? [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2753.6s)]
*  It's not that it's not about the sweatshirt and this might put it into even better focus [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2758.7599999999998s)]

*  Right now is impacting our submarine base [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2987.28s)]
*  You I think you can draw a line between [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2992.08s)]
*  the enthusiasm of the workers who build one of these subs and believe me you should meet these guys they're like they [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=2995.68s)]

*  It's a big deal you can compare not not the work [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3009.66s)]
*  But the feeling to the satisfaction that comes from making the greatest sweatshirt in the world [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3013.2200000000003s)]
*  And if you can do that you can do it for virtually every product in between [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3018.1s)]
*  That's what I'm talking about. Right? There's some somehow or another and I started talking about this early on in dirty jobs [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3024.02s)]
*  It just it just became clear that in our society [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3031.74s)]
*  We had identified work as the enemy [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3036.22s)]
*  It's like the the proximate cause of all our misery is the fact that our freakin boss is up our ass and every day [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3040.02s)]

*  That I have to do whatever it is. I have to do until I get to the point where I can retire [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3061.06s)]

*  Okay, a whittle it could be a thing that you whittle but a whittle flunk is the actual tool [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3121.98s)]
*  Okay question and and and you can Google that now you won't find anything to confirm any of it [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3128.8999999999996s)]
*  I just felt like it was my turn to talk again. Oh, that's very fair [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3134.6s)]
*  I'm gonna say this [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3137.8599999999997s)]
*  You know what you're right and I think that that used to be a part of kind of what you were saying even in school [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3138.8999999999996s)]
*  I pledge allegiance to my country this country means something to me like my grandfather worked at this factory where they made [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3144.14s)]
*  Parts it was for FMC writing and made like elevator parts for elevator shafts and stuff like that [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3151.54s)]
*  Yeah, but he would go to the factory and it was like this thing and then we were in elevators [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3156.18s)]
*  We would see his little emblem on the thing. He's like, oh grandpa made this, you know [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3160.06s)]
*  So that and that kind of stuff was huge [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3163.4s)]
*  It was that it was like even like native like in cultures. There are stories that you tell your grandkids [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3166.02s)]
*  It's like like the meaning of being human we passed from each other we passed it in like relics and in [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3172.2s)]
*  Artifacts and you know, you keep things from people that meant meant something to you [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3179.92s)]
*  So I think to think that that just because that only happens [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3184.6s)]
*  It doesn't only happen like in your family if your grandfather passes away and you keep something that meant something to him [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3187.3999999999996s)]
*  But it happens as a community too [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3192.48s)]
*  It's like you have things that mean something to you and that carry on one of my does that make any sense of my rambling? [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3194.24s)]
*  Okay, no, dude. I'm telling you. Yeah, what the fuck you talking? Of course it makes sense, dude [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3200.44s)]
*  Yeah, it makes you feel alive dude, you know, it makes you feel alive [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3204.36s)]
*  And then like you see something across town [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3209.08s)]
*  You're like man, I was a part of that you get to drive by and tell your son [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3210.92s)]
*  I built that house and your son's like no way. I want to learn how to build something [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3214.28s)]
*  You know, why do you think people lost their shit when Obama said you didn't build that you didn't do that [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3218.2400000000002s)]
*  We all did that together. It was it was an insult to [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3223.96s)]
*  What you're saying that part of us it doesn't mean that we're not all part of a of a team a country a concerted effort [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3228.92s)]
*  But it does mean like if you if you rob an individual of that feeling [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3235.96s)]
*  Then you have reduced his work to only the transactional companies [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3241.56s)]
*  It's just a paycheck now, right? But I'm telling you my life changed [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3247.2s)]
*  It was early on in dirty jobs and we and we weren't even really filming yet [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3251.2s)]
*  Or it was it was after we shot and I was I was working with a mason and [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3256.12s)]

*  And as we're driving he was like pointing up to the facade. He goes. Yeah, we did that one and then around the corner [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3278.94s)]

*  His eyes were filling up. Mm-hmm, and he was he was driving past [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3291.32s)]
*  his life's work and it was there on display to be seen and [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3297.0s)]

*  Then I'm gonna talk about your new show [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3592.1s)]
*  Last time we spoke we talked about minimum wage, right? [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3594.3799999999997s)]
*  Last time we spoke I said there was no justice if you didn't put spunk minions on a hat [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3597.46s)]
*  I told you a story of artificial insemination [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3603.52s)]
*  You coined that term at least I'd never heard it before [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3607.54s)]
*  The coffee came out of my nose and I said for for god's sakes man, please hot coffee came [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3610.68s)]
*  It was still hot hot coffee cooled down with some of this [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3616.8199999999997s)]
*  You know poison but yeah. Yeah, I remember last time I was it was that conversation. I I'm not blowing sunshine, dude [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3620.66s)]
*  I got more people [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3628.46s)]
*  More more of the people that I that my foundation tries to reach [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3630.22s)]
*  Reached out to me. Really? Yep to say I heard you on Theo von and I would like to apply for a scholarship [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3634.66s)]
*  What do I do? Wow, I mean, that's awesome [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3640.5s)]
*  No, you you you need to understand I'm sure you understand but it was I do this all the time [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3643.04s)]
*  hundreds of people [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3648.2s)]
*  Hundreds of people because the problem is man, I I preach to the choir a lot, you know [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3650.08s)]
*  I talked to people who already you know, I your [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3655.92s)]
*  Your audience is the future of this country a big chunk of them are anyway [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3658.84s)]
*  I don't know about the others [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3663.04s)]
*  Well, I do believe that one thing I think I have in common with a lot of my audience is that the way that we feel [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3664.04s)]
*  About stuff, right? Yeah might have different views on things [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3669.04s)]
*  But I think our feelings are a lot the same and we talk a lot about like purpose on here [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3672.08s)]
*  Like we had a guy named John Verveke come on and talk about purpose we had [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3677.28s)]
*  Richard Reeves, it's really great. He talks about how men aren't leaders in their communities anymore, you know, they're not doing Boy Scout troops [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3682.2000000000003s)]
*  They're not teaching in classes anymore. So we're losing this male-to-male connection piece that is part of what keeps our desire to be like [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3689.52s)]
*  performing humans human males, you know, like [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3698.12s)]
*  So we talk about this kind of stuff a lot [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3701.28s)]
*  And maybe there's a way we can figure out something to do where we could you know [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3703.8s)]
*  I can we would love to donate and then just continue to help send people your direction. Well, look man, I [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3707.28s)]
*  I'll never say no to a couple bucks, but I don't need it. What what I need is what you're doing [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3712.84s)]
*  Right. I mean what I need is for the people listening to like if they're if they're [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3717.44s)]
*  Serious about what you just framed the book to read is called men without work. It's by a guy called Nick Eberstadt [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3722.7200000000003s)]
*  He is a real economist and I know him [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3729.88s)]
*  And he wrote this thing years ago, but republished it during the lockdowns and that's where [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3732.36s)]
*  That's where the real truth of this is man. That's where the story [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3740.0s)]
*  That's the real story Theo at the time he republished this there were seven point two million able-bodied men [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3743.12s)]
*  Not only not working but not looking no now the question is well, what the hell are they doing? Right, right [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3750.88s)]
*  The research goes deep and wide and it's horrifying by and large [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3757.44s)]
*  The majority of them are spending two thousand hours a year on their screens. Mm-hmm. They're scrolling [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3762.6s)]
*  they're looking they're they're they're inward right and [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3769.32s)]
*  And what that means is they're not in the JCs or the Kiwanis Club or the Boy Scouts or the Alliance Club [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3774.08s)]
*  Or the YMCA right? They're not in their local church. They're not volunteering in their community [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3781.36s)]
*  They're not doing anything at all except living some version of what was it thorough? [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3786.2s)]
*  lives of quiet desperation [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3793.2s)]
*  Yeah, and that's and I want to tell you one other thing too that really blew me away [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3795.2s)]
*  I I knew of you I didn't know you and it's cool that you texted me and stayed in touch over the last two years [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3800.8399999999997s)]
*  Since we talked. Oh, thanks, man. No, no, it's it [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3807.2s)]
*  it's most people don't do that really yeah, they don't and [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3810.4399999999996s)]
*  And [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3814.7599999999998s)]
*  It's so much fun talking to you that you know, I took a deeper dive and one night [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3816.0s)]
*  Just was scrolling through and I watched you sit here or maybe you were in Nashville. I don't know [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3822.04s)]
*  But but somebody called in and they told you a story and it was a common story [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3828.4s)]
*  but it was a sad story and it was a combination of addiction and [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3834.16s)]
*  And struggling with that and a kind of hopelessness and and this kind of desperation that my friend Nick writes about you know [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3839.2000000000003s)]
*  And what you did? [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3846.7200000000003s)]
*  You did two things that were [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3848.96s)]
*  Really interesting to me [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3852.08s)]
*  The first thing is you sat and didn't say a word [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3853.92s)]
*  I've never seen I've never seen anybody do that before you just sat [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3858.2000000000003s)]
*  And looked at the camera like you're looking at me like you actually listened [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3863.6s)]
*  And then you talked for about three minutes and about the most empathetic way I had ever seen I [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3867.56s)]
*  took that clip [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3874.12s)]
*  And I sent it to my little network and I said look man the [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3875.7599999999998s)]
*  This war is going to be fought on a lot of fronts. It's a war of [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3880.7599999999998s)]
*  public opinion to your point it's it's a [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3885.0s)]
*  It's it's persuasion. It's all these things but what this guy is doing right now in this space in this way [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3888.44s)]
*  Is important so? [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3896.8s)]
*  Yeah, man, I don't know how big you're gonna get and I don't know how wide your audience is gonna be [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3899.6000000000004s)]
*  but the fact that it's as big as it is I [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3905.36s)]
*  Yeah, you're funny. You're funny as hell. I [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3909.04s)]
*  was gonna crash one of your shows and [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3912.56s)]
*  Forget what town I was in but it was like what is it the rat the rat was back or return of the rat [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3915.76s)]
*  Yeah, that's the thing you can't keep a rat down you could kill a rat BAM another rat boy [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3921.48s)]
*  You know up to keep popping up, but that's who we are you're resilient [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3926.28s)]
*  We're resilient, and that's you know I mean Louisiana doesn't have a lock on that, but I'll tell you what man you're [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3930.6s)]
*  Dirty jobs [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3937.84s)]
*  Louisiana's very good to dirty jobs. I mean from Baton Rouge to Lafayette to cut off [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3939.48s)]
*  I did my time there we should have been cut off when we stayed on dude. That's Louisiana [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3943.36s)]
*  Louisiana purchase first of all thank you very fucking much you would even have a third of this country for isn't for Louisiana Thomas Jefferson [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3948.64s)]

*  Yeah [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3968.3599999999997s)]
*  I think that's the one thing that connects our audience is just there's this way that we feel and a lot of it is [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3968.64s)]
*  Hopeful right and so that's the side that I choose to err on when it comes to the tariff stuff [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3973.8s)]
*  It's like I have no clue like if it doesn't work. What the fuck. What do we lose? [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3978.1200000000003s)]
*  we're at a we are I believe that we are at a [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3983.5600000000004s)]
*  severe crossing point right now [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3987.36s)]
*  where if it gets an if [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3989.88s)]
*  Another generation without like a sense of purpose it's it's not gonna matter nothing nothing's gonna matter anymore [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3992.44s)]
*  There won't even be enough of a person inside of our grandchildren [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=3998.1600000000003s)]
*  For it to matter to like even if you bring the gasoline there's not gonna be enough of a [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4001.68s)]
*  Amp inside of them even spark it up [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4006.2s)]
*  It's like even I think the human spirit is a muscle right about that's how I feel about it [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4008.2s)]
*  and I feel like it's always there, but it's like the stronger that we work it and the more that we [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4012.56s)]
*  Encourage others to work it, you know [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4017.7999999999997s)]
*  And it's scary man. It I think people don't realize it's scary [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4020.48s)]
*  But then I think part of all of us realize it's something scary is going on. Well, the stakes are big, right? [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4024.96s)]
*  I mean thirty seven trillion dollars in national that that's the national debt. Yeah, thirty seven trillion [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4029.48s)]
*  Most people like you really don't have to be an economist. You don't have to be you don't need a pedigree to understand [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4036.0s)]
*  That that's getting a little wobbly and yeah, and it's not sustainable. So something radical has to happen [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4043.64s)]
*  Something really unpopular is going to have to have right and it's gonna be uncomfortable [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4050.8s)]
*  It's gonna be uncomfortable gonna be wildly uncomfortable, but what's gonna be way more uncomfortable is [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4055.12s)]
*  Whatever's after that sounds it doesn't even sound human to me after that. I go back to the slavery thing [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4061.16s)]
*  I mean the idea of getting rid of that in [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4066.96s)]
*  1860 right it was [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4073.44s)]
*  So many otherwise rational people who were walking around [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4076.08s)]
*  Influencers of the day with columns and and people giving oratories and speeches really smart people were saying [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4081.8s)]
*  We can't do this. The country will collapse and other people were like well [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4089.52s)]
*  Then let the heavens fall because that's a hill I'll die on [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4096.0s)]
*  Right. Yeah, so every now and then [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4100.28s)]
*  something [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4103.64s)]
*  Rises to a place where you you you just can't talk about it the way you'd been talking about it, right? [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4104.76s)]
*  And look man, I really wonder 150 years from now [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4111.6s)]
*  What our great great great great grandkids will be saying about us like how right? [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4115.92s)]
*  What will be the slavery of today? [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4121.72s)]
*  Will it be the fact that we let our country become completely? [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4124.320000000001s)]
*  Dependent on other countries who really don't like us much [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4129.280000000001s)]
*  What I mean, I don't have any care it's it's in it's insane China. I interviewed a guy [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4133.66s)]
*  Yesterday who you would love Yanya Kellick. He's called he writes for the Epoch Times [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4140.38s)]
*  He's a senior editor over there. Okay, and he has been on China hard for 20 years and [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4145.54s)]
*  He believes one of the greatest untold stories right now is the fact that 60 [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4153.3s)]
*  to a hundred thousand [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4159.3s)]

*  Covered with timber now our forests are rotting and they're burning because we're not tending to them [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4422.18s)]
*  Meanwhile guess who the leading importer of timber is in the world China us. Oh [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4429.1s)]
*  We're the leading importer of it, but we have a great we have more than anybody and we're the leading import, California [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4435.540000000001s)]
*  Has so much timber and they import 80% of of what they need [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4442.620000000001s)]
*  How much energy are we sitting on right right? [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4448.06s)]

*  it's a but it's a weird combination of virtue signaling and [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4456.5s)]
*  And and and head in the sand well and also I think our media is probably a lot of it has been under control of [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4460.58s)]
*  people who don't want to [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4466.139999999999s)]
*  Champion America, maybe you know, I don't know if that's true or if it's just the fads and the way that things have gone [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4469.86s)]
*  But our yeah, it's just it's always it seemed like things have gotten like [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4475.7s)]
*  Anti-american somehow in the past even ten years like the American flag even became like kind of a right-wing symbol as opposed to the symbol [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4480.099999999999s)]
*  Our country and whoever's straight people think that things just happen [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4487.26s)]
*  I believe that there's strategy behind a lot of stuff that's out there [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4490.26s)]
*  I want to switch to a topic of so we but we talked before about minimum wage [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4493.06s)]
*  I don't think people can survive on minimum wages these days [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4497.88s)]
*  I just don't think that they can do it and I and Bernie Sanders talked about how well if a company makes more money [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4500.58s)]
*  Because they start using AI or for whatever reason that shouldn't that minimum wage go up within that company for the workers [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4507.18s)]
*  You know, what do you think? I think we have to do something if somebody makes $8 an hour and they work for eight hours [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4514.64s)]
*  That's $64. You can buy food for your family for that day these days. Yeah with that. Well, look, I mean I've it's a [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4522.46s)]
*  There are a lot of thoughts on that and I know there's not one perfect answer [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4530.0s)]
*  There's not but you can learn I think I mean you have to understand that [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4533.96s)]
*  Those jobs [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4539.68s)]
*  Minimum wage jobs were never designed to be careers, right? [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4541.16s)]
*  They're their rungs on a ladder, but for some people they are careers though, but [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4545.16s)]
*  But the majority that conversation next [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4550.24s)]
*  Okay [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4552.72s)]
*  But but but like the first thing to understand is you don't like the purpose of work is not to merely make money [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4553.08s)]
*  It's probably the biggest reason you've got to put food on the table [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4561.04s)]
*  I get all of that but you don't go from a kid into a fully actualized mature working person [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4564.88s)]
*  you you have to go through all kinds of [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4572.2s)]
*  like a crucible of fits and starts and good jobs and jobs that make sense and [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4575.0s)]
*  You know whether it's fast food or whether it's maybe digging a ditch or maybe putting siding on a house one hot summer, right? [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4580.4400000000005s)]
*  It's like these jobs [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4587.2s)]
*  That don't pay very well [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4589.28s)]
*  Offer something else that's really really really important to a person who is [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4592.52s)]
*  Maturing and and and growing I know what it is [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4599.320000000001s)]
*  I bet say they offer you the time to think and plan and strategize and get excited for something that you want to do [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4602.16s)]
*  It's almost like a soil that you get to be in for a little bit. It's like a buffet. Remember that now [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4609.42s)]
*  It's a buffet man. You you don't [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4613.84s)]
*  You're not gonna eat all of it yeah, it's not all gonna taste good to you [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4616.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, you you have to experience a whole long list of shit and and and most of it [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4621.66s)]
*  It's gonna leave a funny taste in your mouth [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4628.56s)]
*  Most things aren't for most people. It's a giant process of [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4631.76s)]
*  Figuring it all out and in the and also learning who you are now [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4637.360000000001s)]
*  I get it that doesn't address the fact that somebody busting their ass [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4641.18s)]
*  With inflation being wherever it is and the cost of goods being wherever that is [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4645.52s)]
*  Can't afford to feed their family on that salary now the other side is gonna say yeah, why'd you have a family? [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4649.88s)]
*  What are you doing? What do you why would you have a family before you have the means to provide for them? [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4655.360000000001s)]
*  And then we're gonna have that whole [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4660.0s)]
*  Conversation and it's and it's gonna get politicized [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4662.120000000001s)]
*  But if the basic argument is wait a second the people at the top of this company are being [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4664.68s)]
*  Unfairly enriched at the expense of the work I [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4671.24s)]
*  Totally get that right I totally get it and I'll tell you something that gives me hope all right because I get [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4675.719999999999s)]
*  Thank you. Yeah, we get stuck in the doldrums sometimes we get stuck in the ditch, and we don't look for the light [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4681.919999999999s)]
*  I'm gonna give you the light [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4687.0s)]
*  At least a couple beams of it the the doldrums and and the problem [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4689.12s)]
*  Almost always happens because it's door number one or door number two everything is binary [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4695.44s)]
*  So in this conversation, it's well are you union or are you management? [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4700.28s)]
*  Are you labor or are you management and like people have to choose? [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4706.04s)]
*  And now it's easy to forget that these are two sides of the same coin because we always pit them against one another and then [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4710.72s)]
*  People wind up in interviews like this or any one of a thousand other conversations [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4718.0s)]
*  And they're gonna get tagged as one of the other so [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4722.4s)]
*  my hope is [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4726.84s)]
*  in an organization called [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4728.84s)]
*  opportunity works and I [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4732.68s)]
*  Learned about these guys pretty recently, but two years ago a company called groundworks who you'll love [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4735.28s)]
*  Hired me to give a speech in Virginia Beach when their CEO [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4743.56s)]
*  Turned fifty five hundred of their frontline workers into owners [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4748.96s)]
*  Okay, so so here's what groundworks does [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4753.92s)]
*  Groundworks will fix the foundation on your house. They will encapsulate across space [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4757.88s)]
*  and they will [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4765.08s)]
*  Waterproof your basement. I was hoping you say hide your stepmother down there. That's okay. Well, that's an upsell [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4767.64s)]
*  But they'll do I mean look, you mean you gotta know who to talk to but but they like if you scroll through that [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4772.8s)]

*  They spend their life doing [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4798.6s)]
*  Backbreaking work they were made owners. It's like an esop plan and it goes all the way down [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4801.400000000001s)]
*  All the way through the company Wow, and it's another one of those moments Theo [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4807.12s)]
*  I'm sitting backstage and I'm watching these guys are there with their families and [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4811.4s)]

*  Barbarians at the gate, you know the whole Nabisco did like that world of private equity gets a really bad rap [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4857.04s)]
*  And in some cases I think probably deservedly I don't know about them. Well, it's a that's okay [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4864.679999999999s)]
*  It it's a deep dive, but it's like when you think when people talk about roll-ups [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4870.36s)]
*  What they're talking about about that either. Okay, let's say you've got a heating and air conditioning company [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4875.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah plumbing company electric company. Let's say you've had it for 25 years and let's say you you'd like to retire [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4880.96s)]
*  but but you really can't and you got 30 employees and you love them and [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4887.4s)]
*  It's their job and so forth and so on so the industry [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4892.0s)]
*  Consolidates when private equity comes and it says wait a second. We'll buy you. Okay, we're gonna make you more efficient [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4897.52s)]
*  We're gonna put you under somebody some other name [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4904.360000000001s)]
*  Okay, and and and you'll be able to retire because you've worked hard and your people will well [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4907.2s)]
*  You know, we're gonna do in some cases. It's it's it's good for the workers and other cases [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4914.56s)]
*  It's not so good because in the name of efficiency you can gut a company, right? [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4919.16s)]
*  So that's the the negative rap on private equity has has been that but now what's starting to happen at least in these home [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4923.28s)]

*  work with management to make [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4951.56s)]
*  everybody in the company and owner and [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4954.4800000000005s)]

*  But the research is incredible over time. What happens is these companies [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4963.6s)]

*  Or would you like the owner of the company to come out and fix your problem? [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4995.48s)]
*  It [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=4999.799999999999s)]
*  Changes everything and I've seen like you guys should take a deep dive if you want, but look at some of these [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=5000.92s)]

*  They leave this gathering with a check for four or five six hundred thousand dollars changes [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=5030.52s)]
*  That's a that's a financial event in their life and and it changes the way you think about that sweatshirt [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=5035.320000000001s)]

*  Yeah, sex and pornography addiction. Like that's one of the biggest epidemics that's coming right now is pornography addiction, right? [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=5069.04s)]

*  Okay, I could keep going on that but [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=5098.46s)]
*  But yeah, it's like you have to fight fire with fire and you have to fight it with more [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=5101.0599999999995s)]

*  This circle that we've been in of just like profiteering [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=5130.58s)]
*  and of like combining everything everything's just like it like these um [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=5135.22s)]
*  What do they call when they all get together, but it's one owner or whatever [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=5140.740000000001s)]

*  Because a lot of the stories that I heard this is I just thought about this [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=5147.700000000001s)]

*  They didn't get you know [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=5174.9s)]
*  And I think a lot of that happened because like you're saying umbrella companies came in things got consolidated [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=5175.66s)]
*  I mean we're meeting with Mark Zuckerberg and they're like up against antitrust stuff right now [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=5181.34s)]

*  Oh, yeah, but you know once I realized that all the shows I work on could be programmed [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=5238.9400000000005s)]
*  basically [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=5245.42s)]
*  By the people who watch them [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=5246.5s)]

*  Mark [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=5276.12s)]
*  invites me down to [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=5277.36s)]
*  Facebook and [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=5279.96s)]
*  He talks about [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=5281.4s)]
*  this thing called watch [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=5283.2s)]
*  Facebook watch and the thought was who are we gonna be? [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=5285.5199999999995s)]
*  You know ten years from now and who are we really gonna compete with and how is that gonna work? [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=5290.16s)]
*  And could we be Netflix should we be a kind of Netflix? So [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=5294.679999999999s)]
*  That company basically committed to spending [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=5299.759999999999s)]
*  Close to a billion dollars to answer that question [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=5303.08s)]
*  So how do you figure it out you green light a couple of shows and they did something called ball in the family some famous [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=5306.5199999999995s)]
*  Basketball player they did something with Jada Pinkett Smith and they did something with me [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=5314.2s)]
*  What they did with me was a show called returning the favor [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=5319.16s)]
*  Returning the favor. I think you would dig it [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=5322.599999999999s)]
*  basically I would look for and [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=5326.08s)]
*  Facebook would [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=5328.5599999999995s)]
*  Tell me about people in these little towns that you probably couldn't find on a map [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=5329.68s)]
*  That we're doing something [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=5335.6s)]
*  Super cool in their neighborhood and I've been in a totally selfless way [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=5337.68s)]
*  So it's like bloody do-gooders running a muck, right? [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=5341.76s)]
*  And so we would go in there and we'd meet these people and we would tell them like I'm not there at this point [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=5345.16s)]
*  I would send the crew in and they'd say hey, we're working on a documentary about your town [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=5352.280000000001s)]
*  We understand you're doing some good work maybe with foster care maybe with PTSD, right and [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=5356.6s)]

*  If you're gonna talk about it up there [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=5983.88s)]
*  You can't just look at Walmart as the devil because you've been told [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=5985.32s)]
*  They're the devil and you can't look at American giant as a small scrappy [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=5989.48s)]
*  US company that makes things that are too expensive [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=5993.88s)]
*  Because they're doing the best they can with the way the tables been set [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=5997.08s)]
*  but if you get these two guys together and [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6000.28s)]
*  All of a sudden you get a different kind of investment in a supply chain in our country in a different way [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6002.48s)]
*  And that's how a t-shirt can be made in this country for a price most people can't afford and that's a story [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6009.0s)]
*  That look that can happen with knives that can that can happen with anything anything [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6016.36s)]
*  Imagine like a QVC type of thing right where it's like this is American made and it's awesome, right? [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6021.2s)]
*  You would like make sure that the products were good and that they had enough of a supply chain where they could sell or maybe [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6025.48s)]
*  They can only make 50 this month [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6030.12s)]
*  But that's what they are and then they're limited and then you have like something that's a real person made it and then when you're [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6031.679999999999s)]
*  Walking around with something on your back [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6036.36s)]
*  This is like you're not just carrying of you don't you don't just have a shirt on your back that makes you look cool [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6037.799999999999s)]
*  You have somebody's well-being and their purpose on your back, you know, and so now you're carrying something together [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6042.4s)]
*  You know once you're both carrying purpose it takes a lot of its pressure if it's just you [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6049.719999999999s)]
*  But if you put the same weight on two people that's purpose man. Well, look man, that's that that's rod-busting 101 [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6054.42s)]
*  Look what you just did. I think you're full on metaphor there [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6060.0s)]
*  Like that's I did a job a couple years ago with these rodbusters their ironworkers, right and they and they carry [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6063.2s)]
*  The rebar right so you got a chunk of rebar say it's like I don't know whatever the gauge is [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6071.24s)]
*  It's thick these things weigh a couple hundred pounds and you get like eight of them [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6077.1s)]
*  So you get 800 pounds on? [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6080.42s)]
*  Eight guys shoulders and that's the only way you can move them [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6082.72s)]
*  You know, you have to put the weight on your shoulder where it gets crazy is well that guy's short [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6086.82s)]
*  And that guy's six three now if you're six three you're screwed. Yeah, you're doing a lot of yeah, right [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6091.88s)]
*  So it's like the whole it's really a great metaphor because when you're humping the iron up to the top of the skyscraper [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6097.68s)]
*  You're stepping through a grid of rebar that's already been laid and if you trip and you go down you take everybody with you [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6103.28s)]
*  So it's an incredible [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6110.92s)]
*  metaphor for [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6112.96s)]
*  teamwork [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6114.24s)]
*  consequences stakes [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6115.7s)]
*  Working together right and and to your point [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6117.8s)]
*  There there are there are other ways to get the rebar to where you need to [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6120.72s)]
*  To set it but this is the best way and it and it really does take a different way to think [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6126.240000000001s)]
*  And then ironically, of course, hey, have you ever seen a bridge? [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6132.56s)]
*  Before they pour the concrete where it's the whole thing is just like a skeleton of steel [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6137.04s)]
*  It's sounds very nice. It's well, it's it's beautiful and it's artistic and it's like what you're talking about before the [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6142.68s)]
*  There it is. That's like a whole panel of rebar there, right? [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6149.92s)]
*  Oh, yeah, and that's just on the floor. But when you see like an overpass being built [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6153.4400000000005s)]
*  It's like some kind of a dinosaur and it's all done with hundreds of tons of [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6160.160000000001s)]
*  Iron and like the guys who do this work [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6166.8s)]
*  There you go that kind of thing [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6171.4400000000005s)]
*  It's just mind-boggling and then when they come like they're like [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6173.4400000000005s)]
*  Boggling and then when they come like the concrete guys come and they bury it man forever [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6177.44s)]
*  No one ever sees the artistry. No one ever sees the work of the iron worker [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6183.599999999999s)]
*  Uh, you know for a hundred years it'll take good point. It'll live in the concrete. Well, that's [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6188.96s)]
*  Like so much of that is happening to people today. They feel like their good work [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6194.639999999999s)]
*  Has been covered in concrete. They feel like it's invisible. They don't feel appreciated [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6200.719999999999s)]
*  They don't feel like they're moving the needle [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6206.58s)]
*  They don't feel like they're part of a team [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6208.9s)]
*  You know and we have to do it the the toughest part then is i've found in my own life [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6211.3s)]
*  When it is if I keep and not it's not like you're playing the victim [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6215.78s)]
*  But sometimes you're the person that gets affected by something [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6219.0599999999995s)]
*  But you also have to be the person to be a part of fixing it and that's the toughest thing because there's a part of me [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6222.179999999999s)]
*  That always wants to be like this isn't fair and i'm not saying for me i've been fortunate in my life [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6227.7s)]
*  I can afford to pay my rent I can afford to buy my groceries, but there's certainly been times where i've in the past [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6232.26s)]
*  I've been like, you know [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6237.9400000000005s)]
*  This is unfortunate [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6240.1s)]
*  You know, it's their it's the it's society's this fault, but still [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6241.780000000001s)]
*  It put me in a certain position. I still have to be the one to correct my position. It's you [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6246.74s)]
*  Look at whatever it is. It starts with you. That's why the first tenet on my stupid sweat pledge [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6252.5s)]
*  is about [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6257.62s)]
*  that gratitude I don't [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6259.14s)]
*  Think you can feel sorry for yourself [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6262.42s)]
*  If your default position is grateful. Yeah. Oh, that's the truth, man [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6265.06s)]
*  I just don't think it can be a drug. I was addicted to self-pity for a long time. I didn't even realize it [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6268.9800000000005s)]
*  I was addicted to self-pity. It was like oh that's a and I would get addicted to it. Um, feels good to feel bad [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6273.860000000001s)]
*  It does especially when that's the thing you're most used to feeling it feels [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6279.54s)]
*  Impossible to even attempt to feel good [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6283.6s)]
*  I was afraid to feel good because I would be I was afraid I would leave my bad feelings behind [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6286.58s)]
*  And they were the only feelings I'd ever even known. Oh my god you you you would betray your negativity. Yes, and thereby [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6290.82s)]
*  Let yourself down again [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6298.74s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, that's a that's crazy and I never even knew that could happen man [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6300.82s)]
*  That took a ton of work to get to do that. Uh [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6304.58s)]
*  Yeah, I would love to think of something. It's so funny because i've been trying to think of that [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6308.0199999999995s)]
*  How do we fight fire with like a fire that has a feeling in it, right? And then [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6310.98s)]
*  Yeah, what about unions though we had sean o'brien come in about unions unions helps a lot of people [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6316.9800000000005s)]
*  Do you feel like unions are bad or do you feel like unions are good or it's just too broad too broad? [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6321.62s)]
*  Never mind. No, no, no, it's a great question, but it's like, okay. So the iron workers we were just talking about [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6326.26s)]
*  Yeah, that was a cheap question. Let me just fling at the end. Well, look my my my own problem [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6332.900000000001s)]
*  I it's first of all 2,200 people through micro works. I'd say maybe 20 [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6338.02s)]
*  25 percent of them are working through a union shop. Okay, most of them are electricians some plumbers [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6343.62s)]
*  But by and large [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6350.9800000000005s)]
*  you know the the percentage in my cohort of [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6352.58s)]
*  Scholarship recipients and workers is it's it's actually bigger than the national [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6357.12s)]
*  I think the national right now eight percent of workers are in a union or something like that [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6362.1s)]
*  Maybe a little less you check and i'm not sure but it's close to that [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6365.54s)]
*  So yeah, I don't [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6369.9400000000005s)]
*  I don't want to paint with too broad a brush [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6371.86s)]
*  But the thing it's it's like tier two and tier one with tariffs if you're going to have a conversation [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6373.7s)]
*  About how best to negotiate? [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6379.0599999999995s)]
*  between labor and management [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6382.82s)]
*  There you go. 10 in 23 11.2 and 23 [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6385.86s)]
*  6.7 private sector. That's the that's really what you're asking. Look at that 6.7 percent in 19 [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6390.099999999999s)]
*  In 2024 in the private sector like like iron workers or plumbers [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6396.58s)]
*  35.7 percent in the public sector that could be the post office that could be teachers that could be the seiu [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6403.04s)]
*  That could be you know, all sorts of different things if businesses start to become more like groundworks [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6410.1s)]
*  You wouldn't even need a union. Thank you. So really that's the future fire with fire. How do you yeah you it's [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6414.34s)]
*  Reconceptualizing things I call it door number three, right? You can't just [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6420.72s)]
*  Give me [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6425.54s)]
*  One or two left or right blue collar or white collar republican or democrat? [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6427.0599999999995s)]
*  No, it's all a shell game. You have to realize this whole thing has been a shell game [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6432.42s)]
*  It's a sucker's bet. Yes, it's like [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6436.179999999999s)]
*  The color of collars is no longer for sale. Don't talk to me about but blue or white [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6438.98s)]
*  That's the point of the groundwork story. You got a guy [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6444.66s)]
*  Covered with mud under your house your greatest investment. Okay doing something to save the foundation [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6447.78s)]
*  Now are you going to call that guy a blue collar worker? [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6455.54s)]
*  You're going to call that guy just a grunt that guy is a fucking superhero surgeon at that moment [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6458.5s)]
*  That's right for your family to sleep safe at night. That guy is your surgeon [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6464.66s)]
*  That's right, and he's also an owner of the company. Yeah, so now all of that other pride of ownership [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6468.5s)]
*  All of that other code driven [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6474.5s)]
*  Integrity thing right you you you can start to see [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6477.12s)]
*  How you might be able to build a cohesive unit around something other than a paycheck and that's not an excuse to say the paychecks [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6481.54s)]
*  Couldn't be better. I'm i'm just saying that if you if you only look [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6490.0199999999995s)]
*  At the economic ramifications of a tariff [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6495.38s)]
*  That's not much different than only looking at whether or not you like your job based on what your paycheck says [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6498.26s)]
*  And if you if you take the bait on that the next thing, you know, you're going to be having an argument about [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6504.42s)]
*  Ubi universal basic income and you're going to get sucked into this whole conversation about well [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6509.14s)]
*  What are people going to do if there is no work and we ought to just pay them not to do anything [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6514.98s)]
*  and then you've got all kinds of [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryokmO9MeBw&t=6519.14s)]
