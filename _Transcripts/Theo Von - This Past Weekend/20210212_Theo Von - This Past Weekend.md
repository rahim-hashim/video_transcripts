*  You know, it was a boring game [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=881.4s)]
*  You know, it was a boring game [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=886.4s)]
*  I was in the middle of the night, I was in the middle of the night, I was in the middle of the night [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=889.4s)]
*  You know, I was, it was a boring game [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=894.4s)]
*  You know, it was a boring game [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=897.4s)]
*  And I think a lot of people were just shocked, Kansas City didn't put anything together [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=900.4s)]
*  And I don't know what you attribute that to [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=909.4s)]
*  But it was nice to see Tom Brady, it was nice to see somebody get away from the system, that New England system and do something [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=914.4s)]
*  You know, it was nice to see an older person get out there and be a rascal and be Randy and do confidence [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=923.4s)]
*  And man, that made me feel really good [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=931.4s)]
*  I went over to Michael Chandler's house, UFC Michael Chandler, fighter man, you know it [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=935.4s)]
*  He came on here and you know I snuck that Dustin Poirier freaking sauce into the party son [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=942.4s)]
*  Loyalty is going to loyalty [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=950.4s)]
*  And I felt honored to go over there and just be, it was fun, man, to talk about fighting a little bit [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=953.4s)]
*  And to be able to watch the Super Bowl [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=959.4s)]
*  What else happened? [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=963.4s)]
*  I did a comedy set last night and it was one of the best shows that I've had in about a year [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=967.4s)]
*  So I'm drinking a little bit of tea right now [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=972.4s)]
*  My throat has been a little bit rocky [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=977.4s)]
*  But what else have I been doing? [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=982.4s)]
*  I hurt my neck so I've been trying to take care of that [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=985.4s)]
*  That's why I was getting the massage over there [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=988.4s)]
*  That's why I was getting massaged [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=992.4s)]
*  What else? Oh I heard a badger out back at a rental [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=998.4s)]
*  I'm in an Airbnb right now [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=1003.4s)]
*  You know doing rental living they call it [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=1006.4s)]
*  And that's rental living where you're somewhere but you really don't want to be there [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=1011.4s)]
*  And that's rental living [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=1017.4s)]
*  And so I've been doing that and last night I heard a badger out [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=1019.4s)]
*  Look I was like, I heard an animal [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=1023.4s)]
*  So I look out there and it seemed like a cat but the way he walked was more [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=1027.4s)]
*  Almost like a [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=1032.4s)]
*  Like he was, like his paws was kind of hot [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=1036.4s)]
*  And I said well surely somebody didn't heat a cat up and just let it loose outside [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=1042.4s)]
*  You know or put fire by a cat and then make it run [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=1048.4s)]
*  So I said it must be a different animal then I heard it make a noise [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=1053.4s)]
*  I heard it do some howling or whatever [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=1057.4s)]
*  And that's when I knew, oh okay something's going on here [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=1061.4s)]
*  And so I started looking up different animals sounds on the YouTubes [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=1066.4s)]
*  And what I found that it was was a badger [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=1074.4s)]
*  Listen [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=1079.4s)]
*  Yup [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=1083.4s)]
*  You hear that? [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=1085.4s)]
*  Like they swallowed a balloon like a helium balloon and they fucking bro doing sex [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=1089.4s)]
*  Listen again [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=1095.4s)]
*  Oh yeah that's like somebody fucking [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=1104.4s)]
*  You know some of them the clown will fold up that balloon for you and they'll hand it to you [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=1106.4s)]
*  And you know if you gas that thing out sometimes you pretend it's cute it's a flower it's a crown when mom and dad are around [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=1110.4s)]
*  Then you sneak off behind a barn and gas up and then you try to [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=1117.4s)]
*  You know then if you're doing sex or if you were just doing hula hooping [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=1123.4s)]
*  Anything where you got your body moving with that gas in it and you'll sound a little bit like this [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=1128.4s)]
*  Oh whoa that's bad now that that was angry man that fella got angry about something [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=1140.4s)]
*  But yeah we got some good calls that are in what's going on with me? [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=1149.4s)]
*  Not much I'm just honored to be here today man [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=1155.4s)]
*  You know I've been going through some tough stuff in my own world and I want to kind of talk about that a little bit [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=1159.4s)]
*  You know I fell off of my sobriety about a month ago [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=1165.4s)]
*  And so I've just been battling to kind of get back on that train [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=1172.4s)]
*  And I wanted to kind of talk about it on here but the timing was kind of never right [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=1180.4s)]
*  And I don't like to I don't like to have to report to the podcast every week about how I'm doing with sobriety [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=1188.4s)]
*  Because I don't want me and I don't want any of my sobriety to be like something that I then have to [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=1197.4s)]
*  Like I feel like an obligation to the podcast I don't ever want to have to feel that way [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=1212.4s)]
*  Because it doesn't it won't help me in my journey with being sober it just it won't help me [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=1217.4s)]
*  So I haven't been doing anything bad man I was just in a lot of pain and I didn't want to take pain pills [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=1225.4s)]
*  And I'd fallen off of going to my meetings and and so I just I drank and I just found that drink drinking was helping me deal with the pain better [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=1230.4s)]
*  Than pain pills I just I don't want to take pain pills and if I had a beer I could manage it was just easier [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=1243.4s)]
*  You know I could have half a beer something it would take the edge off a little and give me some relief [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=1250.4s)]
*  So you know things I've been doing now we're trying to have a meeting here at my home [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=1256.4s)]
*  You know been staying in contact with my with other people in the program [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=1264.4s)]
*  And I don't know I guess I was a little like you know I know we have some listeners that that are sober and so I didn't I guess I was afraid some that you know that they would judge me or I don't know [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=1271.4s)]
*  Yeah they would think I don't know what I don't know what I thought I mean I guess I guess yeah I guess I was just afraid of being judged or something [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=1294.4s)]
*  But you know I haven't been like scared I haven't been putting myself in bad instances but you know I definitely you know I'm just trying to you know get back on the best foot [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=1301.4s)]
*  So that's kind of where I'm at with it I guess you know so I just wanted to be honest I hope I'm not letting anybody down you know I'm just it's just you know I don't know it's just a journey and I and this is where I'm at [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=1321.4s)]
*  And so I can't be ashamed of where I'm at or anything I don't feel ashamed you know I just I want to I want to best put myself in a situation for me to be you know the healthiest that I can be and the best that I can be in most regards [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=1343.4s)]
*  You know we can only be so best you can't be 100% best you could be maybe 70% So I'm glad I said it I was kind of scared to say it and you know I've been having a lot of fun in the episodes the past couple weeks and so I didn't want to kind of make it a downer or anything [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=1364.4s)]

*  I don't think this man was coming from a place of hatred. I think he was [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=1984.2s)]
*  You know, I think he was using a word. He probably shouldn't have been using and [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=1988.1599999999999s)]
*  And you know, you don't know where somebody learns a word you don't know where [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=1993.6399999999999s)]
*  These days, you know, it's on the the n words on the radio all the time [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=1998.32s)]

*  And [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=2008.8s)]
*  You know, it's interesting cuz [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=2012.76s)]
*  Because yeah, it's that if you call some of that name and you mean it in that and you say it towards them it's man [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=2018.08s)]
*  It's hurtful [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=2024.1599999999999s)]
*  You know when I could easily see in people of color how it would [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=2026.24s)]
*  Just how it's such a word to demoralize, you know and to [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=2031.28s)]
*  And to imprison in a space of of less than [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=2038.24s)]
*  But at the same time it's it's crazy that the word is available for sale and [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=2044.8s)]
*  And I'm kind of all over the place here [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=2051.32s)]
*  And I'm not defending anybody for saying it. I mean, it's you know, you hear it. I hear it all the time [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=2054.7599999999998s)]
*  I hear it all the time. You hear it from people in these days when I when I was young you would hear it [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=2061.4s)]
*  Well, I guess I would hear when I was young growing up from people that were racist and I would hear it from music [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=2066.78s)]
*  you know in w way and and [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=2073.34s)]
*  So it's weird because it's like a word that's used in hip-hop culture, you know with the a at the end and [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=2077.6600000000003s)]
*  And so it's just it's it's interesting and I don't want to be afraid to like think about things, you know [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=2084.94s)]
*  But one thing that really made me upset about [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=2093.86s)]
*  About the n-word is the way that media outlets cover it and [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=2098.58s)]
*  The way that media outlets cover it so somebody says it right [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=2107.2200000000003s)]
*  They take it and they make articles [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=2113.1s)]
*  That say at the top of the and these are outlets that would never even cut probably cover the person that if there's a famous [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=2117.02s)]
*  person that says it [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=2122.86s)]
*  You know [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=2125.1800000000003s)]
*  You can be a white dude in a starter jacket and say it all day [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=2126.6600000000003s)]
*  You could be six nine and say it all day, you know [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=2129.7400000000002s)]
*  but if you're popular and you say it the media they cramp down on you and [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=2133.1400000000003s)]
*  What gets me? [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=2138.1800000000003s)]
*  Is that they use it the media puts n-word in the title of [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=2140.6600000000003s)]
*  articles [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=2149.02s)]
*  So they get you to go click on it and [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=2150.78s)]
*  Then then you're reading the article you're watching it or whatever it is [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=2154.3s)]
*  So they are making money [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=2158.26s)]
*  off of it and [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=2160.98s)]
*  Man that burns me up [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=2163.5s)]
*  to think that [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=2165.9s)]

*  Who is in who's who are earning money from the clicks and the people watching a reading? [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=2170.38s)]
*  I bet it leads right to white pockets. I guarantee you that [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=2177.9s)]
*  So [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=2183.42s)]
*  Man, it's just crazy that people that would never even cover this artist at all or this celebrity at all [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=2184.94s)]
*  Suddenly they're writing articles that are clickable that they're making money on so they're basically [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=2191.46s)]
*  Making money off of the n-word [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=2197.86s)]

*  That's what it makes me feel like [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=2236.7s)]
*  You know because you have companies that don't care and now that so they're basically you they are using the n-word to make money [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=2239.62s)]
*  and [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=2247.38s)]

*  And i'm happy because [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=5006.76s)]
*  No, it's not really happiness because then my emotions start to fade away and I can tell if they fade away then i'm not on the trail [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=5011.8s)]
*  So then i'll be like are you [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=5018.04s)]
*  Surprised [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=5020.9800000000005s)]
*  Sometimes the word will come in my head. Am I surprised? Yes [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=5022.52s)]
*  So now I answer yes, i'm surprised [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=5026.84s)]
*  And then why are you surprised? [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=5030.2s)]
*  And then i'm surprised because [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=5039.4800000000005s)]
*  I guess i'm surprised because people care [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=5047.16s)]
*  So, you know i'm surprised because people care [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=5057.56s)]
*  Because I think you know when I was young as shit growing up I felt like nobody cared bro [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=5071.88s)]
*  I [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=5081.32s)]
*  I [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=5083.32s)]
*  And you put up all these things inside of you because nobody cares, you know, and then [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=5089.32s)]
*  You happen upon a small moment where somebody really cares, you know and uh [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=5095.48s)]
*  And it just disproves everything he thought you ever knew about the world man and that is [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=5104.84s)]
*  Surprising [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=5109.08s)]
*  So that's how I work through when i'm having like a emotional thing like where I figure out what i'm feeling I have to ask myself [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=5112.12s)]
*  Are you happy or are you [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=5121.0s)]
*  Shameful or you you know you have to ask and then [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=5127.0s)]
*  If it still feels it's almost like a metal detector if it still feels like you're getting a little bit of a feeling then [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=5130.28s)]
*  I'll say well, why am I happy or why am I ashamed or why am I [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=5135.959999999999s)]
*  Um mad, you know, and then sometimes I can [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=5141.4s)]
*  I can badger up those feelings [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=5146.839999999999s)]
*  Y'all should see these badges bro these things [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pwigIlemk&t=5154.679999999999s)]
