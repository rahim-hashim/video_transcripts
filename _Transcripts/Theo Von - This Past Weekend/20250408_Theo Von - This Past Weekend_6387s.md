*  Page to Stage? [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=1742.02s)]
*  Yeah, like you come up with a bit idea [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=1742.9799999999998s)]
*  and then you go up at Zany's and work it out [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=1745.02s)]
*  and it's clunky and then you work it out again [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=1747.06s)]
*  and again and again and then eventually you crack it [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=1748.58s)]
*  and then you're doing it at an arena. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=1750.62s)]
*  That's the show. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=1752.5s)]
*  So it shows the comic thinking of a bit [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=1753.62s)]
*  and then struggling with it [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=1756.1799999999998s)]
*  and then eventually figuring it out and killing with it. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=1757.34s)]
*  And like in between, oh that's an example of it right there? [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=1760.4199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, we've done a couple episodes already [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=1763.4199999999998s)]
*  and this is episode one. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=1765.6s)]
*  We just put out episode two. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=1767.86s)]
*  Hey, is this stupid? [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=1771.3s)]
*  I'm bombing all day long. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=1772.4599999999998s)]
*  I hope this wasn't an expensive ticket. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=1774.3s)]
*  Oh, this is great, man. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=1777.54s)]

*  You've got a dumb idea, that's how comedy starts. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=1781.26s)]
*  You take it on stage, it bombs and you do it again. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=1783.6200000000001s)]
*  Too far. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=1787.14s)]

*  I mean, Austin's fun. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=1904.38s)]
*  Cause when you're working on new shit, [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=1905.7s)]
*  you gotta be able to bounce around. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=1906.8200000000002s)]
*  You can't just do one set every now and then. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=1908.14s)]
*  I agree. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=1910.26s)]

*  For me, it's like that third time you do it in a night, [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=1912.78s)]
*  even if you don't even want to do it. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=1915.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=1916.54s)]
*  And nothing comes out of it, [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=1917.38s)]
*  but it's still just burning that like, [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=1918.2s)]
*  every time you cook it, you just cook it. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=1920.22s)]
*  And it's like, so the next time will be good, right? [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=1922.1000000000001s)]
*  100%. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=1924.3s)]
*  You know, they say when you lift weights, [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=1925.14s)]
*  the one where you're like, ah, and you can't get it up. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=1926.66s)]
*  That's the one that matters the most. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=1928.78s)]
*  And it's the same with comedy. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=1930.02s)]
*  I think when you're working on that new one [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=1930.94s)]
*  and you don't want to say it and it's not really working, [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=1932.38s)]
*  that's when you find it. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=1934.9s)]
*  When you just push it. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=1936.0600000000002s)]

*  Yeah, yeah, that was really something. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=1969.1s)]

*  We were all losers in Louisiana. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=1972.3s)]
*  I remember walking by like some of the Saints players [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=1974.3s)]
*  and they're all said, we're gonna steal your girlfriend. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=1976.26s)]

*  We're all eating, but everybody stopped eating [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2509.18s)]
*  because it's like you can't eat while a guy [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2511.06s)]
*  is choking to death. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2513.54s)]
*  Of course, of course. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2514.7799999999997s)]
*  And they're doing CPR and shit on him. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2515.62s)]
*  So then everybody starts kind of looking at Magic Johnson [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2518.06s)]
*  like when do we eat, right? [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2520.66s)]
*  He became somehow like the liaison of feasting [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2522.02s)]
*  or whatever they call it. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2528.58s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2529.4199999999996s)]
*  In the Greek mythology or whatever. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2530.78s)]
*  And so everybody's watching him [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2532.5400000000004s)]
*  and you can tell he starts to feel this pressure. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2535.46s)]
*  When do we eat? [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2537.1400000000003s)]
*  And they get the guy back, right? [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2538.5s)]
*  Oh, thank God. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2540.0600000000004s)]
*  So you can hear him, he starts coughing. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2541.0200000000004s)]
*  Everybody claps, right? [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2543.1800000000003s)]
*  So everybody takes one bite [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2544.3s)]
*  and then fucking something happened immediately [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2545.34s)]
*  and the guy coded. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2547.34s)]
*  The guy died right there. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2548.78s)]
*  Shut up. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2550.26s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2551.5800000000004s)]
*  Guy died. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2553.26s)]
*  Now what do you do with the food? [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2554.1000000000004s)]
*  Do you finish it? [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2554.98s)]
*  Oh, we waited like seven or eight minutes [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2555.82s)]
*  and then we ate as quiet as we could. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2557.26s)]
*  Ever eaten. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2560.26s)]
*  Oh man, that's awkward. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2561.42s)]
*  They got to wheel them out on the gurney [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2562.94s)]
*  and you got a mouthful of General Tso. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2564.2200000000003s)]
*  You chew so quietly, dude. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2566.2200000000003s)]
*  Oh dude. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2568.42s)]
*  And if your wife doesn't salute you like that [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2569.26s)]
*  when you eat General Tso, [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2571.1400000000003s)]
*  you're not a fucking true American Asian. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2572.1400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, she'll get a kung pow. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2575.82s)]
*  That's what I'm saying, dude. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2577.46s)]
*  I'll fucking yeah. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2579.1400000000003s)]
*  Speaking of, did you see these Yankee bats, by the way? [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2580.5800000000004s)]
*  Oh, I've heard about this. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2584.3s)]
*  This is pretty, I want to get your take on these bats. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2585.34s)]
*  I don't know where the Yankees have, [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2587.5800000000004s)]
*  their bats are fat as shit. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2589.3s)]
*  Oh, come on. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2591.9s)]
*  Nuh-uh, that's what they're using now? [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2592.7400000000002s)]
*  The torpedo bat, yeah. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2594.5800000000004s)]
*  Oh yeah, they plump them up a little. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2596.54s)]
*  Like in the middle. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2599.02s)]
*  Yeah, like a weird dick that girthy in the middle [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2599.86s)]
*  and then cones out. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2603.0600000000004s)]
*  Well, that seems weird [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2604.5s)]
*  because wouldn't the angle of the bat then [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2605.34s)]
*  affect which direction you're hitting the ball even? [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2607.34s)]
*  Yeah, I think but they engineered it perfectly [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2609.7400000000002s)]
*  where it just sails it. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2611.78s)]
*  It works every time. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2613.42s)]
*  During spring training, [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2614.7000000000003s)]
*  someone in the organization for the Yankees [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2615.54s)]
*  had mentioned to Kay [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2617.1400000000003s)]
*  that the team's analytics department had counseled players [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2618.02s)]
*  on where pitches tended to strike their bats [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2620.34s)]
*  and with subsequent buy-in from some of the players, [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2622.38s)]
*  bats have been designed around that information. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2624.62s)]
*  In the hours before the Yankees home game [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2627.58s)]
*  against the Brewers that day, [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2629.38s)]
*  Kay, who is the Yankees play-by-play man, [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2631.26s)]
*  told the YES Network production staff about this, [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2634.18s)]
*  alerting them so they could look for an opportunity [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2636.98s)]
*  to highlight the equipment. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2639.06s)]
*  After the Yankees clubbed four homers in the first inning, [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2640.7400000000002s)]
*  a camera zoomed in on Jay Chisholm's bat [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2644.02s)]
*  in the second inning. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2646.26s)]
*  You see the shape of Chisholm's bat, Kay said on there. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2647.46s)]
*  It's got a big barrel on it. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2650.2200000000003s)]
*  Wow, and it does, it has a look towards like the, [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2652.54s)]
*  one part like a snake digesting something a bit. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2655.38s)]
*  Yes, yes, exactly. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2657.58s)]
*  Wow, and how are the Yankees doing so far? [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2660.46s)]
*  Was that just one good game to start off? [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2662.62s)]
*  No, they're killing it. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2664.34s)]
*  I mean, you got four homers in the first inning. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2665.1800000000003s)]
*  I mean, they're on fire, [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2666.78s)]
*  which they were already a good team, [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2668.2200000000003s)]
*  but now they got this secret weapon. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2669.9s)]
*  Oh, they're four and two right now, gang, [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2672.78s)]
*  starting off big. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2674.26s)]
*  Okay, still know Otani. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2675.22s)]
*  That guy's incredible. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2678.58s)]
*  Oh, he's so good, man. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2679.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, that's interesting. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2681.3399999999997s)]
*  How, like, are they allowed to just change [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2682.3399999999997s)]
*  their bats like that? [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2684.62s)]
*  Can you look at why they're allowed to do that? [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2685.66s)]
*  I think it's one of those air bud things. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2688.4599999999996s)]
*  It's other than the rule books [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2689.7799999999997s)]
*  is you can't have a fat bat or whatever it is. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2690.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, the idea of the torpedo bat [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2692.8999999999996s)]
*  is to take a size format, say 34 inches and 32 ounces, [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2695.74s)]
*  and distribute the wood in a different shape [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2698.2999999999997s)]
*  than the transitional form [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2700.8999999999996s)]
*  to ensure the fattest part of the bat [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2703.18s)]
*  is located where the player makes the most contact. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2704.7s)]
*  Wow. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2707.98s)]
*  It's just a loophole. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2708.8199999999997s)]
*  They found a loophole that's still legal. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2709.66s)]
*  It's the same amount of wood, [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2711.02s)]
*  but they just put it in different spots of the bat. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2713.02s)]
*  The torpedo bat moves some of the mass [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2715.2599999999998s)]
*  on the end of the bat about six to seven inches lower, [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2716.8199999999997s)]
*  giving it a bowling pin shape with a much thinner end. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2718.98s)]
*  The benefits for those who like swinging with it, [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2723.54s)]
*  and not everyone who has swung with it likes it, [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2725.5s)]
*  are twofold. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2727.1s)]
*  Both are rooted in logic and physics. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2727.94s)]
*  The first is that distributing more mass [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2729.54s)]
*  to the area of most frequent contact [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2731.14s)]
*  aligns with players' swing patterns [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2732.62s)]
*  and provides greater impact when the bat strikes ball. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2734.22s)]
*  The second benefit in theory is increased bat speed. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2738.38s)]
*  Imagine a sledgehammer and a broomstick [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2740.7799999999997s)]
*  that both weigh 32 ounces. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2743.14s)]
*  The sledgehammer's weight is almost all at the end, [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2744.7799999999997s)]
*  whereas the broomstick is distributed evenly. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2747.2599999999998s)]
*  Damn. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2749.74s)]
*  Which is easier to swing fast. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2750.58s)]
*  The broomstick, of course. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2751.54s)]
*  So they're saying that it's slower to swing, the new one. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2752.66s)]
*  Yeah, but it's got more impact. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2755.8199999999997s)]
*  By shedding some of the weight off the end of the torpedo bat [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2759.54s)]
*  and moving it towards the middle, [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2762.06s)]
*  hitters have found it swings very similarly [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2763.22s)]
*  to a traditional model, [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2765.02s)]
*  but with slightly faster bat velocity. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2766.34s)]
*  I haven't seen a bat like that since the wet market. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2772.06s)]
*  God, I know, huh? [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2774.94s)]
*  Damn, that's interesting. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2776.74s)]
*  I wonder what other loopholes have I noticed. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2777.58s)]
*  What other things? [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2780.18s)]
*  Well, there was a part where they allegedly [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2781.02s)]

*  Those were the days. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2814.46s)]

*  Exactly. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2822.26s)]
*  Let us do business here. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2823.5s)]
*  Well, women really got screwed because, like, [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2825.62s)]
*  they couldn't really make a lot of money back then, [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2827.38s)]
*  so they needed a guy who had a house and a car and a job, [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2829.14s)]
*  so, like, they had to be nice and play ball. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2832.3s)]
*  That's gotta suck. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2835.54s)]
*  You imagine the resentment built up in a lot of those women? [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2836.66s)]
*  Oh, of course, of course. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2839.02s)]
*  That's why a lot of third generation women are squirters, [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2840.66s)]
*  I think, because it's all that resentment built up. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2843.42s)]
*  That's true, yeah, it all comes out. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2845.26s)]
*  That's fucking, what do you call that? [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2847.02s)]
*  Oh, what's the word when they can't vote? [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2850.02s)]

*  We'll get it right. Voter suppression. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2858.14s)]
*  Something like that. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2860.18s)]
*  Suffrage? Suffrage. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2862.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=2864.54s)]

*  Does it create a new relationship with your wife? [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=3377.7s)]
*  Like is there now some, [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=3379.78s)]
*  cause I've heard Schultz say that like, [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=3381.34s)]
*  he would have times where he would call his wife [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=3383.94s)]
*  to check on the baby and not be checking on her kind of, [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=3385.3s)]
*  and so like he said just, [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=3387.62s)]
*  there were little dynamics like that [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=3389.62s)]
*  that he started to notice where, [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=3391.06s)]
*  does it make like a new relationship with you and your wife? [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=3393.42s)]
*  Does things still seem the same? [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=3395.9s)]
*  Does it, or everything's just normal? [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=3397.3s)]
*  Like any thoughts on any of that? [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=3399.46s)]
*  It's super different. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=3401.06s)]
*  Like the baby becomes the priority. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=3402.22s)]
*  So you start to forget about each other. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=3404.74s)]
*  You know, it just becomes like, [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=3406.54s)]
*  all right, I'll take him for this moment. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=3408.1s)]
*  You take him for that moment. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=3409.46s)]
*  You feed him. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=3410.46s)]
*  Did you put him down? [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=3411.28s)]
*  How's that going? [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=3412.22s)]
*  So it turns into scheduling and very like calculated almost. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=3413.14s)]
*  So you gotta stay lovey, you gotta stay a couple. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=3417.02s)]
*  And so it's kind of like the two of you versus the baby. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=3420.54s)]
*  And you become a team, but you gotta make the team fun. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=3423.62s)]
*  You can't just go all in on logistics. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=3426.08s)]
*  You gotta still be cuddly and sexy and all that shit and fun. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=3428.6s)]
*  And is it hard, how long do you have to wait [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=3433.6s)]
*  before you can be sexually active with your spouse? [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=3435.46s)]
*  I think it was six weeks. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=3438.18s)]
*  So we did like six weeks and a day before I went, [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=3439.26s)]
*  and I f***ing f***ed her on accident. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=3442.9s)]
*  I was like, what am I doing? [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=3445.34s)]
*  I'm an idiot. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=3446.72s)]
*  This is how the Jackson five started, you know? [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=3447.9s)]
*  Why would you do that? [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=3450.42s)]
*  I was like, I had been so long. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=3451.42s)]
*  I lasted like eight seconds and I couldn't pull out. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=3453.26s)]
*  It felt good. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=3458.26s)]
*  So I... [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=3459.1s)]
*  Dude, you knew what just happened there. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=3459.94s)]
*  I know, I know, I'm an idiot. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=3462.06s)]
*  But hopefully she's barren at this point. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=3463.9s)]
*  But that's like walking out of a burning building, right? [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=3466.42s)]
*  Going into another one. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=3471.46s)]
*  And then, yeah, hold on, and then... [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=3472.38s)]
*  It's like leaving tower one and going into tower two. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=3474.06s)]
*  Yeah, and it says gas above the door. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=3476.34s)]
*  And you go in there and f***ing blaze up a smoke. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=3478.7s)]
*  I know, I couldn't help it. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=3480.8999999999996s)]
*  And she was like, what the f*** are you doing? [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=3482.3399999999997s)]
*  And I was like, you're right, you're right. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=3483.8999999999996s)]
*  So... [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=3485.42s)]
*  Do you think you did that? [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=3486.2999999999997s)]
*  Is it almost, was it territorial or were you just partying? [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=3487.3799999999997s)]
*  I think I was partying. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=3489.7s)]
*  I let loose too much. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=3490.54s)]
*  I'm an idiot. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=3491.94s)]
*  But I'm just lucky we had a kid the normal way, [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=3493.2999999999997s)]
*  the old fashioned way. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=3496.74s)]
*  Everyone else is doing the IVF and adopting and all that. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=3497.94s)]

*  You know otherwise your group can get totally just trampled over I guess so but at the same time [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=5036.92s)]
*  It's like but there's a hierarchy. That's part of the problem, too [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=5042.96s)]
*  It's like black trans is more important than right like a lady yeah, yeah then Asian [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=5045.96s)]

*  But really when you think about it [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=5071.4400000000005s)]
*  We can find a difference anywhere and hate somebody like the Hutus and the Tutsis [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=5072.76s)]
*  They're all black, but they just hate each other for some religious reason. I'm a too stupid to know oh [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=5076.64s)]
*  I'm huh too stupid to do [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=5082.76s)]
*  But what I'm saying is if they join together and just attacked whoever owned the fucking land right near them there you go [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=5084.4400000000005s)]
*  Then they would make some progress. That's a perfect example [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=5090.16s)]
*  The bloods in the crypts it just it just comes down to clothing at that point. You know blue verse red. It's silly [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=5093.0s)]
*  Yeah, I um [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=5099.2s)]
*  Was something you said a second ago is really great. Oh the [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=5100.8s)]
*  These tariffs are getting getting out of control oh [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=5105.88s)]
*  Yeah, the tariffs are getting out of control all the everyday items that will cost Americans more following Donald Trump's global tariffs, but [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=5108.84s)]
*  Here's the thing with tariffs is the the goal of tariffs is that if they if it costs more for people to bring their products [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=5115.6s)]
*  And then they'll build them here. Yes, right part of it. Yeah, so it's kind of a long-term play [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=5122.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, it's gonna take a while. It's gonna be bumpy for a while right, but that's if it works right, so we'll see but [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=5127.78s)]
*  Uh it might take ten years right if we don't try this though, then I think it's a wrap oh [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=5133.66s)]
*  You can just go for it bite bite the belt and go for it [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=5139.42s)]
*  I do because I think at this point even from my own perception [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=5142.54s)]
*  We'd probably on this tour this comedy tour been probably the top 200 cities like size wise in America [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=5145.54s)]
*  maybe maybe even more than that and [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=5150.58s)]
*  a [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=5153.9s)]
*  Lot of them there's nothing there. Yes, it's empty [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=5155.38s)]
*  Downtowns oh yeah, it's that we're in Amarillo. It's empty downtown Shreveport, Louisiana. It was empty downtown [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=5160.5s)]
*  Toledo, Ohio right it's getting a little bit better there [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=5168.26s)]
*  But and that's just a few I mean a lot of places Montgomery just empty yep, and so you start to be like [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=5172.1s)]
*  Nothing's gonna. There's nothing coming that's gonna make that different right yeah [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=5180.06s)]
*  And maybe it doesn't matter [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=5184.86s)]
*  Maybe that's just how society changes and evolves and we just end up with like seven big cities in America and the rest of it [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=5185.78s)]
*  Is just like rural land where people live and have great lives, but they're not in like a city [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=5192.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, and these things fall by the wayside and don't forget. We got automation coming that AI coming [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=5196.54s)]
*  So like jobs are going away quick and everything's digital now. There's nothing manufactured here [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=5202.34s)]
*  And why do we keep building right and that's one of the that's one of the things that people say well even if you bring [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=5207.94s)]
*  Jobs back here those jobs are gonna disappear because of AI anyway. Oh [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=5212.42s)]
*  That's one of the side. That's one of the other arguments against um [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=5216.22s)]
*  Against doing the tariffs at all damn Alan [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQ-Yfps_Os&t=5220.54s)]
