*  there is [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=324.22s)]
*  There you know like among comedians there is like there is this strange [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=326.14s)]
*  thing where I think [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=332.38s)]
*  Some comedians get embraced as being attractive [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=335.1s)]

*  Theoretical thing that you know like steve corral like I think there was like this is just maybe me, you know getting it from twitter, but [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=344.52s)]

*  What about like in the 1700s or something? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=366.46s)]
*  like [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=369.82s)]
*  Was there a time period you think because I mean, I think I think you're a handsome you're height [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=371.02s)]
*  You're tall so that gives you some handsome. Well pale [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=375.58s)]
*  You know and then there was the ruben-esque period like oh, yeah, you know like being [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=378.94s)]
*  Being pudgy means that you're not poor [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=385.5s)]
*  And being pale means that you're not working in the field [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=388.94s)]
*  But I don't think that's been relevant you'd have been the rock dude in the 1600s 1600s [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=391.98s)]

*  You'd be like that person's crazy for saying that to that monkey, right? [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1101.26s)]
*  Or you or or there'll probably be some people that are like finally someone's telling that monkey [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1105.58s)]
*  Stop doing that [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1111.18s)]

*  Behavior, do you know what I mean? Yeah, there'd be somebody else being like that monkey can choose its own pronouns [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1120.8600000000001s)]
*  And be like it's not about that. Okay, the monkey is just jerking off [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1127.1000000000001s)]

*  They're willing to throw it [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1142.06s)]
*  Why do we I feel like you're like marty grahl we have you know, but there's no beads, right? [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1143.74s)]

*  They're naked all the way like it's it's not like they're even flashing because like supposedly if you flash then [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1158.3799999999999s)]
*  The like women flash, yeah, they show their breasts to see the beads but to get the beads [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1165.02s)]
*  But the problem was at marty grahl and i'll say this man is that the breasts you saw [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1169.58s)]
*  Were good or bad. They were not good, right? [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1174.54s)]

*  We set up false expectations of what breasts are supposed to look like [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1190.7s)]
*  Yeah, that's another reason not to watch porn [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1195.26s)]
*  Right. Well, you've kind of gone with the game. I mean, i'm sure you've seen in your lifetime where breasts fake breasts really popped off [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1198.54s)]

*  and um [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1416.6200000000001s)]
*  I mean that's a setup for a joke. He's you know, like now he's like a serial killer, right? [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1418.3s)]

*  That's it. That's a really good point, right? [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1441.9s)]
*  It's kind of like, you know, I remember when I was [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1444.5400000000002s)]

*  Yeah sense of humor or the ability to laugh even being able to laugh though is also like having an inverse sense of humor [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1586.22s)]
*  like if somebody's a good laugher, I think it's just as [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1592.14s)]
*  It's almost better than a sense of humor because at least they're they're getting they're having the joy [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1595.18s)]

*  You know, I want her to be able to bear, you know, bear children if she wants to yeah [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1687.02s)]

*  and I [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1751.98s)]
*  you know my wife and I we had this agreement that [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1753.5800000000002s)]
*  She was going to tell me when she was ready to be proposed, you know, because you know the whole you you don't [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1757.26s)]
*  There's no risk. You don't want them to be like, uh, no and you don't want you to process. No [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1763.02s)]
*  so and we had talked about we had dated for a while and um [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1768.94s)]
*  And I was at my brother's place and uh, we were smoking a cigar in his garage [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1773.74s)]
*  and I [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1780.0600000000002s)]
*  Said, you know, I tell you if I had a ring I probably would ask her and he goes [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1781.66s)]
*  Oh, I can give you a ring. I'll give you a mom's old ring [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1785.74s)]
*  I used it and you can use it and I was like, oh [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1788.6200000000001s)]
*  and so then [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1792.3s)]
*  You're really on the spot and I was like [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1793.8200000000002s)]
*  All right, but you know again, I had also kind of [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1796.54s)]
*  Made that decision do you know what I mean? So the decision had already been made. Yeah [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1800.38s)]
*  You know, I mean it wasn't like oh my brother told me to do it. So I did it [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1804.78s)]
*  You know what I mean? So, uh, and then we went up there and I knew that I kind of wanted to surprise her [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1808.22s)]
*  And so I did it right in front of her entire family. She's one of nine kids and [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1814.94s)]
*  We had done opening presents and her [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1819.66s)]
*  I had asked her dad for permission. He was like cooking in the [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1823.02s)]
*  Kitchen he's kind of a a great guy, but like at that point we didn't know each other that well [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1827.26s)]
*  So he was like taking something out of the oven. I was like, hey, I'd like to ask your daughter [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1832.6999999999998s)]
*  He's like, yeah, okay [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1837.58s)]
*  and so then we're opening presents and all the presents had been opened and then I [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1839.82s)]
*  I did it and it was did you feel nervous? Did you get down on one knee? It's so well, I think as a comedian [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1845.9799999999998s)]
*  There's so many [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1852.9399999999998s)]
*  It's you know, there's so many awkward situations we go in [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1855.9s)]
*  You know where you have a show where you eat shit you have a show where? [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1859.74s)]
*  You do. Okay, but you can tell half the audience thinks you're a moron [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1865.1000000000001s)]
*  I mean so like [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1869.9s)]
*  it was [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1871.74s)]
*  It was awkward. It was uh, it was you know, it was nice but it's [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1873.5s)]
*  I'm also [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1879.98s)]
*  You know, oh these these watershed moments for me are uh [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1882.54s)]
*  They're not nearly as important as like [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1889.58s)]
*  you know [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1893.18s)]
*  The the moment where I feel like I really connected with my wife, you know [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1894.8600000000001s)]
*  Like my child being born there was you know, it was special but it's not as special as like [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1899.34s)]
*  You know the time when you take a walk with them, right for me and you have some yeah [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1905.9s)]
*  There's like a real connection. Yeah, I mean or like right those are kind of just built-in tent pole moments that are yes [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1910.7s)]
*  Almost I don't want to say old-fashioned. They're very important. Yeah, but they don't but that it's not like it doesn't mean everything [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1915.98s)]
*  I I for me, you know if I'm getting that's a good point [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1922.06s)]
*  I think it's a really good point for everybody [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1924.94s)]
*  We put all these old it's almost like we put these kind of like tyrannical like emotional attachments to these moments [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1926.8600000000001s)]
*  Even though they're they might not be there because times have kind of changed [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1934.06s)]
*  So yeah having a wedding these days, which is really just a huge party that takes so much planning [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1938.06s)]
*  Which is more about the planning than it is even the vows. Yes, and this the unnecessary stress [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1942.94s)]
*  Oh god put on you know, the sangria all these [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1949.02s)]
*  Yeah, you know, oh my god, the bread was wrong. You know, it's like who cares [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1952.46s)]
*  Yeah, who cares? [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1956.86s)]
*  Right, I barely know this woman [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1958.38s)]
*  Who cares? She's pregnant. That's the only reason i'm here. Yeah [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1960.94s)]
*  They should have a vote at weddings like should we do it or not and people have to really vote [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1968.14s)]
*  That's funny wouldn't be a bad idea with it. I mean a silent [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1973.02s)]
*  And because it's also your loved one. So it's a really harsh thing and you shouldn't be able to open it until [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1977.26s)]
*  The next day. Oh [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1984.78s)]
*  It's like the vote came in [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1986.78s)]
*  Well is and it's like a rotten tomato score like as long as we get 80 percent [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1989.9s)]
*  Yeah, that's it [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1995.02s)]
*  But you're like, yeah 43 percent. Yeah, that's not good. But what the audience score say [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=1996.62s)]
*  A lot of old tropes and misdirected plot twists, but [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2005.26s)]
*  A lot of people don't believe in me. They think i'm gonna cause [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2011.1799999999998s)]
*  Your family should have a vote should have a vote because you're bringing that genetics into your gene pool [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2014.9399999999998s)]
*  Well, yeah, you know, it feels like the family overall should have a vote [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2020.6999999999998s)]
*  Well, there's also something that happens where [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2025.26s)]
*  You I think the you know, it's probably different in different cultures and different family cultures, but you kind of [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2029.4199999999998s)]
*  Get absorbed. I think I feel like the men get kind of absorbed into the [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2037.1799999999998s)]
*  The woman's family. Yes [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2042.78s)]
*  much more than [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2045.34s)]
*  The woman getting absorbed into them. I mean obviously there's a good point. Yeah, and it's so there is something of [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2047.1s)]
*  You know like when you're dating someone and you meet their parents you're like, okay, so this is this is the future right in some ways [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2055.58s)]
*  But also their relationship and my wife's mother is like a saint and her dad's a real sweet guy [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2063.5s)]
*  So I was like, all right, i'm in good shape. It was totally misleading. No, but it was fine [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2070.46s)]
*  Dude I had an ex-girlfriend her dad would always be like hey [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2077.1s)]
*  He would say like whenever nobody was in the room. He'd be like, hey listen to me [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2079.8199999999997s)]
*  He would pass gas he'd say listen to me fart and then he'd be like don't tell anybody [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2082.7799999999997s)]
*  And he was real serious about it and it was so strange [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2087.98s)]
*  And i've never even said anything about it until now, but I just can't believe he even did that who would yeah [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2091.66s)]
*  That's very strange really weird. I think having like somebody dating your daughter. Oh, you don't have any power really [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2096.46s)]
*  No, you have no power and you know, I and the kid is a pervert whoever he is. Absolutely [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2103.34s)]

*  I have a 19 year old and I have a 14 year old daughter and so [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2113.8199999999997s)]
*  When my 14 year old when she was 13, uh [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2119.18s)]
*  And she would bring over these guys [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2123.1s)]
*  And I would try and [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2126.54s)]
*  You know like you try different tactics as a dad. You're like, i'm gonna be the friend [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2128.9399999999996s)]
*  And you want to get to know them and they're all you know, they're they're boys. They're liars, right? [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2133.58s)]
*  and so [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2139.02s)]
*  I remember there was this one kid who ended up being really sweet and but I was kind of like [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2140.14s)]
*  And i'm kind of like inappropriate. I try to test the boundaries. So i'm like [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2146.7799999999997s)]
*  Nice to meet you. I'd like to um, would you like to see my knife collection? [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2151.98s)]
*  thinking [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2156.62s)]
*  That would be really intimidating and he's like, oh my god, i'd love to see a knife collection [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2157.74s)]
*  I was like, that's not what I wanted you to say [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2162.62s)]
*  He was like, oh cool, you got a knife collection i'm like no I was trying to frighten you [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2165.7400000000002s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? It's like [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2170.7000000000003s)]
*  But they also know you know, you're not gonna hurt them. You know what I mean? [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2173.18s)]
*  You can't anymore. That's one of the problems too [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2177.58s)]
*  And that's where a lot of you know, a lot of fathers have lost a lot of their power [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2179.98s)]
*  They used to have the ability to hurt to fire a warning shot into the air. Yeah [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2183.1s)]
*  And a lot of that's gone [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2189.02s)]
*  Yeah, I was thinking about yeah, it's so like [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2190.54s)]
*  Even like us what we think about ourselves how we look like [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2192.86s)]
*  I mean, I think a lot of comedians probably got a lot of males got into it because they felt [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2196.46s)]
*  It was their way of gaining attraction from women. Did you think so? You think yeah, totally. I remember [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2201.9s)]
*  I remember witnessing [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2209.18s)]
*  um, like I had no confidence at all until my 30s anyway, but [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2211.66s)]
*  I remember I mean I had it in fits and spurts but [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2216.94s)]
*  I remember when I started [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2220.94s)]
*  headlining at a comedy club [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2223.64s)]
*  And I would stand in the back watching [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2226.7799999999997s)]
*  This is like they didn't have green rooms or anything like that and I would stand in the back kind of watching [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2229.82s)]
*  and I would see people come in [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2235.34s)]
*  and um [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2238.62s)]
*  There would be you know attractive women coming in with their friends or dates or whatever [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2240.14s)]
*  and they would be like [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2246.3s)]
*  Who are you know, they they didn't know who I was they didn't care and then I would do the show [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2248.3s)]
*  and then those same women [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2254.6200000000003s)]
*  would be [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2257.34s)]
*  Treating me completely differently and intellectually I would know. Oh, it was the show [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2258.7000000000003s)]
*  They you know, they [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2265.5s)]
*  You know, they they think i'm something that i'm not they think that i'm something special [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2267.82s)]
*  I have to make a point of never [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2272.6200000000003s)]
*  Believing the hype and then after six months I was like, you know what? I'm good looking [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2275.82s)]
*  I kind of totally bought the hype [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2280.62s)]
*  Like so we just get [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2284.06s)]
*  We're so dumb [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2286.78s)]
*  We're so dumb [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2288.7s)]
*  It's like [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2290.54s)]
*  It's it's not that i'm on stage and commanding authority over in a crowded room of 300 people [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2291.74s)]
*  It's because they actually think i'm good [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2298.46s)]
*  I [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2300.46s)]
*  Essentially i'm just a fool. You know what I mean? But then some guys who are not attractive men will [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2302.86s)]
*  Their confidence gets them to attract. Oh, absolutely. So it's really part of the trick. I think yeah [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2309.66s)]
*  I even feel like when you look at [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2315.5s)]
*  Remember when you would I don't know if you'd ever look at a yearbook [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2318.62s)]
*  and uh [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2322.7s)]
*  Or photos of when you were a kid and you'd see a kid [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2324.46s)]
*  That you'd be a girl you'd be like, oh my god, she was really good looking. Yeah [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2329.1s)]
*  and why weren't we [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2333.98s)]
*  Why didn't we think because we didn't because she was [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2336.3799999999997s)]
*  Struggling, you know what I mean? And didn't have the confidence and whereas there were girls that were confident that we were just like [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2340.52s)]
*  Because we were dumb boys. We're like, uh, they think they're good looking. Maybe they're good looking [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2347.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, and we would it's so much of it is confidence [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2352.62s)]
*  And it's like I just wish as a parent I could just [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2356.94s)]
*  uh, you know [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2360.46s)]
*  Because my kids are pretty confident, but I just wish that like in those moments [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2361.9s)]
*  Because I remember being a teenager. It's it's hard. Yeah, huh? [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2366.1400000000003s)]
*  And people are like just act confident. You're like, what are you talking about? Yeah, i'm filled with anxiety [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2371.1000000000004s)]
*  And I had so dude. I remember having acne so bad. Do you ever have acne? [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2376.94s)]
*  Oh, I was just I mean I was this pale kid and whenever I would talk [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2381.02s)]
*  In public you turn red turn red [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2386.1400000000003s)]
*  and so I was just this goofy guy who was pale and like [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2389.26s)]
*  You know [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2393.98s)]
*  There it was I was the palest person anyone had ever seen [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2394.94s)]
*  So it was but that's probably you know contributed to me being a comedian like a dumpling kind of yeah [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2399.34s)]
*  I was like a marshmallow. Oh, you know, but a marshmallow that would turn red. I was a strawberry flavored marshmallow [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2405.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2412.48s)]
*  Wow dude, yeah [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2415.36s)]
*  well, it's it's um [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2416.88s)]
*  What's really interesting is if you think back to like the beginning of before they had mirrors and stuff [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2418.72s)]
*  The only way you knew if you were [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2423.12s)]
*  The way you probably is if somebody told you how attractive you were or how handsome or beautiful you were [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2425.52s)]
*  so that had to be I bet that's when like connection was a lot stronger too between uh people because [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2432.16s)]
*  imagine if the way you [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2438.4s)]
*  Somebody's like you're beautiful and you've never you don't have any real thought of that yourself because you have never seen a reflection [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2440.48s)]
*  Of yourself and the way it makes you feel you're like wow that feeling is so powerful [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2445.44s)]
*  I feel really connected to this person. Yeah now it's like well back then I mean just [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2449.6s)]
*  Imagine how bad did they smell though? [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2455.28s)]
*  But they both smelled bad. They both I guess she got used to it, right? [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2458.56s)]
*  I think not having shit on your legs was probably like a that means you were [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2462.32s)]
*  Right ready to go out on the town because I feel like that would be something i'm gonna clean i'm gonna wash my legs [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2465.76s)]
*  On well, that's what all the cologne and the perfume was for is to cover up bad smell the smell of butt. Yeah [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2470.4s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2478.32s)]
*  God it's always it'd be so much nicer if your butt was a little further away from you, right? [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2479.76s)]
*  Or you could detach it. Oh [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2485.92s)]
*  Yeah, but like I mean showering like you ever like been on the road and you're like you have to wear the same [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2488.7200000000003s)]
*  Underwear for two days. Yeah, like it's a crisis and then like and they get warmer but [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2494.8799999999997s)]
*  But when you're a teenager you don't care [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2502.72s)]
*  You don't care at all [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2507.04s)]
*  and but like [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2509.2s)]
*  as an adult it's also just like [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2511.04s)]
*  The comfort level like I used to be able to sleep on like a bag of rocks [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2513.52s)]
*  And now if i'm like if I don't have this one pillow in my arms, then the baby can't sleep [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2517.52s)]
*  So ridiculous [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2524.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, man [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2528.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, getting no getting older is interesting what we thought we looked like when we were younger is interesting [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2529.4399999999996s)]
*  And being it's amazing how much you can transpose [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2534.72s)]
*  Or share with your children, but how many things you cannot share. It's amazing how many like [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2538.16s)]
*  Lessons that we all go through but we can't [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2543.6s)]
*  There's no real clean clear way to share that to a kid so they don't have to deal with the tragedies of it [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2547.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I uh [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2552.3999999999996s)]

*  It had the handle and then the like that and then a bunch of straight prongs. It looked like a home almost [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2650.8s)]
*  It was kind of like a server and a yes a cutter. It was a multi-purpose that thing. Oh, wow [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2655.36s)]
*  That thing would take you. Yeah, what is that? [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2663.04s)]
*  What is that? That was for the cake [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2666.0s)]
*  Is that like a is that kind of like a cajun thing? Because we didn't have cake cutters like that [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2669.12s)]
*  What's all the what's all the like the fingers going down? I think you could probably play a song [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2675.2799999999997s)]
*  I mean who knows I don't know it could have had a xylophone tendencies [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2680.08s)]

*  No, the the the doin doin doin. Oh that little hand [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2688.64s)]
*  Harp [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2691.68s)]
*  What happened to that harp? I don't know. Yeah, what was that thing? What happened to snuff dude? [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2692.72s)]
*  What happened to a cute old lady in church taking a freaking hit of that tobacco powder to the dome? [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2697.2799999999997s)]
*  You know like the chewing tobacco thing. I did that. Did you do that? I never did it [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2702.0s)]
*  Yeah, I was a that was a big thing. I remember snuff. Did you do I did the copenhagen? [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2707.12s)]
*  I mean the the powder you would smell but i've tried that [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2712.96s)]
*  I tried that so like that's just sniffing tobacco. Yeah, that's gotta make a comeback [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2716.7999999999997s)]
*  I would think that would [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2722.96s)]
*  Right, because that's probably a pretty interesting high [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2724.72s)]
*  But I would think it's really bad [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2728.3999999999996s)]
*  What if we got nicotine in our brain cavity? [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2731.8399999999997s)]

*  Oh [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2742.7999999999997s)]
*  See, I thought that that was that's the same container as chewing tobacco [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2744.08s)]
*  Right. That's long cut now. That's an actual cut that you put into your lips snuff is more [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2749.68s)]
*  There's dry snuff right there. If you look click on that one one down. Yeah one down right there. Yeah [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2753.92s)]

*  And you can see that uh [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2764.72s)]

*  The snuff [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2771.2s)]
*  It's interesting because that like so copenhagen kodiak all that stuff, right? [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2773.2799999999997s)]
*  I remember when they introduced uh, the pouches or maybe the pouches were all always there and I never knew about them [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2778.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, but you know those were all started in scandinavia [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2785.9199999999996s)]
*  Because [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2791.9199999999996s)]
*  It was cold outside and it was windy so they had to [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2793.6s)]
*  how they consumed uh [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2797.68s)]
*  Tobacco was kind of chewing on it as opposed to [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2799.9199999999996s)]
*  Where you know they could light it right be easier if it was warmer out, you know [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2804.64s)]
*  I mean man people will find a way to get tobacco they need it, huh? Right a little nicotine buzz [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2809.68s)]
*  It just gets you going like it's all your or it'll make you go to the bathroom to make you stay awake if you're driving [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2815.52s)]
*  It'll kind of just get you through things you need to do [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2821.8399999999997s)]
*  People I mean my parents smoked constantly. Yeah [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2824.56s)]
*  Constantly and I mean they all I mean they died when they were 10, but like they no but they they smoked constantly [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2828.6200000000003s)]
*  and [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2836.88s)]
*  Now no one really smokes. Oh smoking is crazy [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2837.84s)]
*  Like it's it's pretty rare to see [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2841.84s)]
*  someone smoke like someone [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2845.44s)]
*  Like I remember when they outlawed smoking in bars in New York City. I was like, well, that's not gonna work [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2848.08s)]
*  and now [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2855.04s)]
*  The craziest thing would be like seeing uh, someone smoke on the subway. You're like [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2856.72s)]
*  Not only are they breaking the rules, but like they're smoking like that's just [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2863.12s)]
*  But now kids do the the vaping and that's actually worse for you, right? [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2868.24s)]
*  But it's fun and it tastes good and you can have all the flavors and it's like you can have all the different flavors you want [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2873.04s)]
*  um, but kids lungs are getting decimated because [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2880.3999999999996s)]
*  When you vape you're inhaling oil as opposed to like cigarette you were just inherent inhaling smoke, so [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2884.16s)]
*  but it's brutal because it's [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2893.2s)]
*  It is so fun and it's portable, right? It's portable. You can do it inside [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2896.0s)]
*  You can do it outside you see people on planes secretly taking a hit [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2900.08s)]
*  Yeah, you know getting gassed up. You see all types of of people doing it. Um, I worked on a movie and this girl was [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2903.7599999999998s)]
*  hammered [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2912.16s)]
*  Yeah, just constantly. I mean she was probably nervous [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2913.36s)]
*  But like, um, it makes you more nervous it does [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2917.1200000000003s)]
*  Oh, it increases your anxiety if you have no anxiety you hit that thing two hits all of a sudden [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2920.4s)]
*  You're anxious. You're scared. You're calling somebody you'll text the cops. Hey, what's up? [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2926.0s)]
*  You it creates anxiety. Do you you vape? I have been a vapor. I'll be honest. I have been a vapor [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2931.28s)]
*  I have vaped and so but like it's addictive right? You can't really get rid of it [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2937.1200000000003s)]
*  It's the most addictive thing ever you seem like you you kind of like were you always I mean vaping hasn't always been around [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2941.44s)]
*  But like when vaping came out you're like [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2948.48s)]
*  This is my joint. No, I thought it was kind of I thought it was something for that gay man did honestly at first [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2951.04s)]
*  Oh really? I thought it was but I was the same way about the iphone. I was like nobody's gonna [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2956.96s)]
*  You know, that's so funny. This is I was the same thing about twins when I saw twins for the first time [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2961.36s)]
*  I was like this isn't [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2965.68s)]
*  I remember gonna stick around. I remember when email addresses [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2967.44s)]

*  You have your name and your email address. I mean this is going back and I was like, yeah [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2980.26s)]

*  Jim gaffigan.com. He's like, why do you have a website? [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=2998.1800000000003s)]
*  And I was like, well, I think everyone is probably gonna have a website and he's like no [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=3001.7000000000003s)]

*  it was just seen as a little bit like [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=3022.82s)]
*  Unnecessary right like you're being a bit much here [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=3026.1600000000003s)]

*  Yeah a little more humanely than murder. There has to be some middle ground in there [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=3481.44s)]
*  Like did you know of anyone that got murdered in your town? [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=3485.36s)]

*  So I would have to go and live next door to the family and be helpful to them or something for the rest of my life [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=3568.96s)]

*  Well, it's like, you know when you did your last special you're like i'm gonna do this special and you kind of set your mind [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4127.5199999999995s)]
*  to it and you do it but like [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4133.52s)]
*  I think the craziest thing is like [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4136.400000000001s)]
*  when I did my first special [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4139.200000000001s)]
*  it was the expectation was that [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4142.8s)]
*  People would maybe do one or two or maybe you know, like carlin did a bunch but it was not [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4147.120000000001s)]
*  What it is now, which is [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4155.200000000001s)]
*  Where and it might change where people [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4158.320000000001s)]
*  Every couple years put out a special [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4161.6s)]
*  I don't think [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4163.6s)]
*  And that might change but like, you know, I mean here we are in this on a podcast. I mean that [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4165.12s)]
*  This didn't exist [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4170.4800000000005s)]
*  In its present form five years ago. Yeah, do you know what I mean? Yeah [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4172.4s)]
*  Where it's like people consume like there's pressure for you to do episodes because people [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4177.28s)]
*  You know, you know, they they're kind of like, all right. I need another hit, right? [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4184.64s)]

*  I mean you become an entertainer and you look forward to having the chats with people [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4194.400000000001s)]
*  You also start to realize that people in our business and and in different businesses are so busy that sometimes this is the realest chat [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4199.6s)]
*  You're going to get with them. Yeah, you know and I started to realize that recently like I went [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4206.72s)]

*  And I was like man, this is [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4217.52s)]
*  I wish I'd utilize that time a little bit more with him just to really be like, oh this is our time to connect [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4219.280000000001s)]
*  It's just that's how you know if you spend a couple hours with somebody it's a lot of time. So yeah, it's [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4224.56s)]
*  It is i'm jealous of I mean, I don't want to uh, i'm not going to start my own podcast, but I am jealous of [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4231.4400000000005s)]
*  Because you know comedians, you know, you get some success you never get to hang out with people [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4239.92s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? The more successful you are the more you [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4246.240000000001s)]
*  And if you have other aspects of your life [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4250.56s)]
*  You're not going to get the quality one-on-one time that you would normally get and just for comedians [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4253.4400000000005s)]
*  This is kind of our oxygen [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4259.76s)]
*  Is talking to other comedians. That's a good point [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4262.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think it probably used to be different you guys would hang out together more [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4265.04s)]
*  Was there more that I think all of that happens too when you're coming up as well? [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4268.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and I think there was also just there was [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4272.0s)]
*  You know, there wasn't the touring and doing theaters and which is great and I love but it was [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4275.84s)]
*  Or you know if you were doing comedy clubs, there was you know, three or four people and you'd be there for multiple nights and you knew [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4283.68s)]
*  some of the wait staff and there was uh, you know you had more of uh, [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4292.240000000001s)]
*  There was more of a communal experience, but it's all shifting constantly and that's that's true, too [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4298.64s)]
*  It changes constantly and it's scary to know if the next shift if you will apply to it [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4304.799999999999s)]
*  Right that feels very scary a lot of times if the next curve if you will have [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4310.4s)]
*  if whatever you're doing will have an ability to kind of like uh, [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4316.16s)]
*  Flourish in that space, but I think that [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4322.0s)]
*  You know, I mean we talked a little bit about this beforehand before we even saw I think [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4326.24s)]
*  Authenticity is what people crave. Yeah, and so [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4331.76s)]
*  There are things that are shiny [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4336.56s)]
*  and trendy and fancy, but [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4340.320000000001s)]
*  I think that if it's authenticity [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4343.2s)]
*  And it kind of can adjust to the times [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4346.8s)]
*  It's kind of timeless, right? Yeah, I think [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4350.8s)]
*  You know, yeah, I think you want yeah, you know, I mean it's like there's always going to be people [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4355.12s)]
*  That have that come from uh, similar backgrounds to that we have yeah [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4360.96s)]
*  Not that I know anything about you, but you're I mean, you know, I mean it's like [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4368.88s)]
*  there's you know [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4374.48s)]
*  But I don't know. I think that [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4376.56s)]
*  You know comedians we are [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4378.72s)]
*  That's kind of a litmus test among our peers is to retain that authenticity [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4381.36s)]
*  That's not to say that there isn't some fun and there isn't some pretending and there isn't oh, yeah exaggeration but [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4387.28s)]
*  you know [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4395.2s)]
*  It's also like I think when comedians buy their own hype even when you know [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4396.64s)]
*  You know like when we were joking around even like when comedians think they are good-looking [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4401.599999999999s)]
*  That's kind of the kiss of death, right when they're like, well, I am [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4405.84s)]
*  I am a philosopher. It's like well, you know, you have to be self-aware [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4410.48s)]
*  Yeah, it's scary [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4416.74s)]
*  It's kind of scary because also people you start people start telling you stuff and you have to be careful [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4417.7s)]
*  Not really to believe them. You have to just kind of know what your lane is [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4423.0599999999995s)]
*  You have to stay out of your ego. The ego is really scary. It is scary [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4426.34s)]
*  The ego is really really scary, especially I think for guys who came from low self-worth [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4430.0199999999995s)]
*  And then here's this false sense of self-worth, right or the here's this inflated. It's like this [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4436.259999999999s)]
*  Um, it's like clothing it's like this clothing. It's like oh look at me [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4442.66s)]
*  Look at what you can do, but the inside of you it doesn't really uh, it's it's not the reality [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4446.339999999999s)]
*  so yeah, man, that's been the scare that's been something scary for me is like [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4451.86s)]
*  Be trying not to hear certain things or just trying to keep my ego at bay [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4456.179999999999s)]
*  I think it's ego, but I think it's also getting for me. It's getting caught up in other people's expectations, which is [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4461.0599999999995s)]
*  It's not like a problem that you solve once it's [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4469.54s)]
*  it's uh [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4473.38s)]
*  You know like the fact that your podcast is independent, which is not [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4475.0599999999995s)]
*  Good or bad right or wrong or anything like that [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4479.3s)]
*  is like the expectation [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4482.42s)]
*  of [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4485.94s)]
*  of where [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4486.82s)]
*  What you're supposed to do with things [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4488.42s)]
*  Is usually and it's changing but like I guess what i'm saying is like the fact that rogan [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4491.38s)]
*  Is you know [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4497.860000000001s)]
*  Everyone was like, oh you're supposed to do this. You're supposed to start your own podcast company [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4499.38s)]
*  He kind of didn't get caught up in that and then ended up doing that spotify deal [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4504.34s)]
*  and it's [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4510.42s)]
*  and and I think comedians have a tendency to kind of go their own path, but [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4511.62s)]
*  For me when I sit there and I go, oh I should uh, I should do this. That's what everyone else is doing [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4517.62s)]
*  That's when I really mess up or it's like oh there's a [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4523.9400000000005s)]
*  That's a nice dollar sign, right? [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4528.02s)]
*  You know my agent said that's good money [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4530.74s)]
*  That's that's when you get in trouble. Yeah is other people's expectations rather than anyway [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4533.46s)]
*  No, no, that's a great point. What do you think? What do you think is how do we [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4540.18s)]
*  How do we [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4544.26s)]
*  How do we kind of? [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4545.46s)]
*  Or what things come into play there when we're trying to figure that out? [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4546.900000000001s)]
*  Because i'll have things like that that come across and it's like hey man, you know, this looks great [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4550.34s)]
*  This is so many thousands of dollars. I'm like that looks great that yeah, but then it's like trying to know what [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4554.66s)]
*  Trust whatever your instinct is, you know or know what your instinct is. That's really hard sometimes [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4561.22s)]
*  right to know like is this an instinct or is this a fear is this like [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4566.42s)]
*  An instinct telling me yes, or is that my ego telling me? [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4572.02s)]
*  Yes, like right starts to get weird to fucking figure those like who's like [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4574.66s)]
*  Who's at the front pointing at that moment? You know what part of you I think it's it's like, you know [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4579.94s)]
*  it's you know, I think the ego is very impulsive, right, so it's like [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4586.5s)]
*  Maybe taking time and you know, it sounds corny the pros and the cons that helps a lot. You know what I mean? And also [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4591.54s)]
*  You know, you've got this successful podcast but like also you have [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4599.459999999999s)]
*  friends [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4604.32s)]
*  and you can and you know [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4605.94s)]
*  Uh, it's just kind of like, you know, like your unique, uh sensibility [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4608.82s)]
*  is [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4614.5s)]
*  Is not something that someone could tell you how to come up with you know, I mean it's like [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4615.78s)]
*  That was on you [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4622.179999999999s)]
*  but [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4624.179999999999s)]
*  I think I think input from uh [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4625.7s)]
*  And test people and but I think also tempered [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4628.74s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like it's like kind of take all the advice and cut it in half like even when [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4632.419999999999s)]
*  people like badmouth someone I usually typically cut it in half and [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4638.259999999999s)]
*  so [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4642.98s)]
*  That's why like if I really hate someone i'm like I already cut it in half [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4644.099999999999s)]
*  All right [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4650.9s)]
*  Getting half the half the bad shit you did [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4652.98s)]
*  What um when you and gerardo were coming up with did he start off doing better than you guys were both doing? [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4656.179999999999s)]
*  Well at the same time was there a competition there like what kind of uh, that's so crazy. He was so smart, huh? [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4660.9s)]
*  He oh, he was super smart and he was [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4667.0599999999995s)]
*  also [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4670.179999999999s)]
*  You know everyone liked him. Yeah, and he would help me [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4671.86s)]
*  get in [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4676.099999999999s)]
*  To because he grew up in queens. He would help me get into clubs on long island. I was like this white bread guy [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4677.46s)]
*  You know and like on line island. They're like who's this dork? Yeah [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4684.0199999999995s)]
*  Who's this milk man? Yeah, and so [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4687.86s)]
*  Uh, he but he would help me [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4690.98s)]
*  but yeah, no he had a lot of success and I was jealous and I told him that I was jealous and uh, but [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4692.82s)]
*  you know, it's weird because [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4701.54s)]
*  You know, it's not just about [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4705.3s)]
*  the uh [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4708.099999999999s)]
*  The success I think it's like how we all process [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4710.0199999999995s)]
*  The failures like I almost feel like the advantage I had was that [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4714.58s)]
*  I had [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4721.54s)]
*  Failed in a lot of things whereas like people that were really successful [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4722.66s)]
*  In everything they didn't have kind of the appetite for it [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4728.099999999999s)]
*  You know like or the aptitude even for failure you have to have some fucking yeah [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4733.54s)]
*  And you know like some people that are allergic to cilantro. They just it they're like it tastes like soap [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4737.7s)]
*  it's like and so like failure you have to [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4743.139999999999s)]
*  have to have [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4746.74s)]
*  uh [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4748.5s)]
*  You know [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4749.86s)]
*  You know, it's like we tempered by it a little yeah [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4751.219999999999s)]
*  You have to like you have to have the calluses to deal with some of it if that makes sense [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=4753.7s)]

*  It's packed with sugar too. It's just yeah. I think it's like it's really dense. I feel like there's different [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=5038.34s)]
*  Like there's different eras of sugar [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=5045.54s)]
*  like, you know, because like [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=5049.22s)]
*  Rock candy they used to eat rock candy my mother loves it rock candy [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=5051.46s)]
*  And then like it was sugar on a little wooden pole, right? [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=5056.740000000001s)]
*  The chunk of sugar by the way, you ever had straight sugar cane [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=5060.34s)]
*  That's great. Like you just get a hunk [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=5064.34s)]
*  And I think that's not bad for you [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=5067.62s)]
*  Wow, because it's not processed. Yeah that process and really doesn't number it doesn't number on our bodies too [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=5070.5s)]
*  Yeah sugar cane that stuff is so sweet it's unreal [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=5076.34s)]
*  So, you know, here's the thing that I thought was so I did this movie peter pan where I was [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=5079.38s)]
*  Uh, I played a pirate so I kind of went down a rabbit hole learning about pirates [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=5084.9800000000005s)]
*  and [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=5090.5s)]
*  So when sugar [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=5092.26s)]
*  Became this big thing [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=5095.860000000001s)]
*  That's where so like sugar people started putting sugar in their tea [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=5099.14s)]
*  And their coffee and they put sugar in everything people love sugar and it destroyed people's teeth [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=5104.660000000001s)]
*  and so like prior to that people's teeth were fine, but like [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=5112.02s)]
*  once sugar happened [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=5116.42s)]
*  It devastated people's [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=5118.580000000001s)]
*  Uh teeth here's another interesting thing that I thought was really wild is that like the coffee break [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=5120.9800000000005s)]
*  Was created [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=5128.34s)]
*  So that people would drink coffee [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=5130.9800000000005s)]
*  Because when people drink coffee, they're more efficient [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=5134.34s)]
*  At work [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=5138.580000000001s)]
*  So they wanted people to drink coffee [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=5139.860000000001s)]
*  You know, I don't know if you drink coffee at all. Yeah, like having but like it's like you can kind of focus [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=5142.900000000001s)]
*  And you can kind of I mean it also keeps you regular but like you can focus so like they wanted people to drink coffee [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=5149.38s)]
*  Yeah, I mean some people there were women that would get rid of if they if they didn't have coffee [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=5155.860000000001s)]

*  And especially it doesn't see a lot of times that you don't feel like you're popular [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=5938.76s)]
*  You don't feel it's like you walk around thinking oh i'm up [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=5942.12s)]
*  It's like you're just kind of living your life and then there's this other realm that's kind of going on [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=5944.6s)]
*  That flares up every now and then when you're in certain instances. Yeah, and or like if you're you know, if we're eating [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=5949.96s)]
*  dinner with uh, you know [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=5956.68s)]
*  Not that we eat out really that often but like if we're eating out and someone's like comes up [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=5958.76s)]
*  That's weird. Yeah, do you know what I mean? [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=5964.92s)]
*  And it's like I don't mind it [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=5967.24s)]
*  If i'm alone or if i'm after a show and i'm in a restaurant, but if i'm with my family [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=5969.4800000000005s)]
*  It's a little weird. Yeah, because you have to take a break from that moment and then [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=5975.24s)]
*  Step out and then it's like the center of attention is you have to act like i'm nice, right? [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=5979.72s)]
*  In front of my kids and I don't like my kids seeing me be kind [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=5985.96s)]

*  Like what are the residual effects that that you don't even realize or that any popular parent [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=5993.16s)]
*  Doesn't even realize you know that a kid then [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=5998.68s)]
*  How it affects their life and then sometimes I was thinking like [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6002.2s)]

*  and then [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6321.34s)]
*  there is such a sense of [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6323.1s)]
*  Completion in finishing the hour and then I don't know. I feel like with stand-up. I'm kind of [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6327.08s)]
*  I'm getting better, you know, like there's all right, uh, you know, i'll be like, all right, i'm gonna [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6335.26s)]
*  I want to tell some stories. All right now. I want to talk about [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6341.5s)]
*  I don't want to talk about food at all, which was [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6346.14s)]
*  like another [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6349.26s)]
*  Hurdle of mine and then I was like, all right. I'm gonna talk my wife had a brain tumor [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6351.1s)]
*  I'm gonna talk about the brain tumor and then [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6354.700000000001s)]
*  um, all right, I you know, like I could just talk about my kids constantly but i'm like i'm not gonna just [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6357.9800000000005s)]
*  Because I was like that 26 year old guy sitting in a comedy club hearing people talk about their kids [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6364.540000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I can't even get a date [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6370.14s)]
*  so, um [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6372.860000000001s)]
*  you know, I mean [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6374.46s)]
*  so there's the assignment of it, but [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6375.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know there is something of [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6378.78s)]
*  Because in the weird the weird way we're doing it for ourselves, right and so [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6383.58s)]
*  When you get off stage and people are like, thank you so much. You're like, I was just doing that for myself [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6389.98s)]
*  You know, it was like I had fun, you know, it's like [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6395.099999999999s)]
*  You know, there was this there used to be this saying like doing colleges. You're not paid for the show [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6398.86s)]
*  You're paid because it's so hard to get to them [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6403.9s)]
*  Yeah, and always the worst. Yeah, and so [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6406.7s)]
*  But to answer your question, I do feel like [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6410.54s)]
*  I don't know. Yeah, I mean [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6414.22s)]
*  definitely, you know [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6417.0199999999995s)]
*  taking some time, but [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6419.74s)]
*  It is I enjoy it's the creative fulfillment. That's yeah, that's that's huge [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6422.0599999999995s)]
*  Well, that's it that's and I think I think that people that have podcasts get that that buzz [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6427.74s)]
*  And you know, it's and and I enjoy acting and I get it there but like acting so [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6433.98s)]
*  It's so erratic on when you can do it so [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6441.5s)]
*  Yeah, there's there's definitely like I think [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6447.5s)]
*  A fulfillment aspect for people like you get to the end of a of a chapter in your life [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6451.099999999999s)]
*  You don't want it. You just you challenge yourself. I don't want to talk about this anymore [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6456.219999999999s)]
*  I want to try to do it. I want to try to do it [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6459.419999999999s)]
*  I don't want to talk about this anymore. I want to try something new [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6462.0599999999995s)]
*  You also feel yourself evolving, you know, that's something I feel in my own life [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6465.5s)]
*  Sometimes you know for like some of the first time in probably forever. I've started to feel like oh man [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6468.86s)]
*  I'm evolving a little bit. I need to [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6473.099999999999s)]
*  I want to start [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6475.58s)]
*  Thinking in different patterns and talking about stuff that maybe has more [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6477.74s)]
*  Is like more thoughtful to me [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6482.22s)]
*  But then sometimes it's like you don't want to get too crazy and you want to make sure that people are just having fun [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6484.38s)]
*  You know, absolutely it's like you don't want to turn into some like, you know [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6488.78s)]
*  Guy who's just like preaching, you know, so that can be kind of a tough [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6492.62s)]
*  That can be tough a little bit sometimes to manage and I think comedians we I [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6496.7s)]
*  I think people are always so surprised at how [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6501.5s)]
*  Sincere comedians are that's not to say that we're [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6504.36s)]
*  we don't joke around and have fun, but like [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6507.58s)]
*  But we have to keep a balance on that sincerity because if we get too sincere then we're just [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6511.1s)]
*  Then we might as well just be a preacher. Yeah [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6518.46s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? Then we're like, you know the way we should do go, you know [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6521.5s)]
*  It's like we might as well just be preaching. Yeah, did you see that little kid that pentecostal kid recently? [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6525.18s)]
*  They had a kid who was doing [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6531.26s)]
*  speaking in tongues [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6533.58s)]
*  He was a young preacher [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6535.42s)]
*  Now did you growing up? Did you go to church? [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6537.74s)]
*  We would sometimes my dad would take us over there [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6540.38s)]
*  You know [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6542.86s)]
*  My dad was so old when I was young when I was a child and so he would walk over there to church [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6543.1s)]
*  And he'd fall asleep. He'd fall asleep wherever we were [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6547.1s)]
*  Yeah, and so when I got there I was kind of on my own wherever we went [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6549.42s)]
*  You know [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6552.38s)]
*  My dad was like i'll introduce you to people we'd go we'd sit down for a second till he could take a break and then [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6552.700000000001s)]
*  He'd be fucking dead asleep [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6557.5s)]
*  So then I would just be kind of like in these places and I had this sleeping father that felt uncomfortable [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6559.42s)]
*  And then I was there and had to kind of like navigate some situations that kind of stuff would happen a lot with my dad [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6566.06s)]
*  And how what kind of church was it was presbyterian? [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6572.3s)]
*  Presbyterian, yeah, they had three nice oak trees. I remember [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6575.92s)]
*  and uh, they tried to do an insurance fire once or twice, but it didn't take and [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6580.080000000001s)]
*  and um [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6585.280000000001s)]
*  Great breakfast over there though [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6587.120000000001s)]
*  Right [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6589.52s)]
*  God nothing will bring you home, you know, nothing will bring you to the lord like a dang one of those donuts with pink frosting [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6590.4800000000005s)]
*  I just think of like different churches like you remember [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6596.56s)]
*  like we went to this church, uh in maryland that [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6600.88s)]
*  Uh, just amazing you go and get pizza [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6605.2s)]
*  Donuts and you know, you're like, you know, usually a little hungover on sunday [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6609.76s)]
*  You're like [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6615.44s)]
*  This is sweet [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6616.5599999999995s)]
*  You know a little kick from that lemonade. You're like, this is perfect. Yeah, god knows what I need but [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6618.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah church was I thought the funnest thing about church was just kids playing and stuff like like a social environment [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6626.08s)]
*  Yeah, you know and it used to be that was the place you saw anybody [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6631.92s)]
*  They didn't have all this other stuff you had to you know [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6636.32s)]
*  fight off yellow fever all week and [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6638.88s)]
*  dysentery and get everybody's butts clean and everything and then [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6641.18s)]
*  Wagging them up to church and that's where you'd see somebody and hope somebody would with a little bit of money would make love to your [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6644.860000000001s)]
*  daughter or you know or [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6650.64s)]
*  You know, that's where you know, that's where it happened. It all happened right there on the you know [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6652.64s)]
*  And you know, it's like you know, there is something strange about because also I spent [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6658.400000000001s)]
*  my 20s and you know my 30s very much [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6664.88s)]
*  Opposed to it and then I married this woman that that uh is catholic and I mean I was raised catholic [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6669.84s)]
*  But kind of just kind of culturally [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6675.92s)]
*  And but there is something about [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6678.64s)]
*  There's a quietness [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6681.68s)]
*  there [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6684.400000000001s)]
*  That you know [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6685.68s)]
*  There's something meditative about it and maybe because it's so boring [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6687.52s)]
*  but it was [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6693.360000000001s)]
*  it's [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6694.72s)]
*  There is something about like oh and i'm just standing there with my kids. I'm just sitting there with my kids. It's [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6695.76s)]
*  It's like the world slows down [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6702.08s)]
*  Like I you know, you see why people go and why they have a connection to it [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6705.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I love I mean I love faith, you know, I have I feel like I have a good faith [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6711.12s)]
*  You know, I like being able to close my eyes and and I like to pray twice a day [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6715.12s)]
*  I like to be able to think about god and and and talk and or my god and ask him [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6719.36s)]
*  You know what I can do for others and just things like that or if I need help to offer me some suggestion [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6724.88s)]
*  um [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6731.76s)]
*  I love that kind of stuff [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6732.88s)]
*  I mean one of the best times ever had in my life or best I ever felt was when I felt like I had a [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6734.32s)]
*  Really strong connection to a higher power [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6738.0s)]
*  Yeah, and I'd worked on it a lot and it really came to fruition [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6740.24s)]
*  And even if some people say well, that's [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6744.34s)]
*  Voodoo, whatever it is doesn't matter. It worked it like [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6746.82s)]
*  It worked as much as as it it was real as far as I knew and if that's if that's the truth to me, then that's [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6751.94s)]
*  Great. Well, it's also you talk about you you had mentioned before ego, right? [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6759.38s)]
*  like that humility [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6765.38s)]
*  Or just a concept of humility [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6768.9s)]
*  Is so necessary right to navigate this because if you let the ego take over [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6772.2s)]
*  It's trouble, you know what I mean? And I know that yeah, I know that's to some people listening [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6779.799999999999s)]
*  And then we just sound like we're saying gobbledygook [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6784.5199999999995s)]
*  but like [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6786.92s)]
*  It is one of those like when you you know, you're somebody that [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6788.12s)]
*  If you you know, like i've struggled with my ego and stuff like that [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6791.719999999999s)]
*  it's like the only way you can get that in line is [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6796.679999999999s)]
*  having some humility and like [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6801.719999999999s)]
*  And the premise of religion that or belief system that there's a higher power [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6804.679999999999s)]
*  Is is very kind of [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6811.24s)]

*  I'm well, i'm willing to try this [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6910.36s)]
*  And then it opens up more of a door for me of like um of connection. Does that make any sense? Yes [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6913.08s)]

*  is [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6928.68s)]
*  That's that's just where you gotta be. You know, I mean it's like [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6930.2s)]
*  It's like I don't [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6934.68s)]
*  you know, I think that human beings [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6936.6s)]
*  are so arrogant [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6939.64s)]
*  and [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6941.64s)]
*  The assumption that like every generation has thought that they've had it figured out [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6942.44s)]
*  And every generation has been wrong. Yeah, do you know what I mean? Like [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6947.8s)]
*  Even you know, so it's like [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6952.52s)]
*  If we can't be like we don't know [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6955.48s)]
*  Then we're really kind of starting from a bad position [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6960.12s)]
*  So, yeah, dude [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6964.36s)]
*  I don't know if how do you think you'd have been like a good like if you go back to those times you go on a [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6965.48s)]
*  Date like would you have been like a good settler you think where would you have best done in history? [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6969.799999999999s)]
*  Where would you have best been? Yeah, gosh [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6973.879999999999s)]
*  I sometimes think about like my immigrant ancestors because you know [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6977.32s)]
*  Ma I did that finding your roots show. I haven't seen that so, uh, [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6982.759999999999s)]
*  That's where they they kind of they do you did that where they take you to the library? [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6987.719999999999s)]
*  Well, no mine was uh [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6993.08s)]
*  Where they kind of like tracked my mother's side my father's side [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=6996.6s)]
*  And did you have to go meet someone at a mall or anything? No, no, I didn't this was uh [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7000.76s)]
*  But like so my grandfather [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7007.72s)]
*  Made dentures and I remember thinking oh it made dentures [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7012.200000000001s)]
*  That's interesting. You know like yeah [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7016.6s)]
*  dental stuff and [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7019.16s)]
*  But what I learned through that show is that my grandfather broke this cycle of working in the coal mine [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7021.5599999999995s)]
*  That had existed for generations [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7031.0s)]
*  and so [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7034.2s)]
*  I think of like my ancestors that came over from ireland, you know [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7035.5599999999995s)]
*  and just like [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7041.88s)]
*  That was that was rough [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7043.8s)]
*  And you know like there's an ancestor that was framed for murder [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7046.4400000000005s)]
*  Oh, and how would you even prove you didn't do it back then like you did? Well, by the way, I think [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7050.2s)]
*  because he was uh, they you know, it was kind of theorized that he was a [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7055.64s)]
*  um kind of like there was this anti-immigrant stuff going on and being an irish immigrant [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7061.320000000001s)]
*  That he was part of the molly maguires and so they framed him [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7068.2s)]
*  And then they kind of he got pardoned by the governor [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7072.200000000001s)]
*  And they don't know, you know, like they never explained why he was pardoned, you know [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7077.160000000001s)]
*  Was he pardoned because he was innocent was he pardoned because he was crooked? [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7081.240000000001s)]
*  Because he was crooked, you know, and so [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7086.4400000000005s)]
*  But like yeah, so like a different era. I feel like i'm so pale that [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7090.04s)]
*  You know like I need sunscreen. Yeah, even by a computer, huh? Yeah open in the fridge [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7095.160000000001s)]
*  So I yeah, that's got to be the saddest dude if you're real pale because then if you open the fridge everybody sees you too [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7101.88s)]
*  Yeah [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7108.6s)]
*  It's like bigger and pale and so no, but like I mean, it's not sad. It's beautiful, but it's like [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7109.64s)]
*  What era would you be? [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7115.88s)]
*  I don't know. The future seems way sketch, you know [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7119.56s)]
*  It's just I feel like gonna be people like [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7122.280000000001s)]
*  You drive up to a machine that feeds you and then you come into it. Yeah [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7124.6s)]
*  It would but it has to be in the past [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7128.84s)]
*  Civil war could have been interesting right? [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7131.72s)]
*  And if you would have been like a referee, I think [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7134.52s)]
*  Yeah, I mean civil war but like people were just so many people were killed like the the equipment [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7137.320000000001s)]
*  Uh, like the the weapons were so yeah, it's like they and it's like you got shot [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7145.0s)]
*  They just chop off your leg. You know what I mean? Yeah, they didn't even have to be shot in the leg [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7151.96s)]
*  Yeah [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7156.84s)]
*  Yeah, they had yeah some of their tech. Yeah, a lot of their technical skills are way limited. It's yeah [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7158.68s)]
*  Whereas I think like like if some people even if they had just had like down syndrome [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7165.0s)]
*  They're like, oh he got shot by something like no this guy [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7168.92s)]
*  He's fine. Yeah, he's fine [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7171.88s)]
*  He's just over here raking leaves. Let this guy leave him alone [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7174.52s)]
*  Um, I think there was a lot of stuff like that. Yeah, like but I don't know maybe but then I don't know [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7179.4800000000005s)]
*  You're right people smelled so bad [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7184.04s)]
*  I don't know if I would want to be a pilgrim because you're like, well, we're almost there and everybody's dying and then you get there [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7186.12s)]
*  You have nothing to do. There's nobody even [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7191.0s)]
*  Waiting when you get there. I do think that the south is really fascinating. I know you're you know [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7193.16s)]

*  that is [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7214.76s)]
*  so [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7217.08s)]
*  different from the midwest where i'm from [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7218.36s)]
*  but [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7221.719999999999s)]

*  That [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7229.719999999999s)]
*  Is kind of unique, you know, it's kind of this [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7231.4s)]
*  Remnants of the british thing with like the sweet tea versus the british drinking tea [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7235.64s)]
*  Yeah, there's kind of an old traditionalism there that really comes through. I mean, there's also tons of racism [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7242.200000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I mean if you get it, it's a it's a little slave you get into mississippi. It's a little slavy, you know [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7246.68s)]
*  But that that kindness is fascinating. Yeah, right? [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7252.04s)]
*  Yeah, that's the crazy part about the south it had this like it also it had like two whole different ends of the spectrum, you know [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7255.64s)]
*  It was like be a gentleman be polite [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7262.52s)]
*  But if you're black you're not allowed to come in yeah [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7265.8s)]

*  It's really crazy to think that as humans where we sit today [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7275.160000000001s)]
*  It's it's like it's pretty unreal [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7278.76s)]
*  And when how quickly we fucking got to the place where we're just sitting here [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7282.280000000001s)]
*  You know, um masturbating into a phone [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7286.12s)]
*  Right well also like the so we look at the bigotry or the bias of the past [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7289.56s)]
*  What biases exist today [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7297.88s)]
*  That are the equivalent to [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7302.2s)]
*  You know women couldn't vote until 1920, you know, uh [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7305.56s)]
*  Really african americans couldn't freely vote until the 60s [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7310.92s)]
*  And so like it's like what what kind of [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7315.24s)]
*  It's not like we're done. You know, I mean like there's some biases [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7320.599999999999s)]

*  The future looks at things [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7394.2s)]
*  Yeah, or how they even choose to look at things as like writers of articles and this and that you could be vilified [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7396.2s)]
*  Well, I mean I think even the rosa and thing that happened on your podcast. Yeah is [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7403.16s)]
*  I mean, maybe i'm just kind of opening my eyes a little bit to it but like [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7409.32s)]
*  It literally took me two seconds. So I saw she was trending [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7414.28s)]
*  saw what she said then I watched the clip and I was like, it's obviously she was [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7418.36s)]
*  joking [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7423.46s)]
*  She was being sarcastic [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7424.759999999999s)]
*  Why didn't [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7426.92s)]
*  And I don't even know that's all I know like I didn't talk to anyone else about it. Does it still exist? [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7428.599999999999s)]
*  As an issue. No [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7435.32s)]
*  No, it was going away. It was just yeah [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7437.5599999999995s)]
*  It was just crazy [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7439.96s)]
*  They just like they took our episode down and they said that we they gave us like a strike on our channel because they have like [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7440.839999999999s)]
*  Like but they retracted it, right? [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7447.32s)]
*  They didn't but they have their policies and we couldn't post for like a week [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7449.4s)]
*  So those you know, that's youtube and their policies they deemed it like hate speech and that's their [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7453.24s)]
*  That's their rules, right? [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7458.759999999999s)]
*  And so that's you know, i'm grateful to youtube because I get to have this this platform at the same time [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7460.84s)]
*  I I don't uh, you know, I disagree with them [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7466.2s)]
*  but I think that anyone that [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7469.4s)]
*  Uh, and and you know, that's where it's like, you know any individual who works at youtube [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7473.0s)]
*  Would probably as an individual see that [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7478.84s)]
*  What you know rossianne a legendary comedian? [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7483.08s)]
*  And what she was saying was [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7486.84s)]
*  And I think she's jewish [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7489.48s)]
*  would not [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7491.639999999999s)]
*  view that as [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7493.8s)]
*  what [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7495.96s)]
*  Some anti-semitic person would say yeah, do you know what I mean? Oh, yeah [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7497.72s)]
*  Yeah, totally [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7502.5199999999995s)]
*  I mean it was it definitely was interesting though. I got him some some rabbi emailed me and invited me to some summer camp or something [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7503.72s)]
*  And uh, but it was like eleven hundred dollars. I'm not going on that and then [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7510.84s)]
*  Of course the holocaust happened like who would ever [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7515.64s)]
*  You know every third book at the airport is about it. How you know i'm saying, of course it happened [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7518.6s)]
*  Well, I think it's also, uh, you know not to excuse the overreaction, but [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7523.88s)]
*  I actually do think that [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7530.12s)]
*  There is um [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7532.92s)]
*  uh [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7535.48s)]
*  Uh an almost normalizing of anti-semitic speech and I also think that [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7536.84s)]
*  And i'm not saying because it's different when it's rossianne bar [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7543.16s)]
*  and uh [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7547.72s)]
*  And like someone who is just a flat-out [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7549.24s)]
*  anti-semite or like [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7553.38s)]
*  speaking in anti-semitic tropes, it's like I do think it's [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7555.4s)]
*  you know [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7560.5199999999995s)]
*  There's no comparing what? [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7561.8s)]
*  uh rossianne said to [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7564.6s)]
*  What these other people would do right if there's like a real hateful person [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7567.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I mean and by the way, I think anti-semitism is like [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7571.08s)]
*  I mean look, you know [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7575.400000000001s)]
*  Most like i'll have [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7577.72s)]
*  I don't know what percentage of comedians are jewish, but it's like all our friends are jewish and it's like you can't [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7580.04s)]
*  you know [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7587.08s)]
*  You know you you you know standard comedy is a jewish american art form that like [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7588.28s)]
*  Is you know? [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7594.44s)]
*  So many of the great comedians were jewish. So it's like you have you end up being educated on [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7596.5199999999995s)]
*  Anti-semitism and you can't do a spot at the cellar without hearing three comedians [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7602.66s)]
*  Do jokes about the jewish american experience in anti-semitism. You know, I mean it's like [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7608.2s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7614.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I I wish I had a like I can't tell if [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7616.28s)]
*  people bringing light to that [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7621.639999999999s)]
*  Creates [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7625.48s)]
*  makes things [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7627.32s)]
*  Better or worse in that space, right? [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7629.24s)]
*  You know because no one said anything about it like, you know a million people had watched the video [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7631.719999999999s)]
*  There wasn't even a comment about it on youtube, right? And then somebody makes a clip [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7635.719999999999s)]
*  And purposely like is like hey look at this right and this is yeah the view of it [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7640.04s)]
*  I you know, you don't want to create like a boy who cried wolf situation either [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7645.24s)]
*  so that's you know, especially when it's something as important as like um [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7649.4s)]
*  as people being hateful, you know, it's like you don't yeah, that's so some of that is where some of my fear comes in like [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7654.04s)]
*  Let's yeah, we don't want people to become numb to it. Right? [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7662.2s)]
*  Right. So but then also, you know, everybody has their their their different thoughts on it and and I respect different people's thoughts on it [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7665.88s)]
*  You know, I respect that people come from different places and and I respect different people's thoughts on it. Um [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7673.0s)]
*  but yeah, um [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7679.56s)]
*  Dude, I have a problem with how we [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7681.32s)]
*  With that we keep putting joe biden out there. I feel like as a nation it makes us look like oh, this is how [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7684.12s)]
*  And that we pretend everything is okay [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7691.8s)]
*  Like doesn't that seem weird to you? Yeah. Well, I mean [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7694.28s)]
*  i'm somebody like I think that [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7697.8s)]
*  if [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7701.32s)]
*  Trump wasn't there [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7702.28s)]
*  Or maybe i'm just imagining this. I think if trump wasn't there [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7704.36s)]
*  Biden would be like i'm done. Thanks everyone [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7708.36s)]
*  You know what I mean? I wanted to be done. Good night. Do you know what I mean? [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7711.24s)]

*  Yeah, and I don't but I don't know maybe he is like, uh, you know, i'm great but [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7753.240000000001s)]
*  I think it's fast. I'm trying to write this thing all about how [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7759.72s)]
*  I mean I saw harrison ford in um [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7764.52s)]

*  and [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7776.280000000001s)]
*  it's like [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7777.320000000001s)]
*  You know 80 for brady it's like they're all 80. Yeah [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7780.04s)]

*  but I just feel like if we like if [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7789.96s)]
*  Maybe the media was like this is our guy. He's gonna say some shit, you know [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7792.76s)]
*  Instead of I feel like we put this like people try to pretend that it's that he's not [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7797.56s)]
*  Getting unwell. That's the part to me that does it look weird to other people if it's like this is how we treat our senior citizens [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7801.96s)]
*  You know like as well. It's not how we treat. I mean, I think it's like I thought your point would be more like [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7808.76s)]
*  everything is fine like we're living in a state of denial, but I also felt that like [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7814.68s)]
*  During the entire pandemic when trump would do his daily [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7820.52s)]
*  Newscast that we were all like, yeah, it'll be fine. It'll be fine. It's like this guy is [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7824.92s)]

*  But I also feel I don't know. It's weird. I I you know, I really do think that [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7837.8s)]

*  Didn't it feel like that? I feel like it. I mean I used to [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7874.76s)]
*  It was so strange because I grew up in this small town [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7879.240000000001s)]
*  indiana is a very red state and [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7883.88s)]
*  Uh, I lived in manhattan. I live in manhattan and that's very blue and [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7887.320000000001s)]
*  In the entertainment industry, it's very liberal [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7893.8s)]
*  and comedians are very [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7898.2s)]
*  contrarian [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7900.5s)]
*  and so [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7901.72s)]
*  I loved I relish [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7903.16s)]
*  having friends of [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7906.28s)]
*  Different opinions like at the fourth of july. I had a friend there who was [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7908.28s)]
*  a big kind of conservative like [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7912.76s)]
*  You know, he's you know, he's all in on desantis and then I had [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7917.48s)]
*  a friend there that was [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7922.200000000001s)]
*  you know that [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7924.6s)]
*  wouldn't vote for [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7926.04s)]
*  You know vote for hillary, you know, I mean so left like occupied wall street left [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7928.52s)]
*  And so it's like I like that diversity of opinion [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7934.76s)]
*  But and I and I feel like people that come to my shows [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7939.320000000001s)]
*  um [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7943.400000000001s)]
*  like even in uh, the dark pale thing I have this [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7944.68s)]
*  This material on global warming and you know when I performed it around the country there'd be some people that are like [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7948.84s)]
*  all right [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7956.04s)]
*  global warming maybe you know what I mean, whereas [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7957.4s)]
*  Like they're going they're giving me the they're like, all right. I don't know if I buy the premise, right? [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7961.0s)]
*  But i'm gonna have i'll listen to the jokes. Yeah, and so [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7966.84s)]
*  uh, I liked that [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7971.72s)]
*  they're open to that but um [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7974.599999999999s)]
*  There is also [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7978.2s)]
*  I don't know. It's weird. I know i'm kind of rambling. No, it's okay [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7981.0s)]
*  And we can even take that part out if we felt like it was too rambly if we for both of us kind of you know [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7985.24s)]
*  Um, let's take a little bit of news and then we'll get you out of here jim [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7990.12s)]
*  Because your special is coming out in a few days and the name of it is [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7993.96s)]
*  dark pale dark pale, oh [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=7998.04s)]
*  dark pale [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=8000.92s)]
*  That would be your native. That would be your indian name, huh? Dark pale dark pale dark pale [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=8002.36s)]
*  Uh, yeah, so it's uh, I you know, it's kind of I wanted to go a little bit [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=8007.88s)]
*  You know, I think comedians [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=8014.2s)]
*  Uh, you know our onstage personas are a little bit more accessible [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=8016.4400000000005s)]
*  And that maybe you know, like what makes comedians laugh when we hang out is usually darker [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=8022.2s)]
*  Than what's on stage? [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=8029.56s)]
*  and so it's kind of opening some of that up [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=8031.72s)]
*  And also talking and I think that over the past five years we've gone through so much darkness, you know [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=8035.8s)]
*  We've all lost someone [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=8043.0s)]
*  lost some people, you know what I mean and um [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=8045.4s)]
*  So there's a little dose of nihilism that I think we need I think we need right? Yeah [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=8049.08s)]
*  You know, some people think we need a war [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=8056.2s)]
*  Really? Yeah [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=8058.82s)]
*  Oh, that's so interesting. Where'd you hear that? [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=8061.08s)]
*  Everywhere [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=8064.04s)]
*  We need a war because they think it would put people back on the same side [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=8066.4400000000005s)]
*  If we had a common enemy [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=8071.4800000000005s)]
*  Wow [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=8074.76s)]
*  That's interesting because there is part of like what's gonna get us together [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=8078.360000000001s)]
*  And I hope as soon as somebody says hey, it's us against them. It's like, all right, let's do this, you know [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=8083.56s)]
*  Yeah, I think that [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=8090.360000000001s)]
*  I I don't know. I mean just interesting. I think I think coming from this split [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=8092.599999999999s)]
*  background of [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=8098.58s)]
*  You know, uh [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=8100.679999999999s)]
*  You know, I have real resentment when people talk about the middle of the country or flyover states. Yeah, me too [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=8102.92s)]
*  it's like I think that [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=8109.5599999999995s)]
*  That has to be shamed for the stupidity that it is [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=8112.92s)]
*  because [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=8117.4s)]
*  Um [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=8119.48s)]
*  You know again we were talking about the it's not like you're not going to get a great meal [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=8121.0s)]
*  You know, I mean like there's this [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=8126.28s)]
*  there's this um [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=8128.28s)]
*  This dismissive stereotype and you'd think it would shrink with the internet, but I feel like it's almost kind of grown [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=8130.52s)]
*  Where people are just I always think it's so weird when I do [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=8137.56s)]
*  I'll do like a podcast or i'll be [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=8142.36s)]
*  Interviewed and someone will be like so is it different doing material in different parts of the country? I'm like not really [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=8144.68s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? It's like [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=8151.56s)]
*  It's not really that different [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=8153.24s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? It's not like people don't have [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=8156.12s)]
*  Every piece of technology or every form of entertainment. Yeah everywhere culturally. We're very [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=8159.56s)]
*  Uh, it's and by the way, the world is like that. It's like if anything culture is disappearing. So [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=8168.12s)]
*  There that's not to say that there aren't different viewpoints on things [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=8174.6s)]
*  Uh, I don't mean to contradict myself earlier, but like it's not like there's [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=8179.16s)]
*  a real huge difference [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=8184.12s)]
*  On right like from here to there. Yeah, right, you know [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=8187.32s)]
*  But I guess I mean there's some like I know whenever i've been in like illinois and certain places out there rural areas [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=8191.0s)]
*  They don't even have 5g on their phone [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=8197.64s)]
*  So it's like if they want it's like more of a they have to be at home and be on their wi-fi [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=8199.88s)]
*  To really be milling on their phones as much, you know [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=8205.24s)]
*  Oh really? [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=8208.2s)]
*  Um, like some of my friends that work in like farming communities and stuff like that [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=8208.92s)]
*  So I think in some areas there's probably a little bit less consumption [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=8212.2s)]
*  Oh, yeah. No where we uh, we have a place that we got [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=8217.08s)]
*  after the pandemic and [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=8221.48s)]
*  If i'm outside working in my garden, I have no service whatsoever. Yeah [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=8224.44s)]

*  I was with my 10 year old [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=8802.22s)]
*  And we were with a friend and my 10 year old spilled this big bucket of popcorn [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYo9gE0qs4&t=8804.94s)]
