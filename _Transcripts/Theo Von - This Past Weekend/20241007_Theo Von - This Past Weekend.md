*  I'm really excited about spending time today with Mr. Sean O'Brien. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=45.0s)]
*  Shine that light on me. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=51.28s)]

*  And I will find a song I will sing as I go. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=66.28s)]
*  And I'll be moving way too slow. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=72.28s)]
*  I've never been in a union, I don't think. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=79.28s)]
*  What about SAG-AFTRA? You did some acting. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=81.28s)]
*  Oh yeah, that's right. I had to get in SAG-AFTRA one time. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=83.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=86.28s)]
*  Yeah, so I guess I was in that union. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=87.28s)]
*  We tried to, I used to work at a pizza joint and one guy was getting fired and we're like, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=88.28s)]
*  you can't fire, if you fire him, you got to fire all of us, you know? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=94.28s)]
*  That's what it's all about. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=97.28s)]
*  And the guy, he just fired all of us. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=98.28s)]
*  And he was right actually, Mr. Wayne, he was the owner and he was right, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=100.28s)]
*  we were horrible workers, we were drinking and just deep frying everything in there. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=103.28s)]
*  That shouldn't be a termable offense. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=109.28s)]
*  I like your attitude. We needed you. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=112.28s)]
*  Sean O'Brien, you're president of the Teamsters Union, right? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=115.28s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=120.28s)]
*  Is that the term? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=121.28s)]
*  Yes, it's International Brotherhood of Teamsters. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=122.28s)]
*  Okay, and what is a Teamster? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=124.28s)]
*  Well, Teamsters started out traditional trucking, truck drivers. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=126.28s)]
*  There were horse and buggies back in the day and then evolved into trucking and then we've evolved into, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=129.28s)]
*  we represent everybody from airline pilots to zookeepers and everybody in between. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=134.28s)]
*  So it's not just a trucking union. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=138.28s)]
*  Our largest employer is United Parcel Service, represents 340,000 Teamsters nationwide. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=140.28s)]
*  United Parcel Service? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=146.28s)]
*  Yeah, UPS. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=147.28s)]
*  Okay, UPS. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=148.28s)]
*  You know, we do all the, provide all the transportation needs for motion pictures, trade shows, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=149.28s)]
*  public sector. We're pretty diverse in La Junion, 1.3 million members nationwide and in Canada. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=154.28s)]
*  In the Teamsters Union? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=160.28s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=161.28s)]
*  And so they got, so it was a team of horses, that's why the name is... [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=162.28s)]
*  Yeah, horse and buggies, yeah. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=165.28s)]
*  Yeah? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=167.28s)]
*  Yeah, they had teams pulling horses and buggies. We've been around since 1903. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=168.28s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=171.28s)]
*  So you can see how transportation has changed over the years, but you know, it's a great organization. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=172.28s)]
*  I'm fourth generation Teamster. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=179.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=181.28s)]
*  Oh, so you're, and are you the first president of your family that was ever in? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=182.28s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. All my family members, just rank and file members went to work every day. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=186.28s)]
*  I started out in a construction yard in Boston, a rigging company hauling cranes around, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=190.28s)]
*  and I just moved up the ladder, became a shop steward, and became a business agent for Local 25 in Boston and just kept moving along. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=195.28s)]
*  Nice, dude. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=204.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=205.28s)]
*  And a union is what? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=206.28s)]
*  A union is, you know, we represent working people. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=207.28s)]
*  We make sure we collectively bargain for our members, we make certain that we protect them in the workplace, process all their grievances, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=211.28s)]
*  but more importantly organize workers throughout the country that want to be unionized, and we've been very successful doing that, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=219.28s)]
*  and we just want to represent working people. We're at 1.3 million right now. Hopefully we'll be 2 million in the near future. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=226.28s)]
*  Amen. And yeah, because I know unions are responsible for the work week, right? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=232.28s)]
*  Right. So unions base 40 hour work week. Look, the unions have set the bar. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=239.28s)]
*  Even non-union people benefit when you organize, and we've organized in every industry, but we're responsible for, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=245.28s)]
*  over time we're responsible for the 40 hour work week. We're responsible for the weekend. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=253.28s)]
*  Oh, thanks, dude. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=257.28s)]
*  A lot of people don't know that, you know, so. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=258.28s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, thank you. Well. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=260.28s)]
*  But if we do have to work the weekend, we're going to get double time. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=263.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=265.28s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=266.28s)]
*  And now, didn't they just make a law that it's going to be over, it won't get taxed? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=267.28s)]
*  Well, that's a campaign promise from President Trump, I believe. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=272.28s)]
*  Oh, so it's just, it's not a definite. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=276.28s)]
*  So, you know, as you know, promises sometimes don't come to fruition, so. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=277.28s)]
*  But it is recorded, so we'll use it against whoever said it. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=280.28s)]
*  How pivotal is our unions in the American industry? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=285.28s)]
*  Look, we built the middle class. We built America. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=289.28s)]
*  Fortunately, as you know, once big business gets involved, private equity of the world or this big money to be made, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=293.28s)]
*  everybody forgets, they get amnesia on who actually is responsible. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=299.28s)]
*  And there was such a decline in the 80s because, you know, politicians put in some bad regulation. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=303.28s)]
*  I mean, I can speak for the team since they passed trucking deregulation. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=309.28s)]
*  And if I put the numbers to it, we had 400,000 members alone just in the freight industry. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=312.28s)]
*  And when they passed trucking deregulation, we lost 400,000 members. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=318.28s)]
*  Companies went bankrupt and pension funds took a hit. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=322.28s)]
*  So what happened, though? Like when they say deregulation, what do you mean by it? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=326.28s)]
*  Well, you know, the whole industry was regulated. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=330.28s)]
*  So every company had rates that they had to adhere to. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=332.28s)]
*  OK, had to follow a certain set of rules. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=335.28s)]
*  And then once deregulation passed, it was a race to the bottom. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=337.28s)]
*  And, you know, unfortunately, that that hurt us over three or four decades. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=340.28s)]
*  And now there's such a there's such a opportunity because there's so much corporate greed out there. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=344.28s)]
*  Where these white collar crime syndicates known as corporate America are just all they care about is the bottom line of their balance sheet. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=351.28s)]
*  And, you know, we've been fighting hard for the last four or five years to expose how greedy these CEOs, these corporations are, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=358.28s)]
*  but also how corruptible the political system is. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=365.28s)]
*  You know, it's funny, you know, before you always had Democrats fighting for working people and, you know, Republicans. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=368.28s)]
*  Now we kind of see a switch where working people feel like, number one, they've been left behind by the Democratic Party to, you know, the Republicans say they want to be working class, represent the working class. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=375.28s)]
*  They have an opportunity to do it. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=387.28s)]
*  But, you know, I think we've got a huge opportunity to organize and we've been exposing them and we've been fighting. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=389.28s)]
*  And, you know, our biggest our biggest opponent right now is Amazon. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=394.28s)]
*  We're going to crush them. Oh, because Amazon, my mom drives is an Amazon worker. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=398.28s)]
*  Is she? Yeah. So she's an independent contractor. She drives for them. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=403.28s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. She delivers stuff for Amazon. So I'll tell you the difference, right? Okay. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=407.28s)]
*  You look at our UPS drivers, we just negotiated the largest collective bargaining agreement. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=412.28s)]
*  UPS is the largest teams to contract in the country. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=416.28s)]
*  They're a very difficult company to deal with. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=420.28s)]
*  However, our drivers are direct employees, our members are direct employees of UPS. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=422.28s)]
*  And once you're through a four year progression as a driver, you're making almost $50 an hour free, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=428.28s)]
*  full medical and a pension that you could actually retire off of. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=433.28s)]
*  And Amazon hides behind an independent contractor model where they pay their drivers about $19.50 to $20 per hour. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=437.28s)]
*  That's the difference. Oh, yeah. So what we're doing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=445.28s)]
*  Well, as she should. Yeah, she brought her ass into this world. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=449.28s)]
*  Yeah, you got to pay the tariff. Yeah. You don't want to piss your mother off. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=453.28s)]
*  Believe me, I got a strong Irish Catholic mother who brought up her three younger brothers in a housing project in Boston. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=456.28s)]
*  And she had three just like me. Oh, and you know, she's the toughest, toughest one I know. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=462.28s)]
*  That's the only person I'm afraid of. Or really, be honest with you. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=468.28s)]
*  Really? In Boston? Yeah. It's like, oh, some of the women in Boston, dude. I got to, yeah. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=471.28s)]
*  But my mother's like petting a python. You know, at any given moment, she's going to squeeze the life out of you. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=475.28s)]
*  But I love and respect her. Oh, for sure. And she's the best. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=480.28s)]
*  And if a mouse goes missing around her. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, you know, you get the head nod. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=483.28s)]
*  The problem, you know, you get the head nod from my mother. It's like she'll go, oh, nice. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=487.28s)]
*  And nod. Done. You're done. That's it. You're done. Yeah. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=492.28s)]
*  It's like someone put a hit on you. Yeah, my mother. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=496.28s)]
*  Yeah, she delivers for Amazon. Yeah, I don't know how many hours a week she works, but she delivers for Amazon. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=502.28s)]
*  How hard is it to get a group of workers to unionize like at a company that's already like pre-existing like that? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=507.28s)]
*  Well, we're doing it right now. Like so Amazon hides behind this bullshit independent contractor model. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=512.28s)]
*  So they'll third party leasing arrangement with a company probably what your mom's working for. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=518.28s)]
*  And they try and say that they're not employees. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=523.28s)]
*  We just want a big case in California where it's called joint employer, where it's a masquerade, where Amazon controls the other company. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=527.28s)]
*  Amazon dictates the rules. Amazon dictates who where you buy your vehicles and everything else. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=535.28s)]
*  But they don't take any responsibility when the shit hits the fan. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=540.28s)]
*  So we actually won that case recently and we're organizing all over the place. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=544.28s)]
*  But what we're doing is we're striking for recognition. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=549.28s)]
*  We're going in there, get the majority of authorization cards signed by folks like your mom. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=552.28s)]
*  And then we just strike them and hold them out. And it's working. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=556.28s)]
*  We've got because of that victory we had with exposing Amazon with the independent contractor scam, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=560.28s)]
*  we get the potential to organize your mom and 300,000 other people. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=566.28s)]
*  So we've allocated tremendous funding to do this. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=571.28s)]
*  And look, Amazon, the one thing about the Teamsters Union and us, we're not good looking clearly. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=576.28s)]
*  But we don't have the deep pockets, but we've got fight, we've got intestinal fortitude, and we're not afraid. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=582.28s)]
*  We're not afraid to lose because we're supposed to lose anyways, right? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=593.28s)]
*  When you're not afraid to lose, you got nothing to lose. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=596.28s)]
*  And it's important because we set these industry standards negotiating these contracts. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=599.28s)]
*  So people like your mother's people that are unorganized will see the value of becoming a union member. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=605.28s)]
*  And look, there's always people that have something to say no matter what, you know, you're doing great. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=610.28s)]
*  You have a great show, tremendous success. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=615.28s)]
*  There's going to be someone that is jealous and doesn't just want to attack you. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=617.28s)]
*  And we're trying to change that philosophy. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=622.28s)]
*  We're trying to change that image. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=624.28s)]
*  And look, we're out there just want to help people. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=627.28s)]
*  We want to take on schoolyard bullies and we want to put them on their knees, you know? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=629.28s)]
*  Oh, I hope you take the kneecaps off some of these perverts, dude. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=632.28s)]
*  You know, that's how I really feel. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=636.28s)]
*  And also a lot of these like a lot of the tech industry came along and just because they're an app or they're a website, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=638.28s)]
*  they act like they're not an employer, I guess. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=644.28s)]
*  Oh, that's the biggest scam in the world. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=647.28s)]
*  You got Uber, you got Lyft, you've got Google, you've got all these tech companies. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=648.28s)]
*  And the sad part is, you know, these politicians that claim to be out there fighting for work and people are bought and fucking sold by these companies. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=653.28s)]
*  Oh, it's crazy. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=663.28s)]
*  It's disgusting. I love it because my job is, and again, I'm wearing the shirt, right? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=664.28s)]
*  Because we are fucking fighting with everybody. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=669.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=671.28s)]
*  And we have to because, you know, we have to be someone's conscience and that's we're going to be their conscience. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=672.28s)]
*  These big tech companies. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=677.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=679.28s)]
*  How does the team for afford attorneys and stuff to be able to fight those battles like? [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=680.28s)]
*  Well, we, you know, we have members pay dues. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=686.28s)]
*  OK. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=688.28s)]
*  So, you know, the dues, the dues money, obviously, finance as a whole operation. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=689.28s)]
*  And, you know, we are financially secure. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=694.28s)]
*  We have four hundred million dollars in a strike and defense fund, which means that we can strike and, you know, we can support a long term strike, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=696.28s)]
*  but also defend against any threat to the organization that all comes from dues money. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=704.28s)]
*  Hell, yeah. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=709.28s)]
*  And, you know, that's how we afford it. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=710.28s)]
*  It's like newsies. You ever seen newsies? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=712.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=713.28s)]
*  I don't want to tell anybody. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=714.28s)]
*  Don't tell anybody we saw it, but we saw it. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=715.28s)]
*  But it was about a strike. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=717.28s)]
*  I just don't want to admit it. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=718.28s)]
*  Yeah, I feel. Yeah. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=719.28s)]
*  It's like a couple of those, you know, ABC after school specials you watch, but you don't want to admit you watched and liked them. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=721.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=728.28s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, yeah. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=729.28s)]
*  We're supposed to have a big tough attitude as teams. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=730.28s)]
*  So, oh, for sure, dude. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=733.28s)]
*  Speaking of strikes and stuff recently, they have. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=735.28s)]
*  So right now they are all the longshoremen are striking. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=737.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=739.28s)]
*  They are from the top of Maine, I think, to the foothold in Texas. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=740.28s)]
*  OK. And what is that about? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=744.28s)]
*  It's about, you know, it's like anything else. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=746.28s)]
*  You know, longshoremen provide goods and services. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=748.28s)]
*  So imports and exports coming in. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=750.28s)]
*  They work in the they work on the dock. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=752.28s)]
*  They work in the ports in the docks. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=754.28s)]
*  Like James J. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=755.28s)]
*  Braddock like that. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=756.28s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=757.28s)]
*  And, you know, they work their contract expired the other night, but they've they've their last contract was settled in October of 2018. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=758.28s)]
*  So, you know, they worked through the pandemic. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=769.28s)]
*  There's longshoremen that lost their lives is longshoremen that, you know, can never go back to work because of the ill effects of covid. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=772.28s)]
*  But they were out there in the trenches, you know, providing goods and service when supply chain was basically almost coming to a stop. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=778.28s)]
*  And all these shipping lines, like every all these big corporations benefited, benefited off them being there. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=784.28s)]
*  Yeah. And it's like, you know, let's let's reward the people that made us a success. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=790.28s)]
*  Let's reward the people that provided goods and services country. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=794.28s)]
*  Let's reward the people that risk their lives and the safety of their families to go to work so that we all have everything. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=796.28s)]
*  Now it's their time. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=802.28s)]
*  Their contract expired. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=803.28s)]
*  These shipping lines are making gazillions of dollars and they want what's due to them. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=805.28s)]
*  And, you know, it's funny you see this criticism online. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=810.28s)]
*  And, you know, social media is great, but it's all it's just a lot of fake shit's on there. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=812.28s)]
*  And it's I'm reading it this morning and looking at it this morning. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=818.28s)]
*  And, you know, they're attacking the longshoremen for striking. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=821.28s)]
*  You know, people are saying, well, they're going to drive up inflation. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=825.28s)]
*  They're going to they're going to cause all the supply chain problems. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=828.28s)]
*  They are. But, you know, do you want these greedy corporations to keep making millions upon millions of dollars? [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=831.28s)]
*  But the biggest threat right now is artificial intelligence to the longshoremen. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=837.28s)]
*  If you look what they're doing in the ports in China, you know, everything is automated. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=841.28s)]
*  There's no jobs. These are these are semi automated. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=846.28s)]
*  Yes. These are legacy legacy industries that, you know, provide their hundred and thirty year industry would provide middle class jobs to people. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=848.28s)]
*  And, you know, they're getting attacked because people are getting a little inconvenienced. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=857.28s)]
*  Well, you know what? A little inconvenience. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=860.28s)]
*  Maybe maybe we'll give some support to these workers and, you know, hold the people accountable that caused this strike. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=861.28s)]
*  Everybody says, oh, the ILA striking. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=867.28s)]
*  No, the shipping lines that don't want to protect the jobs that don't want to reward these people that made them a success chose to strike themselves. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=869.28s)]
*  Right. Right. Right. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=877.28s)]
*  They could have made a yeah, everybody says they're the ones striking. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=879.28s)]
*  No, it's this other group that's not choosing to pay, not choosing to come to the table, not choosing to share like the like you said, not choosing to share with the people that have made made it happen. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=882.28s)]
*  You know, they're making billions upon billions of dollars. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=894.28s)]
*  You know, so I mean, it's like, you know, there's not not a whole lot of sympathy from us. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=896.28s)]
*  Yeah. As far as corporations and these shipping lines go. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=900.28s)]
*  And so is that a lot of what the ILA strike is over? [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=903.28s)]
*  It's obviously the fears of automation, you know, it's fears of automation is everywhere. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=906.28s)]
*  I mean, that's a huge, huge threat to the ILA. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=911.28s)]
*  But also, I mean, look, you know, everybody's saying, you know, there's people criticisms on online and all that long show and make one hundred forty thousand dollars a year. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=914.28s)]
*  That might be true. But when you start out, you start out twenty dollars per hour. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=922.28s)]
*  Right. And you look at twenty dollars an hour today with that catch you. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=926.28s)]
*  That's not. And then, you know, if they're making one hundred forty thousand, they're working seventy, eighty hours per week. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=930.28s)]
*  So, you know, there's not a whole lot of, you know, quality time at home with your family. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=936.28s)]
*  They have to work and one hundred forty thousand dollars is a great income. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=939.28s)]
*  But you put two kids, you get college, you've got a mortgage. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=943.28s)]
*  It doesn't go a long way. So, you know, it's time that, you know, we close that gap between, you know, the CEOs pay and in this case, the long showmen's pay. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=947.28s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, I think because what I don't understand is at what point is tech valued valuable to us as a society? [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=957.28s)]
*  It's like, do you want like I don't want to be a society that there's eleven people watching some robots do stuff. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=965.28s)]
*  That's what it feels like we're headed towards. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=972.28s)]
*  It feels like at a certain point you would stop some technology because it doesn't it kills your society. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=974.28s)]
*  It kills like the part of you that goes to work, the part of you that comes back that support your family, that gives inspiration to your kids because they see their parents working. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=980.28s)]
*  It's like it's almost crazy to me sometimes how we keep pushing our our society towards advancement. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=989.28s)]
*  If it's not, if we'll no longer be a society, then does that make any sense? [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=997.28s)]
*  Yeah, it's a society of convenience. That's the problem. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1002.28s)]
*  You know, and people don't realize the consequences of technology at some times, you know, I mean, look, to your point, you know, your product, your environment. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1005.28s)]
*  If you have a hard worker, mom and dad, they get up every day and go to do a middle class job. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1013.28s)]
*  That's that's what you want to do. That's what you want to aspire to do. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1017.28s)]
*  This technology, although, you know, we know technology is coming. We know technology is relevant. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1020.28s)]
*  Yeah, we got enough in certain certain arenas, but there's still there's still a lot of value to to the best computer in the world. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1028.28s)]
*  That's that's a human's brain and you know, your instinct and you know, there's got to be an opportunity, even if technology comes in to a certain extent, to create jobs as a result of technology. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1036.28s)]
*  Those eleven people you reference watching robots. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1047.28s)]
*  Well, at some point in time, the technology gets so good that those eleven people will be out of a job as well. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1050.28s)]
*  So it's like, come on, let's slow this thing down. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1055.28s)]
*  Let's figure out an opportunity to keep these jobs and give people an opportunity that may not have an opportunity to go to college that may not have the ability to be proficient in technology, but have a great work ethic and got a moral compass that wants to go in and give a hard day's work for a fair day's pay. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1057.28s)]
*  So, you know, that's the stuff we've got to look at. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1073.28s)]
*  And, you know, as a country, we're so short sighted on the damage of technology. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1075.28s)]
*  I mean, when you talk about autonomous vehicles, do you want a commercial vehicle, 80,000 pounds going down the street next to your family of four with no human driver present? [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1081.28s)]
*  Yes, some guys just yeah, an Indy or something. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1091.28s)]
*  He has a joystick, iPad or something. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1093.28s)]
*  Yeah, he has like a Xbox controller or something. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1096.28s)]
*  Yeah, and there's a catastrophic accident. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1098.28s)]
*  You know, and then you check the guy's browser, you know, you don't really know that. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1100.28s)]
*  Yeah, he got some other windows open. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1105.28s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1107.28s)]
*  He's got VR goggles on over there. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1109.28s)]
*  Looking at past P Diddy parties. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1111.28s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1113.28s)]
*  He's smoking out of his own nutsack over there. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1115.28s)]
*  A lot of perverts over there in India and all over the globe. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1118.28s)]
*  I'm not trying to single them out. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1121.28s)]
*  I'm perverted. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1123.28s)]
*  But, um, what was someone's gonna ask you about? [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1124.28s)]
*  Oh, so recently, recently we had Bernie Sanders on and he talked about a shorter workweek and about giving proceeds from automation to the workers because they're the ones who have gotten us to that point as well. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1127.28s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, look, there's a there's a there's a Bernie's the best. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1144.28s)]
*  I love Bernie's. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1148.28s)]
*  I think he's a little mad at me right now. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1149.28s)]
*  He's yelled at me in a couple of Senate hearings like flared up. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1151.28s)]
*  But, you know, he is truly committed to working class people. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1154.28s)]
*  There's no doubt about it. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1158.28s)]
*  You know, we're as a team for organization, you know, we negotiate contracts based on 40 hours per week. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1160.28s)]
*  But there are some industries that would like a 32 hour workweek paid 40 hours, which, you know, that's that's that's going to be that's going to be a tough fight moving forward. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1166.28s)]
*  You know, my thing is we got to protect preserve and improve what we already have right now. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1177.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1181.28s)]
*  Right. Because once you start giving away some, you never get it back. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1182.28s)]
*  Right. You never get it back. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1185.28s)]
*  Right here it says Senator Bernie Sanders, chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions announced that this Thursday he will introduce legislation to establish a standard 32 hour workweek. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1186.28s)]
*  Sanders said moving to a 32 hour workweek with no loss of pay is not a radical idea. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1198.28s)]
*  Today, American workers are over 400 percent more productive than they were in the 1940s. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1204.28s)]
*  And he means that the output is because also of automation, but automation is taking the people's jobs. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1208.28s)]
*  So then it's like it only makes fair sense to compensate the people who are whose jobs are being taken. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1215.28s)]
*  Right. Yeah. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1221.28s)]
*  And, you know, that's that's obviously a great justification for it. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1222.28s)]
*  But the reality of it is most of our members have to work 50 or 60 hours a week and have to have overtime. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1226.28s)]
*  So, you know, that's that's that's an issue that I think we'll be dealing with down the road. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1232.28s)]
*  But there is no doubt that we should be fighting to create jobs as a result of technology being implemented, not destroy them. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1235.28s)]
*  Yeah. Bernie's the best. I mean, he is hilarious. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1244.28s)]
*  He's very, very entertaining, man. He's very entertaining. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1246.28s)]
*  I know you had an issue with Mac Macau Malik was that Mark Wayne Mullen, Mark Wayne Mullen. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1249.28s)]

*  But and we'll give the money. We'll give the proceeds to you guys, too. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1265.28s)]
*  Yeah, we don't need that. I'll do that one for nothing. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1269.28s)]
*  All right. Halloween is right around the corner. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1271.28s)]

*  I mean, that's why we've been working so hard. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1522.28s)]
*  And if you see what we're doing all over the country with the UPS agreement and heiserbush record record agreements, negotiating strong contracts, we're trying to close that despair. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1524.28s)]

*  Let us do our thing. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1545.28s)]
*  And I always say to people, the neighborhood I grew up in, which had a lot of conflict in it, if there were two people fighting in the middle of the street, you had nothing to do with it. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1546.28s)]
*  Keep walking. It's going to end some point one way or the other. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1554.28s)]
*  Yeah. And that's that's the struggle. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1556.28s)]
*  But our whole focus on what we've been doing as a union and look, I'm a fourth generation team, so I love this fucking union. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1558.28s)]
*  It's given me everything in my entire life. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1564.28s)]
*  But the one thing that we need to do is advocate for for working people. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1567.28s)]
*  And you know what? People say, why should I join a union? [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1572.28s)]
*  Why should you join a union? [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1574.28s)]
*  Because we're going to get you better wages. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1575.28s)]

*  I want a piece of that for my men because when they made their most money was during COVID. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1847.28s)]
*  When my men had to go to work on those beers every single day, when everybody stayed home and went to work. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1853.28s)]
*  Not my men. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1860.28s)]
*  They died out there with the virus. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1861.28s)]
*  We all got sick with the virus. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1863.28s)]
*  We kept them going from Canada to Maine to Texas, Great Lakes, Puerto Rico, now to Bahamas. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1865.28s)]
*  Everybody went to work during COVID. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1872.28s)]
*  Nobody stayed home. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1874.28s)]
*  Well, I want to be compensated for that. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1876.28s)]
*  Amen. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1879.28s)]
*  I'm not asking for the world. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1880.28s)]
*  They know what I want. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1881.28s)]
*  They know what they want. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1882.28s)]
*  And if they don't, well, then I have to go into the street and we have to fight for what we rightfully deserve. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1884.28s)]
*  Fuck yeah. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1891.28s)]
*  These people today don't know what a strike is. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1892.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1894.28s)]
*  When my men hit the streets from Maine to Texas, every single port will lock down. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1895.28s)]
*  You know what's going to happen? [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1902.28s)]
*  That's good. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1903.28s)]
*  I'll tell you. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1904.28s)]
*  And so yeah, when they say, and when he says a lockdown, that would affect everything, right? [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1905.28s)]
*  Yeah, the ports are just shut down. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1910.28s)]
*  There's nothing coming in or out. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1911.28s)]
*  And we represent a lot of members that we haul off the ports. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1912.28s)]
*  The ports deliver to warehouses where it's separated, load on trucks. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1919.28s)]
*  We deliver it. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1923.28s)]
*  So it's going to have an impact. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1924.28s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1925.28s)]
*  It's a short-term pain for long-term gain for these guys. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1926.28s)]
*  And he's 100% accurate. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1931.28s)]
*  I mean, look, we get paid to fight. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1932.28s)]
*  We get paid to fight for our members. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1934.28s)]
*  And that's what he's doing. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1935.28s)]
*  Look, he's a character. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1937.28s)]
*  Have you spoken to him? [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1939.28s)]
*  So I haven't. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1940.28s)]
*  But I deal with the leadership around the country. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1941.28s)]
*  That's the only general president I haven't met that we deal with. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1945.28s)]
*  I know all the other general presidents around the country from all the other respective unions. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1949.28s)]
*  And I haven't met him. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1954.28s)]
*  I mean, the good news is he's so public right now. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1955.28s)]
*  It's keeping the shit away from me, to be honest with you. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1959.28s)]
*  Yeah, huh? [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1962.28s)]
*  I've been taking a lot of it lately, but I'm good either way. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1963.28s)]
*  I'm good. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1966.28s)]
*  I'm good. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1967.28s)]
*  But no, he's got the right fight. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1968.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1970.28s)]
*  It sounds like they got the right guy doing it. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1971.28s)]
*  Cast the characters. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1974.28s)]
*  He's straight out of the Sopranos. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1975.28s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1977.28s)]
*  I fucking hope they find some bodies in his yard. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1978.28s)]
*  Hopefully they don't. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1980.28s)]
*  Yeah, you're right. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1981.28s)]
*  And I shouldn't say that. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1982.28s)]
*  Sorry, Harold. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1983.28s)]
*  I don't know what he's into. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1984.28s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1985.28s)]
*  But yeah, that's what I'm saying is, dude, they got to... [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1986.28s)]
*  That's one of the things that starts to happen is it's like, if you don't think that automation, [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1989.28s)]
*  there's no effect to it, right? [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1995.28s)]
*  Then it's just... [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=1998.28s)]
*  There's a human cost to that. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2001.28s)]
*  There's a human cost to it. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2003.28s)]
*  Look when you're going to a grocery store now, right? [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2004.28s)]
*  Everybody's running to these self-checkouts. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2007.28s)]
*  I refuse to do it. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2009.28s)]
*  I don't. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2011.28s)]
*  And I was actually in a local grocery store probably about a year ago, and it was like [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2012.28s)]
*  late at night, and I forget why I was going in there. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2016.28s)]
*  I just got off a flight, and I got something real quick, and there was an older lady standing [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2021.28s)]
*  there at the register, and I go to go to her. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2026.28s)]
*  She was like, go over there. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2028.28s)]
*  Go to the automation. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2030.28s)]
*  Go over that one. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2031.28s)]
*  Self-checkout. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2032.28s)]
*  And she was working. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2033.28s)]
*  I go, listen, if I go into self-checkout, you're going to lose your job. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2034.28s)]
*  She's like, I don't give a shit. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2036.28s)]
*  I don't like this fucking job anyway. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2037.28s)]
*  So it was probably something she's doing. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2039.28s)]
*  I'm like, listen, lady, I know you might not like it, but let's think about the fucking [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2040.28s)]
*  30 other people that need a job that come in. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2043.28s)]
*  If I go there, then I'm putting you out of work. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2046.28s)]
*  I don't give a shit. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2048.2799999999997s)]
*  The problem is, it's like some people. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2049.28s)]
*  She's like, I'm on the only thing. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2051.28s)]
*  You're not on the only thing. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2053.28s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2055.28s)]
*  Elderly version. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2056.28s)]
*  What is it? [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2057.28s)]
*  The Golden Bachelorette? [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2058.28s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2059.28s)]
*  I haven't watched it, but I have a little. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2060.28s)]
*  I'll confess, I haven't either, and I probably won't. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2062.28s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2065.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2066.28s)]
*  But no, it's just people- [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2067.28s)]
*  That's a good point. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2069.28s)]
*  You don't think about it. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2070.28s)]
*  No, you don't. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2071.28s)]
*  And people, a disgruntled or that lady might have been having a bad night, whatever it was. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2072.28s)]
*  She might have been out of Zins, too, dude. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2077.28s)]
*  Yeah, she might have been, yeah. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2079.28s)]
*  Yeah, if you're working at late shift, dude, you got to put anything in your jaw to get [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2080.28s)]
*  you through the night. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2085.28s)]
*  But the problem is, she was in her late 70s, and it just goes to show you, hey, if you [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2086.28s)]
*  got in a union, you got a job, you got a pension, you wouldn't fucking be working at 70 years [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2091.28s)]
*  old. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2095.28s)]
*  That's a great point. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2096.28s)]
*  Yeah, and it's like, you're pointing out, you're pointing for me to go to a self-checkout, [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2097.28s)]
*  and I'm like, you're putting people out of work. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2102.28s)]
*  I don't give a shit. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2104.28s)]
*  Fuck that. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2105.28s)]
*  It's like, you know, she ran out of Paul Maul's, you know what I mean? [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2106.28s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2109.28s)]
*  Fuck that. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2110.28s)]
*  Go Raiders. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2111.28s)]
*  She starts fucking yelling, yeah. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2112.28s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2113.28s)]
*  Yeah, she probably spends all her money on fucking tattoos, you know? [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2114.28s)]
*  Yeah, like Marlboro's and fucking scratch tickets and shit, you know? [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2117.28s)]
*  Yeah, remember they used to have those miles you would get with the Marlboro's? [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2121.28s)]
*  Remember that? [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2123.28s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2124.28s)]
*  You'd smoke 400,000 packs of cigarettes to get a Camel Joe jacket. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2125.28s)]
*  That's something you got to wear to your funeral, yeah. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2129.28s)]
*  They put you in that thing. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2132.28s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2133.28s)]
*  You know, like a blender that said keep smoking on the side of the street. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2134.28s)]
*  I remember growing up in my neighborhood, Pepsi did this thing. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2137.28s)]
*  Remember that story that was on fucking Netflix? [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2139.28s)]
*  The kid won a space shuttle. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2141.28s)]
*  Yeah, the kid won a space shuttle. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2142.28s)]
*  Right, so I remember there was a kid in my neighborhood that, you know, he was so, [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2143.28s)]
*  his kid's name was Mike Lozaro, and he was like crazy. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2147.28s)]
*  Like, you know, you'd peel the cap off and you'd be a prize. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2151.28s)]

*  And that used to be a man. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2216.28s)]
*  That's how bad smoking can get, guys. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2217.28s)]
*  I think that was my English teacher in high school. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2219.28s)]
*  A-E-I-O-U. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2222.28s)]
*  Sometimes white. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2226.28s)]
*  Dude, I remember there's this kid, I used to tell this story, [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2228.28s)]
*  but there's this kid lived down the street from us. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2231.28s)]
*  This fella Mario was his name, and he was Italian, I think, or semi-Italian, you know? [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2233.28s)]
*  And he used to, my brother, something happened, my brother had to go away for the summer. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2240.28s)]
*  So suddenly I was his friend, but I was younger than my brother. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2246.28s)]
*  Did your brother go to jail? [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2249.28s)]
*  I don't know if he went to jail, but he went to a place where he couldn't come back for about four months. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2250.28s)]
*  And so I got, so suddenly I'm friends with Mario. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2254.28s)]
*  I would tag around with him, but I wasn't right there. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2259.28s)]
*  So now I'm friends with this dude, and he, I don't know if this is like a union thing or not, [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2263.28s)]
*  but he used to defecate in his yard and make me bury it, right? [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2267.28s)]
*  Make me put it in the ground for him. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2272.28s)]
*  So you contracted the work out. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2274.28s)]
*  That's what I wish I had known at the time, because yeah, I did over probably, [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2275.28s)]
*  I did at least 112 burials for this dude, right? [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2280.28s)]
*  Over about, over that stint, over that third of the year. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2284.28s)]
*  And then actually years later he died. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2288.28s)]
*  He drove a boat into an embankment, and I wanted to be a pallbearer at his funeral. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2292.28s)]
*  And I even wrote a letter to his mom, and I was like, I'd love to put him in the ground one more time, you know? [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2298.28s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2302.28s)]
*  And they wouldn't let me do it. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2303.28s)]
*  But if I was in a union. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2305.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2306.28s)]
*  I mean, it probably, you could probably go after him for retro pay and shit. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2307.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2311.28s)]
*  All the time. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2312.28s)]
*  You know? [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2313.28s)]
*  Oh, dude, definitely. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2314.28s)]
*  And the rose bushes in his yard? [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2315.28s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2317.28s)]
*  What are we even talking about? [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2318.28s)]
*  Prize winning, brother. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2319.28s)]
*  Oh, Jesus. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2320.28s)]
*  They won yard of the month fucking. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2321.28s)]
*  You definitely needed a union back then. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2322.28s)]
*  Bro, they won yard of the month in a leap year, dude. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2324.28s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2327.28s)]
*  And that's big work. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2328.28s)]
*  And that was me doing that. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2330.28s)]
*  And that was, listen, you contributed to that. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2331.28s)]
*  You should be proud. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2333.28s)]
*  But it is true. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2334.28s)]
*  It's gotten to the point where people don't even think about the people that are doing [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2335.28s)]
*  the jobs behind the scenes, you know? [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2340.28s)]
*  And people that are going in and clocking in day to day, you know? [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2342.28s)]
*  You look at like, so we represent UPS, which is, you know, a Fortune 500 company, 340,000 employees, [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2346.28s)]
*  very successful company, difficult company to deal with. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2353.28s)]
*  And, you know, 53 or 54% of those workers are part timers. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2356.28s)]
*  You know, they work four in the morning till eight or noon till four or whatever the case may be. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2362.28s)]
*  And they load and unload these trucks. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2367.28s)]
*  And prior to us, you know, completing successful negotiation, they were making $15 per hour nationwide. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2369.28s)]
*  Come on. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2375.28s)]
*  You had single mothers, you know, going to work there, you know, risking their lives during COVID. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2376.28s)]
*  They were the unsung heroes of keeping supply chain moving. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2381.28s)]
*  And, you know, it was a very, very credible argument that we had publicly. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2384.28s)]
*  But the company recognized it. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2389.28s)]
*  And during negotiations, I'm going to say, how embarrassing is it that you're making $100 billion with a B [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2391.28s)]
*  and you have people that are on subsidized housing, you have people that are on welfare that work for you? [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2399.28s)]
*  And I'll be honest with you, like, we push real hard and part timers start out at $21 an hour. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2404.28s)]
*  The long-term part timers are being rewarded. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2409.28s)]
*  They get full medical, full pensions. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2412.28s)]
*  So, you know, they recognize, you know, that they need to take care of these folks and a lot of pushing and prodding from us. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2414.28s)]
*  But at the end of the day, they did the right thing by these part timers. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2423.28s)]
*  And who are the major groups that are pushing back against you guys? [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2426.28s)]
*  Is it lobbies? Is it politicians? Is it just big business? [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2430.28s)]
*  It's, I'll tell you, it's a combination of corporate America. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2436.28s)]
*  And I refer to them all the time as fucking white collar criminals. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2440.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2443.28s)]
*  Right. That all they do is care about the bottom line, the balance sheet. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2444.28s)]
*  Money ****, I say, dude. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2447.28s)]
*  Right. Right. Right. And so, you know, they believe about ****. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2448.28s)]
*  Yeah. And then, so you know that nobody, yeah. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2452.28s)]
*  So then, yeah, I mean, fucking prostitutes. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2454.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2456.28s)]
*  And then you have, you know, these politicians, both sides, Democrats and Republicans. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2457.28s)]
*  I'll be honest with you, I'm a Democrat, but they have **** us over for the last 40 years and for once. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2463.28s)]
*  And not all of them, but for once, we're standing up as a union, probably the only one right now, [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2468.28s)]
*  saying, what the **** have you done for us? [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2474.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2476.28s)]
*  And I'm getting attacked from the left, you know, and we've given, since I've been in office two and a half years, [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2477.28s)]
*  we've given the Democratic machine $15.7 million. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2483.28s)]
*  We've given Republicans about $340,000, truth be told. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2488.28s)]
*  So it's like, you know, people say the Democratic Party is the party of the working people. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2492.28s)]
*  They're bought and paid for by big tech. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2496.28s)]
*  Those big tech companies. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2498.28s)]
*  Yeah, tech is the new fossil fuel, man. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2499.28s)]
*  That's what I say. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2501.28s)]
*  Right. And you've got the Republicans who are now saying, hey, we want to be the working class party, right? [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2502.28s)]
*  And okay, you've got a great opportunity right now to do that. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2507.28s)]
*  And the Democrats, if 60% of our members aren't supporting you, the **** system's broken. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2511.28s)]
*  They needed to fix it. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2517.28s)]
*  They need to fix it. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2518.28s)]
*  Stop pointing fingers at Sean O'Brien. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2519.28s)]
*  Stop pointing fingers at the Teamsters Union. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2520.28s)]
*  Look in the mirror. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2522.28s)]
*  I mean, I had a heated debate with, heated discussion two weeks ago with Chuck Schumer. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2523.28s)]
*  And it got **** ugly. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2528.28s)]
*  Chuck Schumer is a piece of ****. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2529.28s)]
*  And it got ugly because, you know, these politicians, you know, the one thing I've learned, [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2531.28s)]
*  they **** walk in and they tell you, I did this for you. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2536.28s)]
*  Okay, great. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2539.28s)]
*  Let me tell you what you haven't **** done for us or our members. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2540.28s)]
*  And we got into it pretty heavy. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2543.28s)]
*  And I'm like, you had no problem taking $550,000 from me three weeks prior to me going on the Republican National Convention. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2545.28s)]
*  And then you want to be a **** tough guy on Twitter or X or whatever it is and throw **** out there about me. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2552.28s)]
*  Like, whatever. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2558.28s)]
*  To support their, to support the parties, support the campaign. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2559.28s)]
*  The Teamsters Union has historically endorsed a candidate, right? [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2561.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2565.28s)]
*  A presidential candidate. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2566.28s)]
*  And this is one of the first times. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2567.28s)]
*  Two times we haven't. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2568.28s)]
*  1976 we didn't endorse. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2569.28s)]
*  In 1996 we didn't endorse. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2571.28s)]
*  Okay, so for the first time in 30 years now that you guys haven't done it. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2573.28s)]
*  And again, the reason why we didn't endorse in 1996, Clinton, because we endorsed him in 92. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2576.28s)]
*  And look, he created NAFTA and it **** a lot of our members over. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2581.28s)]
*  And we lost jobs as a result of it. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2585.28s)]
*  So we couldn't, we couldn't endorse him. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2587.28s)]
*  What an asshole. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2589.28s)]
*  Why would he do it though? [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2590.28s)]
*  Why? [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2591.28s)]
*  Because who were they beholden to? [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2592.28s)]
*  Even though they say, we're beholden to working people, we're beholden to middle class, we're beholden to American worker. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2594.28s)]
*  They're beholden to, look, all this money and the next opportunity, right? [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2600.28s)]
*  Because you're not there a long time, right? [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2605.28s)]
*  And, you know, the next opportunity, it's like, what's his name? [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2607.28s)]
*  The guy that looks like **** Bradley Cooper, the governor of California, Newsom. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2611.28s)]
*  That guy is bought and paid for by Big Tech. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2617.28s)]
*  You know, he had the opportunity to protect the general public and his constituents from AI, from autonomous vehicles, [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2621.28s)]
*  from all this **** that we talked about earlier. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2631.28s)]
*  And we, the union, union men and women, actually got him to stay in office as a result of that recall. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2633.28s)]
*  We went out and worked hard for him. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2641.28s)]
*  And what's he do? [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2643.28s)]
*  He **** vetoes all these protections against artificial intelligence, against Uber, against Lyft, all this ****. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2644.28s)]
*  And these are the people that we were supporting. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2652.28s)]
*  Like, are you ****ing me? Seriously. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2655.28s)]
*  So they're turning their back on you. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2657.28s)]
*  They're turning their back on us. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2658.28s)]
*  So listen, I can't speak for any other unions, but I'm going to speak for the Teamsters Union. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2659.28s)]
*  I represent 1.3 million members. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2663.28s)]
*  And, you know, we've said all along, we took over, like, we want a return on our investment. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2665.28s)]
*  We want to be like big business. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2669.28s)]
*  We make an investment, we want a return. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2671.28s)]
*  And that return with these politicians are supporting our issues. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2673.28s)]
*  That's going to protect jobs and promote unionization throughout the whole country. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2676.28s)]
*  And, you know, they've let us down. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2679.28s)]
*  They've let us down. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2681.28s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2682.28s)]
*  I'm a person, I think, probably to my own fault. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2683.28s)]
*  My mother keeps saying, you keep fighting with all these ****ing politicians, you're going to get us all audited. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2686.28s)]
*  Well, that's OK, right? [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2690.28s)]
*  Audited? I thought I'd kill, but that's how they do it first. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2691.28s)]
*  They better get up early, you know? [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2694.28s)]
*  Can't kill the willing, you know what I mean? [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2695.28s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2697.28s)]
*  Well, I'll take my own life. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2698.28s)]
*  Now what? [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2699.28s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2700.28s)]
*  I showed you. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2701.28s)]
*  I'll be on the clock. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2702.28s)]
*  Yeah, I'll still be on the clock. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2703.28s)]
*  You bet, dude. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2705.28s)]
*  You don't think I'm clocking out for it, dude. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2706.28s)]
*  I'll be on double time. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2708.28s)]
*  We're letting that thing run, brother. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2710.28s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2712.28s)]
*  Yeah, but I mean, it's just people got to step up. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2713.28s)]
*  California Governor Gavin Newsom vetoed a Teamsters-backed bill that would have effectively banned autonomous trucks in the state. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2715.28s)]
*  Wow. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2720.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2721.28s)]
*  And you know how many people there are in California? [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2722.28s)]
*  But what does it say? [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2724.28s)]
*  2286 would have prohibited the operation of autonomous vehicles weighing 10,000 pounds or more on public roads for testing, transporting goods or carrying passengers without a human safety operator physically present in the vehicle. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2725.28s)]
*  There should be somebody in the vehicle anyway. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2738.28s)]
*  There's no hope. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2740.28s)]
*  Because that thing's also going to get hijacked, dude. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2741.28s)]
*  You think MS-13 isn't going to want a bunch of carrots or whatever is passing through? [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2743.28s)]
*  They're going to fucking shoot, dude. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2748.28s)]
*  They sent one of those little gypsy cruises with the... [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2751.28s)]
*  It's like a Datsun B210 loaded up. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2754.28s)]
*  It was a little R2D2, but it was kind of aftermarket slightly, you know? [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2757.28s)]
*  And they had one of those rolling through the hood one time with some ice creams in it or something you could buy out of it, and 11 brothers beat the shit out of that thing. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2763.28s)]
*  So what are they even talking about, dude? [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2772.28s)]
*  This shit will get hijacked so quick. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2775.28s)]
*  But then you're going to have to put a gunner on the top of the... [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2777.28s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2780.28s)]
*  It's just getting weird. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2781.28s)]
*  Bring that back up, please, Trevin. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2782.28s)]
*  Thank you, bud. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2783.28s)]
*  It's important to note that 35 jurisdictions, including Arizona, Nevada, Texas, Washington, and the District of Columbia, have already authorized the testing of heavy-duty autonomous vehicles. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2785.28s)]
*  Wow. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2794.28s)]
*  That's what Newsom said. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2795.28s)]
*  California remains the only state to actively prohibit these vehicles. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2797.28s)]
*  But it's also a huge state where there's so much agriculture and stuff. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2800.28s)]
*  And there's a huge port over there as well, right? [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2804.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2806.28s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2807.28s)]
*  LA Port, Long Beach. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2808.28s)]
*  You've got some big ports over there. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2809.28s)]
*  So they're not on strike. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2810.28s)]
*  They're under a different union. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2812.28s)]
*  They're the ILWU. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2813.28s)]
*  But, you know, same issues. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2814.28s)]
*  I'm sure they'll be fighting the same battle down the road. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2816.28s)]
*  But, yeah, this is the stuff that we're fighting against. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2818.28s)]
*  And look, these politicians, you know, they've got to realize that their constituents don't work for them. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2822.28s)]
*  They work for their constituents. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2828.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2830.28s)]
*  That's what they have to be reminded of. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2831.28s)]
*  And there's a lot of good ones that do a lot of great work. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2832.28s)]
*  Like, you know, we've got a great relationship. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2834.28s)]
*  And our goal is to try and work bipartisan. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2836.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2839.28s)]
*  Because that's the only way we're going to get shit done, right? [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2840.28s)]
*  And, you know, there's been a line drawn in the sand. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2841.28s)]
*  And our focus has been as a union and mine as a leader is like, look, we can fucking agree to disagree on a lot of shit. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2844.28s)]
*  We're going to. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2851.28s)]
*  But let's agree on the stuff that we can and get some stuff done in this country. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2852.28s)]
*  You know, get some real, real progressive legislation that we can work together on. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2855.28s)]
*  But, you know, the focus has been lost and the whole system is a fucking disgrace, to be honest with you. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2860.28s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2865.28s)]
*  And it's time to shake these pedophiles down, dude. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2866.28s)]
*  That's how I feel. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2868.28s)]
*  What else does it say on here? [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2869.28s)]
*  The team's reunion issued a statement criticizing Newsom's veto. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2871.28s)]
*  The vast majority of Californians oppose unregulated, unaccountable driverless cars and trucks on the road. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2874.28s)]
*  Do yes, there's already so many. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2880.28s)]
*  Yeah, it's like because then if somebody hits you, what do you just. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2882.28s)]
*  You can't even sue anybody. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2887.28s)]
*  You're just what you're like that guy hit me and the cops like who you're like, I fucking know. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2889.28s)]
*  Why do they need cops? [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2893.28s)]
*  What do you need cops for? [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2894.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2895.28s)]
*  You can't write anybody up. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2896.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2897.28s)]
*  I mean, I mean, that's another thing. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2898.28s)]
*  Public safety. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2899.28s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2900.28s)]
*  And it's it's going to get bad. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2901.28s)]
*  Yeah, it's going to get ugly. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2902.28s)]
*  And we're going to be a world of robots. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2903.28s)]
*  If people like us don't step up and hold. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2904.28s)]
*  I mean, politicians accountable. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2907.28s)]
*  Look, I'll eat beans, man. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2908.28s)]
*  I'll do what I got to do for as long as it takes, brother. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2910.28s)]
*  If there's no. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2912.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2913.28s)]
*  As long as I got, I guess, candles, I guess. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2914.28s)]
*  What else do I? [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2917.28s)]
*  Yeah, we'd have to have candles, water, dude wipes, dude wipes for sure. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2918.28s)]
*  You know, unless you're not eating, you know, unless it gets that bad, you're not wiping. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2922.28s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2926.28s)]
*  Save money on both ends. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2927.28s)]
*  But yeah, yeah, I'm going to have to get some stuff. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2929.28s)]
*  Oh, God. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2932.28s)]
*  That's why we get these shirts made up, you know? [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2933.28s)]
*  Yeah, I'd love to get one of those. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2935.28s)]
*  You're going to have one by the time I leave here today. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2937.28s)]
*  Amen. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2939.28s)]
*  Do you see that? [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2940.28s)]
*  We deliver results, not excuses. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2941.28s)]
*  Yeah, they deliver results, not excuses. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2943.28s)]
*  Take me through some of the decision and what it was like behind the scenes to make the [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2945.28s)]
*  choice not to endorse a candidate. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2950.28s)]
*  Well, look, the one thing that we pride ourselves on when we took over as leaders was transparency [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2952.28s)]
*  and inclusiveness, right? [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2956.28s)]
*  So when you have 1.3 million members, it's important to make certain you understand their [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2958.28s)]
*  perspective because that's who our employers, that's who we work for. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2964.28s)]
*  That's who gives me the opportunity and privilege to represent them. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2967.28s)]
*  And we went through for the first time ever, we brought every single one of our employees [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2970.28s)]
*  and we brought every single candidate in from the beginning. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2974.28s)]
*  And we invited every one of them from Dr. Cornel West all the way, former President Donald Trump, [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2977.28s)]
*  former President Biden, and then VP Harris and everybody in between, RFK who I love that guy. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2985.28s)]
*  I love that guy, too. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2991.28s)]
*  That guy is awesome, man. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2992.28s)]
*  He is the best. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2993.28s)]
*  And we brought them all in in a roundtable, first time ever, with rank and file members, [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2994.28s)]
*  8 to 10 of them from various parts of the country, various political affiliations. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=2999.28s)]
*  And we asked them specific questions that were important to us. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3004.28s)]
*  And at the end of the day, we did the meetings there, then we did polling, straw polling [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3008.28s)]
*  in the union halls, and then we did electronic polling, 1.3 million of our members, QR code, [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3016.28s)]
*  where we had over 40,000 members participate, which is huge. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3023.28s)]
*  And then we did scientific-based polling using the Democratic pollster that the Biden-Harris campaign used. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3026.28s)]
*  And the only poll that was favorable was the poll we did, the straw poll in the union halls, [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3033.28s)]
*  which was polling 44% Biden and 38% Trump. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3039.28s)]
*  So the other polls were 60, 62% Republican. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3046.28s)]
*  In favor of Trump? [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3050.28s)]
*  In favor of Trump, yes. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3052.28s)]
*  We sent the electronic polling after President Biden dropped out of the race. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3054.28s)]
*  Look, Biden's been great for unions, working people, but the reality of it is he's gone. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3061.28s)]
*  He's deceased. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3069.28s)]
*  He's gone. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3070.28s)]
*  And again, it's like we've got to take into consideration our members' opinions. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3071.28s)]
*  And I don't have the beauty of leaning one way or the other. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3078.28s)]
*  I have to represent both Democratic members and also Republican members. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3081.28s)]
*  And quite frankly, when I spoke at the RNC, that's when the attacks started happening [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3085.28s)]
*  from the Democratic left and the Republican right. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3091.28s)]
*  Wait, so just to back up to something, and so a straw poll means... [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3095.28s)]
*  It means you go to the union halls. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3098.28s)]
*  We have 319 union halls nationwide. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3100.28s)]
*  So you actually have an in-person meeting town hall where you get to actually, you know, [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3103.28s)]
*  control the meeting, right? [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3110.28s)]
*  You control the narrative, but our members get to vote in a secret ballot. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3112.28s)]
*  And when you have meetings like that straw poll, usually you can put your thumb on the scale [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3116.28s)]
*  and flip it either way. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3122.28s)]
*  We thought we were going to come out of there with Joe Biden at 80% and the rest, [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3123.28s)]
*  because there are people coming in there, for the most part, that show up. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3127.28s)]
*  There are people that work on your staff, and when it only pulls 44%, something's wrong. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3130.28s)]
*  Something's broken. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3136.28s)]
*  So that's why we started doing extensive polling, which is usually... [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3137.28s)]
*  Because most of the unions are extremely Democratic. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3140.28s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3142.28s)]
*  That's what you're saying. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3143.28s)]
*  Okay, I see what you're saying now. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3144.28s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3145.28s)]
*  The team for this polling data shows members backed Biden 44% to Trump's 36.3%. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3146.28s)]
*  So that's more lopsided than usual. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3152.28s)]
*  Well, we were thinking that it was going to be 80% Biden, because, you know, [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3154.28s)]
*  the people that show up at union halls for union meetings and any type of meetings [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3160.28s)]
*  are usually your supporters. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3165.28s)]
*  They're usually the people that are going to vote or follow your recommendations [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3166.28s)]
*  or whatever it is. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3170.28s)]
*  Oh, yeah, their children dress up like plumbers and stuff for Halloween and everything. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3171.28s)]
*  Well, we do check their membership cards, you know? [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3176.28s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, well... [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3178.28s)]
*  And some of them get in when they're 11-teen. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3179.28s)]
*  I'm only kidding. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3181.28s)]
*  I'm only kidding. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3183.28s)]
*  Okay, so at that point you realize, okay, so things are a little bit more... [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3184.28s)]
*  There's people at different... [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3188.28s)]
*  There's a divide. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3191.28s)]
*  There's a divide. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3192.28s)]
*  There's a huge divide. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3193.28s)]
*  So then at that point, did you make the decision to not support a candidate or support a... [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3194.28s)]
*  No, we took all the data. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3199.28s)]
*  And, you know, historically the team says unions never, ever endorsed a presidential [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3200.28s)]
*  candidate until after both respective conventions are concluded. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3205.28s)]
*  Okay. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3208.28s)]
*  So we asked to speak at the Republican and Democratic. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3209.28s)]
*  Obviously, we spoke at the Republican, and then we didn't get invited to the Democratic [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3213.28s)]
*  National Convention. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3218.28s)]
*  Did they get back to you? [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3219.28s)]
*  Did you see... [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3220.28s)]
*  Yeah, they never got back to us. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3221.28s)]
*  They never got back to us. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3222.28s)]
*  They never got back to us. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3223.28s)]
*  And you email them or text them? [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3224.28s)]
*  Oh, we called them. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3226.28s)]
*  We sent the invitation. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3227.28s)]
*  We sent the request to speak at both conventions at the same time. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3229.28s)]
*  And we heard from the Republican National Convention right away. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3233.28s)]
*  Now, look, going in there was like... [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3237.28s)]
*  It wasn't easy. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3240.28s)]
*  It was like, you know, going into an ex-girlfriend's house who family hates you because of a bad [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3241.28s)]
*  breakup on Thanksgiving and saying, how are you all doing? [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3246.28s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3249.28s)]
*  It wasn't a comfortable feeling. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3250.28s)]
*  And, you know, but like I said, everybody else, when we get the opportunity to highlight [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3252.28s)]
*  American workers and or teams as you have to do it, we're going to do it any and all [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3258.28s)]
*  platforms there are, whether we're welcome or not. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3262.28s)]
*  And we wanted to do the same at the Democratic National Convention. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3264.28s)]
*  We didn't get that opportunity. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3268.28s)]
*  But, you know, so to get back to your point was after we did all the scientific polling, [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3269.28s)]
*  after we... [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3274.28s)]
*  After the conventions, you know, we have a general executive board, which are 24 leaders [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3275.28s)]
*  from all around the country, vice presidents and presidents... [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3280.28s)]
*  Teams are leaders? [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3283.28s)]
*  Yes, they make up the general executive board. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3284.28s)]
*  So we presented all the polling data. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3286.28s)]
*  We had, you know, spirited debate and dialogue, very respectful. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3289.28s)]
*  And at the end of the day, you know, there were three people that voted to endorse the [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3294.28s)]
*  Harris-Waltz campaign and the majority of the rest of the executive board voted to [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3300.28s)]
*  not endorse and allow local unions and area joint councils to go out and, you know, [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3306.28s)]
*  endorse whoever they wanted. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3313.28s)]
*  And, you know, again, you get criticized no matter what you do. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3314.28s)]
*  So... [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3318.28s)]
*  But it was the right decision because, you know, both candidates, Harris and former [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3319.28s)]
*  President Trump, you know, didn't answer specific questions of what was important to us. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3325.28s)]
*  So, you know... [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3331.28s)]
*  Like, for example, so which ones... [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3333.28s)]
*  So it's like our right to strike. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3334.28s)]
*  Like right now, you see the ILA on strike. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3336.28s)]
*  We had the railroad workers when we first took over two years ago. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3338.28s)]
*  They're under what they call Railway Labor Act, where Congress can make a recommendation [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3343.28s)]
*  to implement the contract under the process. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3348.28s)]
*  And they did it. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3350.28s)]
*  And our members weren't happy. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3352.28s)]
*  They did it under the Biden administration. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3353.28s)]
*  And one of our biggest goals moving forward because we've got this campaign with United Airlines [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3355.28s)]
*  where they're under the same process. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3359.28s)]
*  We want the right to strike. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3361.28s)]
*  And we can get the right to strike once we conclude the process. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3363.28s)]
*  But a lot of times the government will intervene and they'll, you know, obviously implement a contract. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3366.28s)]
*  So that was very important to us. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3371.28s)]
*  Look, if we're in the middle of an RLA negotiation and we want the right to strike, [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3373.28s)]
*  are you going to support us? [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3378.28s)]
*  Are you going to stop us? [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3379.28s)]
*  Wasn't a commitment from both sides on that. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3380.28s)]
*  On either side, Republican or Democrat. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3383.28s)]
*  On either side on that. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3385.28s)]
*  Not even supporting your right to strike. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3386.28s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3387.28s)]
*  That's, you know, that's in certain arenas under the Railway Labor Act. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3388.28s)]
*  Like airlines are under the Railway Labor Act. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3390.28s)]
*  Railroads are on the Railway Labor Act. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3392.28s)]
*  Trucking industry isn't. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3394.28s)]
*  Most private sector that we represent isn't. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3395.28s)]
*  So, you know, we still have the right to strike in other arenas. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3398.28s)]
*  But these are important industries for us. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3401.28s)]
*  So we didn't get commitments on that. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3404.28s)]
*  You know, one candidate may have been stronger on a pro act. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3405.28s)]
*  You know, obviously supporting the right to organize, supporting collective bargaining agreements. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3408.28s)]
*  We didn't get a strong commitment from the Republican side on vetoing national right to work. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3413.28s)]
*  So, and again, when you're face to face with people and you're asking questions, [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3419.28s)]
*  and look, we give the questions to all the candidates prior. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3424.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3429.28s)]
*  So it's like, fucking prepare. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3430.28s)]
*  Lie to us. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3432.28s)]
*  Tell us what we want to hear. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3433.28s)]
*  Right? [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3435.28s)]
*  And when they can't answer the question, or they try and go around you, look, we're pretty sophisticated now. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3436.28s)]
*  We're not as dumb as we look. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3441.28s)]
*  And our members are certainly not dumb. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3442.28s)]
*  Yeah, some of them are on break or whatever. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3445.28s)]
*  Yeah, some of them might be on break. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3447.28s)]
*  Hey, look, that's fine, brother. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3449.28s)]
*  Third coffee break of the day. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3451.28s)]
*  But they earned it. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3452.28s)]
*  Thank God for the unions. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3453.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3454.28s)]
*  You know, but, you know, they didn't answer the questions. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3455.28s)]
*  So it's like, put the polling numbers together, put the in-person interviews. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3458.28s)]
*  You know, we did the right thing. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3464.28s)]
*  We did the right thing, but I remember it's no matter what. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3466.28s)]
*  And I'll defend that all day long. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3468.28s)]
*  But, you know, the problem is it's like the good news about this whole situation is you see how treacherous the far left can be and the far right. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3470.28s)]
*  And I think it's fucking hilarious because, you know, don't threaten us with a good time. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3479.28s)]
*  You want to fight? [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3484.28s)]
*  Let's do it. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3485.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3486.28s)]
*  You know, and, you know, we'll cut their money off. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3487.28s)]
*  We'll do whatever, whatever it takes. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3488.28s)]
*  They're going to have to earn it moving forward. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3490.28s)]
*  They've done a lot of personal attacks. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3491.28s)]
*  They've done a lot of attacks on our members. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3492.28s)]
*  And, you know, we're ready to go. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3495.28s)]
*  Whoever wins, either way, you know. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3498.28s)]
*  They're going to have to deal with you. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3500.28s)]
*  They're going to have to deal with us. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3502.28s)]
*  We control commerce in this country. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3503.28s)]
*  Fuck yeah, dude. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3504.28s)]
*  And we're powerful and we're not afraid to fight. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3505.28s)]
*  We'd rather just fight corporate America instead of dealing with this other bullshit, which is distraction. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3507.28s)]
*  You know, we've had politicians, right, that, oh, we support you. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3513.28s)]
*  We support you. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3517.28s)]
*  We support you. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3518.28s)]
*  When we're doing the UPS negotiations, you know, there were some high profile people that, you know, [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3519.28s)]
*  and senators that, you know, claim to be the working people, the Schumers of the world and some others. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3524.28s)]
*  We're pro-union. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3528.28s)]
*  We want to support unions. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3529.28s)]
*  They wouldn't sign off on a support letter for UPS workers prior to going into these negotiations. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3530.28s)]
*  They wouldn't sign off of support letters, you know, while we're striking these DSPs where your mom works at Amazon. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3536.28s)]
*  So it's like, what does that tell you? [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3542.28s)]
*  It means, you know, they're afraid they're going to get their campaign contribution taken away from Amazon and Big Tech. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3544.28s)]
*  Well, don't say one thing and do another. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3549.28s)]
*  Be consistent. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3551.28s)]
*  If you want to be in bed with Big Tech, just tell us. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3552.28s)]
*  Be transparent. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3555.28s)]
*  Like, you'll always hear me say, the one thing I do, and this is me, probably to a fault, I always state my fucking intentions clearly. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3556.28s)]
*  I'm going to come after you. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3564.28s)]
*  We're going to get X, Y and Z for our members. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3565.28s)]
*  And if you don't, you're choosing to strike yourself. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3567.28s)]
*  So accept the consequences. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3570.28s)]
*  If you're going to screw us over, don't fucking hide behind false promises. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3571.28s)]
*  Screw us over. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3575.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3576.28s)]
*  You know, tell us you're going to screw us. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3577.28s)]
*  I'm happy. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3578.28s)]
*  We'll figure out how we deal with it. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3579.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3580.28s)]
*  Fuck me in the face. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3581.28s)]
*  Don't fuck me in the rear or whatever. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3582.28s)]
*  How some people do it. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3583.28s)]
*  I don't do it like that. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3584.28s)]
*  No, no. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3585.28s)]
*  No baby oil here. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3586.28s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3588.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3591.28s)]
*  If only did he would have unionized, man. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3592.28s)]
*  He would have definitely violated every human resource policy and procedure. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3595.28s)]
*  He probably wouldn't lasted too long. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3599.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3601.28s)]
*  And one of the, yeah, the first one, wash your hands. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3602.28s)]
*  That's the number one. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3604.28s)]
*  I mean, that's above every sink, you know. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3605.28s)]
*  Or age appropriate. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3608.28s)]
*  Amen, dude. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3610.28s)]
*  You know, I got my producers some tickets to the Tennessee Titans versus Green Bay Packers game a few weeks ago. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3612.28s)]
*  And I did it on game time. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3619.28s)]
*  Game time has a new feature called game time picks that makes getting tickets for concerts [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3622.28s)]
*  and events easier. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3628.28s)]
*  Game time picks filters out the fluff to show you only incredible deals on great seats. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3631.28s)]
*  So you don't have to waste time searching through thousands of tickets. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3638.28s)]
*  Additionally, game time has the lowest price guarantee or game time will credit you 110 percent of the difference. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3642.28s)]
*  Take the guesswork out of buying concert tickets and any tickets with game time. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3652.28s)]
*  Download the game time app, create an account and use code weekend for $20 off your first purchase. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3659.28s)]

*  What time is it? [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3680.28s)]
*  Game time. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3682.28s)]
*  This episode is brought to you by BetterHelp. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3683.28s)]
*  You know, we all wear masks sometimes. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3686.28s)]
*  Ways that we present ourselves to the world and just things that we allow people to see. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3689.28s)]
*  But behind that, sometimes there's a whole orchestra of stuff going on. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3695.28s)]
*  Thoughts and feelings and uncertainties. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3701.28s)]
*  And a lot of times that can get overwhelming. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3704.28s)]
*  When I get in those instances, I reach out for help. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3707.28s)]
*  Therapy I'm talking about. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3711.28s)]
*  BetterHelp is exactly who I'm speaking of. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3713.28s)]
*  If you're thinking of starting therapy, give BetterHelp a try. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3717.28s)]
*  It's entirely online. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3721.28s)]
*  It's designed to be convenient, flexible and suited to your schedule. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3723.28s)]
*  Just fill out a brief questionnaire to get matched with a licensed therapist. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3728.28s)]
*  And you can switch therapists at any time for no additional charge. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3733.28s)]

*  When you strike for recognition, it sends a strong message to the employer that, you know, our members are united. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3968.28s)]
*  Our members are strong and they want to fight for a contract. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3974.28s)]

*  I mean, there's a lot to be said about disruption. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3980.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3983.28s)]

*  You got to stand up. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3991.28s)]
*  And it's a great litmus test for us because we know how strong the group is or isn't. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3992.28s)]
*  And these Amazon workers, I got to tell you, they have courage and conviction like I've never seen. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=3996.28s)]
*  And, you know, two, two and a half years ago, you know, we put this as a priority. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4002.28s)]
*  We've got to organize Amazon workers. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4006.28s)]
*  And we have been working, you know, tirelessly around the country. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4008.28s)]
*  And this is going to be a reality. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4012.28s)]
*  This is definitely going to be a reality. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4013.28s)]
*  You know why? [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4015.28s)]
*  Because once you shut, you know, companies like Amazon down or you shut a DHL down or any company, you shut the ports down, [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4016.28s)]
*  it sends a strong fucking message on, look, this is, this is important. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4023.28s)]
*  And these corporations need to realize who's actually in charge. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4027.28s)]
*  It's not them. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4030.28s)]

*  and different Verizon, whatever. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4041.28s)]
*  I don't care if my cell phone doesn't work, dude. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4044.28s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? I don't want a cell phone anymore. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4046.28s)]
*  Yeah, I know. It ruins everything. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4048.28s)]
*  It's awful. It's awful. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4049.28s)]
*  It's like we've ruined kind of it's like we've let technology take away so many things that were valuable to us. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4051.28s)]
*  And then you see the effects of it on children and they don't know the difference. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4057.28s)]
*  Right. But then you see some some countries like Poland who are standing up for like whatever their beliefs are as a country [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4061.28s)]
*  and like their moral fortitude. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4068.28s)]
*  And and it's interesting that it's interesting. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4070.28s)]
*  Sometimes I wish that we did more stuff like that. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4073.28s)]
*  You know, we started to realize like, hey, just because this is a technological advancement or because it makes things easier. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4075.28s)]
*  Is it good for us? [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4082.28s)]

*  You know, we talk about phones. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4088.28s)]
*  I used to be able to memorize 10 or 15 phone numbers. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4090.28s)]
*  Right. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4094.28s)]
*  Because I'd go to a pay phone and I'd call someone and I didn't have the number written down. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4095.28s)]

*  Home run. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4120.280000000001s)]
*  The best part about pay phones was when you were on one and some guy like a homeless guy or whatever, like we're trying to get someone trying to rob you can just hit him with the receiver. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4121.28s)]
*  Yeah, but it was never long enough. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4129.28s)]
*  It would get so it would get an inch from their skull. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4132.28s)]
*  And you'd be like, oh, shit, now he's going to hit me. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4135.28s)]
*  Yeah. You have to put in 40 more cents and you'll get like three extra inches of cord, you know, and you could beat the guy, you know, crank calls with the best from pay phones. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4138.28s)]
*  Pay phones were the best also because, well, first of all, you used to be able to hide from people. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4146.28s)]
*  You could be like, I can't be that nobody could know where you were. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4152.28s)]
*  They couldn't get in touch with you at all times. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4155.28s)]
*  Do you share your location? [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4158.28s)]
*  You'd have to. Oh, no, I don't share my location, dude. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4159.28s)]
*  I don't either. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4161.28s)]
*  Yeah. I'm not sharing my location, dude. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4162.28s)]
*  I would. That's crazy with I don't even know who would. Yeah, but yeah, that's crazy. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4166.28s)]
*  You're not going to see me coming. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4171.28s)]
*  Motherfucker. Imagine your parents tracking you like 25 years ago on social media. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4173.28s)]
*  Now, I would have tied my phone to a cat's back or whatever. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4178.28s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let that bitch hit the streets. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4181.28s)]
*  Dr. Tapetite, the German shop, it's called. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4183.28s)]
*  It's going to run around. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4185.28s)]
*  Oh, be awful. They track. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4187.28s)]
*  I'm 53 years old and we ran wild like back in the day. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4189.28s)]
*  Oh, yeah. And I couldn't imagine my poor my mother. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4194.28s)]
*  We ran her hard. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4197.28s)]
*  You know, we ran her hard, but I can't imagine like these fucking idiots put everything on social media now. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4198.28s)]
*  And it's like, really? [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4203.28s)]
*  Like we used to be able to lie themselves out. Oh, yeah. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4205.28s)]
*  People read that they tell their boss, they can't come in and work and then they're partying or something. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4208.28s)]
*  They're Buffalo Wild Wings or whatever. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4212.28s)]
*  Dude, yeah, we used to used to be able to lie to somebody and they didn't know you were lying. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4215.28s)]
*  What about that beautiful piece of America that we lost? [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4220.28s)]
*  The ability to lie and not get caught. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4223.28s)]
*  You could tell a woman you were a lawyer or whatever. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4225.28s)]
*  And she's like, you're 11. And I'm like, who cares? [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4228.28s)]
*  The defense rests, you know. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4231.28s)]
*  But those were the days, man. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4233.28s)]
*  You could go into another city and, yeah, you could just make up stuff. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4235.28s)]
*  You didn't have to be a criminal forever if you were online or something. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4240.28s)]
*  So much of the fun is gone because a lot of the mystery is gone. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4243.28s)]
*  But the last thing we can, if we lose the like, man, it's just so crazy because so much of the fabric of our society has started to dissolve. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4248.28s)]
*  It's like, you know, it's not as much of a Christian nation anymore. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4256.28s)]
*  It's not, we haven't stood up for even, and even if it's, if it doesn't have to be a religious nation, it should be a moral nation, right? [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4260.28s)]
*  And we don't protect, like, we don't stand for things morally, like business is just taken over. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4267.28s)]
*  It's, yeah, like greed. It's just, it's gotten crazy. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4273.28s)]
*  How about people? How about people? [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4276.28s)]
*  You know, everybody talks about, you know, all this righteous bullshit, right? [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4278.28s)]
*  And a lot of it's, some of it's good, some of it's bad. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4283.28s)]
*  But, you know, recently I work in Washington, D.C. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4286.28s)]
*  And there were people actively desecrating monuments and lighting the American flag on fire. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4290.28s)]
*  Now, regardless of what your position is on anything going on in the world, like, growing up, [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4297.28s)]
*  one value that we add is you respect that flag and you defend it with everything you got. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4302.28s)]
*  And I kind of, I posted a picture of an American flag on social media. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4307.28s)]
*  And I'm not really allowed to touch my social media, you know, because like guys like Will and Brian, [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4312.28s)]
*  my good people that are around me, Chief of Staff, they protect me from myself because there's certain things that just drives me nuts. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4318.28s)]
*  But I post the American flag and I wrote, I will defend and honor this till the day I die and everybody else should. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4325.28s)]
*  We're in the greatest country in the world. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4332.28s)]
*  I got a tack like on these private DMs saying, well, Supreme Court said it's legal to burn a flag. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4334.28s)]
*  Okay, so it's legal to burn a flag because the Supreme Court says is it morally right to desecrate something so sacred? [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4341.28s)]
*  So that's where like I think we got to get back to basics and say, look, let's fucking cut this bullshit. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4349.28s)]
*  We're in the greatest place in the world. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4354.28s)]
*  But we don't even. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4356.28s)]
*  But now it's almost if you say America, you say USA, you're suddenly a right. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4357.28s)]
*  You're far right. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4362.28s)]
*  You know, it's like if you put an American like some people think the American flag, it's like it's been positioned by the media that it's not even that it's not our unifying flag anymore. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4363.28s)]
*  You know, that it's for one party. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4375.28s)]
*  And they did that on purpose. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4377.28s)]
*  And it's it's unbelievable. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4379.28s)]
*  It's sick. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4380.28s)]
*  And we took the Pledge of Allegiance out of schools, little things that I think have an effect on on yourself and your psyche in a positive way to make you feel like you're part of a group. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4382.28s)]
*  And when you don't feel like you're part of a group anymore, you don't feel like you're part of the fabric of America, that it's not a real thing. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4390.28s)]
*  Then you start to only look out for yourself. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4396.28s)]
*  And that's when I think things get really so bad. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4398.28s)]
*  Wouldn't people be leaving her left and right? [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4401.28s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4403.28s)]
*  All those people that said they were going to leave or whatever, and they're leaving, dude. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4404.28s)]
*  I wish they would leave. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4408.28s)]
*  I love I love this country. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4410.28s)]
*  And I it's it's look, do we do we have our flaws as a nation? [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4411.28s)]
*  We all. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4415.28s)]
*  Yeah, we have our flaws as human beings. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4416.28s)]
*  Everyone. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4418.28s)]
*  Look at the Jets. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4419.28s)]
*  Right. Yeah, I know. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4420.28s)]
*  I know. Jesus. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4421.28s)]
*  And but, you know, it's a great country. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4422.28s)]
*  It's it's something that people should be proud to live here. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4426.28s)]
*  And they should respect it. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4430.28s)]
*  And the fight isn't amongst ourselves. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4432.28s)]
*  You know, for us guys like me and our union members, it's like we were afforded freedoms [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4435.28s)]
*  because of that flag, because of the country we live in, where the enemy is not ourselves. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4441.28s)]
*  The enemy is corporate American crooked politicians. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4446.28s)]
*  It's fucking easy. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4448.28s)]
*  Yeah, it's weird when the enemy now is in your country, though. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4449.28s)]
*  That's the that's the thing that's gotten different. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4453.28s)]
*  You know, we used it used to be that you would, you know, your enemy was other countries [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4455.28s)]
*  or the countries you had conflict with. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4459.28s)]
*  And now it's gotten to be that the enemy is are running our country or they are in debt [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4461.28s)]
*  to people who are running our country. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4470.28s)]
*  You know, our leaders are in debt to our enemies. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4475.28s)]
*  That's what's gotten weird. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4478.28s)]
*  Our leaders are in debt to people who don't care about the morals of this country, you know, [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4479.28s)]
*  and who don't have any. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4484.28s)]
*  No, and it's it's there's got to be a solution to the problem, though. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4485.28s)]
*  That's what I hope, brother. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4488.28s)]
*  I fucking hope, dude, I will fucking chew the tires off somebody's asshole, brother. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4490.28s)]
*  I get I fucking hope that we can change things, dude. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4495.28s)]
*  You know, and I think there's a lot of guys out there who can, you know. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4498.28s)]
*  So that phrase you just said chew the tires off someone's asshole. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4501.28s)]
*  So if I had to interpret that in a Boston interpretation, what do you think that would be? [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4505.28s)]
*  Oh, man. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4510.28s)]

*  They're in there running it all night. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4562.28s)]
*  But yeah, they got the guy in the back who's still got he's got a you know, he's got a couple of horsemen left in a stable back there. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4564.28s)]
*  And every now and then. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4571.28s)]
*  There's some thoroughbreds back there. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4572.28s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4573.28s)]
*  Every now and then he'll sound off, you know? [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4574.28s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4576.28s)]
*  Every now and then somebody will. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4577.28s)]
*  You know what's good about that place? [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4578.28s)]
*  Every now and then, yeah, they put him in a Vince Will Ford jersey back there and he'll fucking start rattling around. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4579.28s)]
*  Back in the day, that place used to be great because you come out of the bars in Fanule Hall or North Station and that was the only place open. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4584.28s)]
*  And, you know, after drinking 35 beers, it's a good idea to fucking eat a couple of cannolis and a little Tiramisu. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4591.28s)]
*  But then you then you end up in the corner and you end up fucking getting in a fight argument. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4599.28s)]
*  It was like it was like WWE after eating cannolis and Italian pastry. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4603.28s)]
*  It was WWE Claire's. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4607.28s)]

*  Oh, it's crazy. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4615.28s)]
*  One guy's got a fucking apple Cruella just slammed him in his throat. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4616.28s)]
*  It's funny. I live right now there and it's still it's still open. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4619.28s)]

*  Now, my son that you met today, he's a type one diabetic. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4658.28s)]
*  Is he? [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4661.28s)]
*  And he always tells us joke, right? [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4662.28s)]
*  But like, see that stuff right there on the website? [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4664.28s)]
*  It's pretty sad when I can save his life. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4667.28s)]
*  Oh, forget CPR. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4670.28s)]
*  That'll save his life. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4671.28s)]
*  Put a little Cruella in him. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4672.28s)]
*  Put a fucking little bit of Boston cream in his snout. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4674.28s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4677.28s)]
*  Bring him back to life, brother. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4678.28s)]
*  That fucking sugar gnar can, homie. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4680.28s)]
*  That poor kid has diabetes. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4682.28s)]
*  He's politicians. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4683.28s)]
*  Have fucking liabilities. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4684.28s)]
*  That's a good point, dude. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4687.28s)]
*  Oh, I hope you almost it's almost weird because you're almost like, [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4689.28s)]
*  will some country come and rescue us? [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4692.28s)]
*  But it's our own country, you know? [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4694.28s)]
*  It's like, that's the part that we got to rescue ourselves from ourselves. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4696.28s)]
*  We do. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4700.28s)]
*  We do. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4701.28s)]
*  But it's definitely greed is one of the biggest things. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4702.28s)]
*  So with the with the country kind of divided in, even with the union having different views in politics, [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4705.28s)]
*  how do you keep the union unified? [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4710.28s)]
*  Like, is it tough to do or is it? [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4712.28s)]
*  No, I mean, the one thing the one thing that's important is, you know, the inclusiveness of the union. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4714.28s)]
*  You know, we're not we're not a dictatorship. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4719.28s)]
*  Our leadership is something that's never been done where we are out there myself and, you know, [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4721.28s)]
*  my general secretary, treasurer, my partner and all this, Fred Zuckerman. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4728.28s)]
*  We are actually out three, four days per week in work sites all around the country. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4731.28s)]
*  We're not talking to leaders. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4736.28s)]
*  We're not talking. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4737.28s)]
*  We're talking to we are talking to rank and file members in every industry we represent. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4738.28s)]
*  And look, this this political shit that's going on right now, the president presidential race, it's important. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4742.28s)]
*  But what we do is represent workers. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4748.28s)]
*  That's the most important thing. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4751.28s)]
*  So what do we do to to to to keep them unified? [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4752.28s)]
*  Negotiate the best contracts. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4755.28s)]
*  Be out there. Be visible. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4757.28s)]
*  Be transparent. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4758.28s)]
*  Be inclusive. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4759.28s)]
*  But more importantly, be honest with them. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4760.28s)]
*  You know, you know, the part of the part of the issue with a lot of a lot of situation we've been through over [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4764.28s)]
*  the last two and a half years is in the success we've had is because we've been honest with our members and we've [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4772.28s)]
*  we've empowered them. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4777.28s)]
*  You know, we've empowered them where they know we have their backs. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4778.28s)]
*  We they know that if they want to take on a fight, OK, we're ready to go. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4782.28s)]
*  You know, there's no ifs, ands or buts about it. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4787.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4790.28s)]
*  And should every worker be part of a union? [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4791.28s)]
*  Do you think I think every worker should be part of a union? [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4793.28s)]
*  I mean, look, think about it. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4795.28s)]
*  You know, we set the tone nationwide on, you know, industry standards. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4798.28s)]
*  And look, everybody should have health care. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4803.28s)]
*  They don't have to pay for that. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4806.28s)]
*  An employer is paying for everybody should have a pension that they can retire on and actually maintain their quality of life while they're retired. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4807.28s)]
*  So, yeah, everybody should have that. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4815.28s)]
*  That's the American dream. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4817.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4818.28s)]
*  And unions, it would feel like are especially disadvantaged because even because their health care costs go up year over year and those costs get levied out to the members. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4819.28s)]
*  The members have to even if their salaries going up, the cost of the health care is going up the same or similar. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4831.28s)]
*  So it's it's it all washes out, you know, like I was reading the other day about there was a union 32 BJ. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4837.28s)]
*  I think it is 32 BJ. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4846.28s)]
*  SEIU, yes, which has workers paying 37 percent of their compensation of their earnings for health care. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4848.28s)]
*  The members spent what you're saying is the members spent 37 million towards the cost of some of their premium that they pay in the health insurance. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4857.28s)]
*  See, with us, we know that 30 percent that 37 percent of their compensation goes towards health care. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4864.28s)]
*  Yeah. So they're paying a cost part of their compensation towards their health care. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4870.28s)]
*  Health care. We go into every single negotiation. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4874.28s)]
*  The majority of our members in the big industries do not pay anything towards the premium. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4877.28s)]
*  The employers, we demand that they pay the full. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4884.28s)]
*  Now, there are some industries that pay, you know, certain percentage towards it like public sector. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4887.28s)]
*  But we get the ability to negotiate that. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4893.28s)]
*  You know, we get the ability to negotiate free health care and stuff like that. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4896.28s)]
*  That's important this day and age because again, you get back to big business. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4899.28s)]
*  You know, we're out there fighting for the best benefits for our members health care. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4904.28s)]
*  We want zero to low cost. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4907.28s)]
*  And who's making all the money? These fucking providers like, you know, the insurance company, Blue Cross, Blue Shields of the world, you know, the Kaisers of the world. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4910.28s)]
*  And, you know, they act like they're providing us all these great benefits. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4918.28s)]
*  We're fighting for them. And they're actually a vendor to us. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4923.28s)]
*  So with some and some instances, we're the customer. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4926.28s)]
*  We're investing in our own demise in certain situations. Right. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4929.28s)]
*  So, you know, we've tried to change that narrative as well. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4932.28s)]
*  But, yeah, it's a disgrace. That's a disgrace. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4935.28s)]
*  Yeah. And I read an article that in New Jersey, police, fire and teachers unions are expecting a 20 percent increase in their health care premium premiums for 2025. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4938.28s)]
*  I mean, you know, so you take a wage increase that's, you know, you get a five percent wage increase. Right. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4954.28s)]
*  But your health insurance goes up 20 percent. Right. That's what you just lost money. Right. Right. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4960.28s)]
*  And why you shouldn't be losing money. No, it's all part of the same scam. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4964.28s)]
*  It's like, yeah, well, OK, we'll give you an increase, but this is going to be even higher than that. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4968.28s)]
*  So we know we're going to get the money back. So think about this. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4971.28s)]
*  You get a teacher that is responsible for cultivating the next generation, educating that next generation. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4974.28s)]
*  Yeah. You get a firefighter that's running into a burning building to save your children. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4981.28s)]
*  And you're in health care. And you have a police officer that's risking his life every single day with zero support from communities. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4986.28s)]
*  Now, except a Marlboro neck brace. Yeah. Right. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4992.28s)]
*  And yeah, right. Exactly. Right. And you want them to pay more for their health insurance. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=4994.28s)]
*  Are you out of your fucking minds? It's literally going to get to the point, Sean, where you're literally going to have to smoke for medical care. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5000.28s)]
*  It's going to be like, all right, if you want an IV, it's twenty thousand Marlboro. Yeah. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5006.28s)]
*  Yeah. You want to Tylenol, you got to smoke a fucking cotton of cigarettes, break them off. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5011.28s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy. But imagine those people. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5015.28s)]
*  You'll see a full body, like just a full body Winston cast, you know, just a full body parliament cast. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5017.28s)]
*  You know, this costs thirty thousand. Tarrantin one hundred. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5023.28s)]
*  Miles and miles. Oh, God. That must have been a boss. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5026.28s)]
*  That must have been a boss. My grandmother, my grandmother used to smoke Tarrantin one hundredth. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5029.28s)]
*  Right. And she had like a three inch ash and he'd be sitting there. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5035.28s)]
*  I'd be like, all right, when's this going to light the couch on fire? Oh, no. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5040.28s)]
*  When is it going to light the divan on fire? I don't know what the divan. Yeah, I didn't know what it was. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5043.28s)]
*  The divan. Yeah. Well, yeah, my grandmother called it a divan. Yeah, whatever it was. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5047.28s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, they both had it wrong. Smoking butts. Oh, they all smoked for pregnancy. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5051.28s)]
*  Right. Oh, yeah, brother. Oh, you'd see a kid be born. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5055.28s)]
*  He'd be, you know, four ounces. You know what I'm saying? [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5058.28s)]
*  Yeah. She put him in. My grandmother put my brother in a curio cabinet. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5061.28s)]
*  It was it was craving like fucking tab tab cola. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5064.28s)]
*  Dude, they had a fuck. What was I going to say? My brain's not working good today, man. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5068.28s)]
*  Some days it's on. Some days it's off. You know, it's union. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5073.28s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? Might be on an off shift. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5076.28s)]
*  But hey, but hey, bro, it's part of the union, dude. Hey, FMLA. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5080.28s)]
*  Hey, it knows it knows no matter what that it's going to it's going to be rewarded. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5083.28s)]
*  FMLA Friday, Monday Leave Act. Yeah. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5087.28s)]
*  What was what else was I going to ask you? Yeah. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5094.28s)]
*  Why do every why does every did we already ask this? [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5097.28s)]
*  Why does every worker need a contract with their employer? [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5100.28s)]
*  Well, because, look, if you don't have a contract, right. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5103.28s)]
*  And I tell us to people all the time we're organizing workers because, you know, [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5106.28s)]
*  we have these meetings with groups that want to organize and you always get people that don't want to organize, right. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5109.28s)]
*  They want to be friends with the boss or they think that they're being taken care of. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5115.28s)]
*  And I always tell them, look, take a piece of paper, write down all your demands, [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5118.28s)]
*  write down your guarantees like I, Sean O'Brien demand for my boss and my boss will provide for me. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5123.28s)]
*  Seven percent wage increase every year. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5129.28s)]
*  Free health care, job security, respect in the workplace. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5131.28s)]
*  And if you give that to your boss that you're not organized, you think he's going to sign that? [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5134.28s)]
*  Absolutely not. There's no guarantees. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5139.28s)]
*  Right. Well, the union contract, you're guaranteed, you're guaranteed. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5141.28s)]
*  Yaelian wage increases, you're guaranteed medical, you're guaranteed retirement, you're guaranteed holidays, you're guaranteed vacations. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5145.28s)]
*  It's simple. It's easy. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5152.28s)]
*  You know, and that's the litmus test. Hey, you don't believe us? [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5154.28s)]
*  Then everything that you want, write it down as a contract. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5156.28s)]
*  You individually go give it to your employer and I guarantee you one or two things are going to happen. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5160.28s)]
*  He's going to laugh at you and then he's going to fire you. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5164.28s)]
*  Damn. And now in smaller businesses it might be different. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5167.28s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, look, there's a lot of smaller businesses that actually take care of their employees that, you know, [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5171.28s)]
*  we've had instances where, you know, you've had a small business, you know, a couple of people come to you and, you know, [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5176.28s)]
*  and when you get into the weeds, deep down in the weeds, you see that, you know, these, you know, [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5185.28s)]
*  this might not be a great opportunity for a union and or an employer that is actually doing the right thing by the members. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5190.28s)]
*  That's the one thing that people lose sight of is what we do as a whole, holds other people accountable. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5198.28s)]
*  So what we get as a union may encourage these small employers to do the right thing selfishly to keep us out. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5204.28s)]
*  Right. So we do set that bar pretty high. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5213.28s)]
*  But there's a lot of family owned businesses that, you know, that I know of, especially in my area where I grew up, [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5216.28s)]
*  where, you know, they take care of their employers. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5222.28s)]
*  You know, I have a friend of mine, Paul Nazzaro, who started his own business and he sold it for a lot of money [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5224.28s)]
*  that he'd probably never asked to work again. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5232.28s)]
*  But he's an example where he always took care of it was a small like tech company. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5234.28s)]
*  And when he left, he had an employee that worked for him for 35 years on a forklift. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5239.28s)]
*  He gave him a $500,000 check. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5244.28s)]
*  Wow. Just, you know, stuff like that. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5246.28s)]
*  So there's our good stories out there. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5248.28s)]
*  But, you know, the majority of people, you know, and again, I'll stand by it. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5250.28s)]
*  I think everybody should have the ability to join a union without retaliation or retribution. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5253.28s)]
*  Yeah. And again, but there are a lot of good employers that small businesses, family run, [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5258.28s)]
*  that have done well and have rewarded the people. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5263.28s)]
*  You know, it's not every employer is bad because they're non-union. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5266.28s)]
*  Yeah, man. Speaking of forklifts, I used to work over, I used to work at this place. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5269.28s)]
*  We was galvanizing clevis clamps or something, some bullshit. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5273.28s)]
*  I don't know. I got really bad summer and doing it because we had to do it outdoors or whatever, [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5276.28s)]
*  because we weren't unionized or whatever. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5280.28s)]
*  But yeah, we'd be out there galvanizing shit in the sun. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5282.28s)]
*  And, oh, at lunch sometimes we would get real high and like we would put each other on that pallet. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5285.28s)]
*  On a forklift and then put it all the way to the top and get the highest dude [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5295.28s)]
*  and just put him way up there and leave him up there while he went Nate. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5300.28s)]
*  You guys definitely needed a union. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5304.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5306.28s)]
*  Was it the junior guy or the senior guy you put up there? [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5307.28s)]
*  No, it was a low on the totem pole guy. It was me. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5311.28s)]
*  Did they drug test at that company? [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5315.28s)]
*  Uh-uh. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5316.28s)]
*  Did they drug test at that company? [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5317.28s)]
*  Fuck no. But you knew people were on drugs. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5318.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5320.28s)]
*  So you didn't have to test. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5321.28s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Just you already knew it. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5322.28s)]
*  Yeah. It was just kind of baked in. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5324.28s)]
*  Was it like a prerequisite? [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5325.28s)]
*  Yeah. I don't know if it was or not, but it was baked in. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5326.28s)]
*  Yeah. That's the one thing that we do when we stand by. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5328.28s)]
*  Everybody's got to get drug tested? [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5331.28s)]
*  For the most part, most of our members do, which is a good thing. You don't want to. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5333.28s)]
*  Do you guys use USADA? Who do you guys use? [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5335.28s)]
*  I don't even know. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5339.28s)]
*  Oh, you don't? [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5340.28s)]
*  No. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5341.28s)]
*  USADA? [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5342.28s)]
*  No. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5343.28s)]
*  They're a big drug testing company. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5344.28s)]
*  Oh, one of America's greatest mysteries is the Hoffa mystery, right? [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5346.28s)]
*  So we got to ask about that, you know, and what happened to him, right? [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5349.28s)]
*  Because he was the Teamsters president. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5353.28s)]
*  He was. He was, well, there was the father and then junior. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5354.28s)]
*  The father was an icon. I mean, he put the Teamsters on the map. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5358.28s)]
*  Did you ever meet the father? [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5362.28s)]
*  I didn't. No, he was. I was born in 1972. He disappeared in 75. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5363.28s)]
*  No, but my, I know a lot of people that did out of my local and everything else. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5369.28s)]
*  And, you know, he was an icon. He really was the greatest labor leader ever. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5374.28s)]
*  And he put the Teamsters and organized labor on the map. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5380.28s)]
*  And then he went missing, right? [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5384.28s)]
*  Yep. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5386.28s)]
*  Do you think he's still alive or not? [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5387.28s)]
*  I mean, he'd be 105 or something like that. So I don't know. Probably not. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5388.28s)]
*  He's getting overtime. If he is. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5392.28s)]
*  Yeah, he might. Yeah, I mean, he's probably on the clock still. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5394.28s)]
*  Probably on the clock. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5396.28s)]
*  Or yeah, do you think he's still on the clock? That's probably the appropriate term. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5397.28s)]
*  Dude, once you become president, do they tell you what happened to him because he went missing? [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5400.28s)]
*  No one knows what happens to him. I mean, that's the biggest mystery. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5404.28s)]
*  There's all these theories that, you know, you got killed by the mob. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5406.28s)]
*  There's all these theories that, you know, he's buried under a giant stadium. No one knows. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5409.28s)]
*  I mean, you know, all the theories. But the one thing that is like, look, he's gone, [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5414.28s)]
*  but the work that he did should never be forgotten. I mean, that guy. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5418.28s)]
*  Yeah, he's buried under a Dunkin Donuts out in Newton or whatever. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5422.28s)]
*  Yeah, probably South Medford or something. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5425.28s)]
*  But yeah, there's always, you're like, we're not digging up another Dunkin Donuts out here. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5427.28s)]
*  We got munchkins to make. But no, I mean, it's unfortunate what happened. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5432.28s)]
*  But, you know, back then, I mean, you know, the team says it was a very controversial, [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5437.28s)]
*  very influential organization, which I think today we're not as controversial, [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5444.28s)]
*  but we're just as much influential. And no, I don't, I get asked this question all the time. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5449.28s)]
*  I'm sure we had to ask. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5454.28s)]
*  But I'll tell you one thing, fascinating thing in my office. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5455.28s)]
*  And I'm in the same office that he had and then his son. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5458.28s)]
*  His son, Jimmy P. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5464.28s)]
*  James P. Hoffman. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5466.28s)]
*  James P. Hoffman. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5467.28s)]
*  James P. Hoffman. Yeah, definitely not his father. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5468.28s)]
*  You know, was born on third base and actually thinks he hit a triple to get there. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5472.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5476.28s)]
*  You know, great name recognition, right? [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5477.28s)]
*  But in my office, you have, it's been all done over. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5479.28s)]
*  But the one thing is, there's a little closet in my office that, you know, [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5484.28s)]
*  they kept part of the history and you open the closet door, [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5487.28s)]
*  there's a little closet door on the hallway. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5490.28s)]
*  And there's actually a two rail tape recorder that's still there. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5492.28s)]
*  So he used to tape record all his conversations in his office and listen to him. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5499.28s)]
*  You weren't, you didn't even know you were getting taped. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5504.28s)]
*  So it's actually still there. It doesn't function. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5506.28s)]
*  But, you know, it's funny, Bobby Kennedy tells a great story and it is true. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5509.28s)]
*  You know, there's no, there's no love lost between Jimmy Hoffa Senior and Bobby Kennedy's father. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5515.28s)]
*  Actually, this is the, if you see this, that's President Hoffa at a Senate hearing. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5523.28s)]
*  Flipping him off. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5528.28s)]
*  Flipping off Robert Kennedy, right? [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5529.28s)]
*  But Robert Kennedy Jr. tells a story how he's driving past our headquarters and with his father, [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5532.28s)]
*  he was probably 14 years old. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5540.28s)]
*  He was probably 14 years old and he's driving past our building. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5542.28s)]
*  And his father, his father had like a vendetta against Hoffa. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5546.28s)]
*  And he saw that he was in there like nine o'clock at night working, the lights was on. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5550.28s)]
*  So he dropped Bobby off and said, I got to go back to work. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5554.28s)]
*  If he's working this late, he's preparing, I got to prepare. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5557.28s)]
*  So it was funny, the story. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5560.28s)]
*  But, you know, he was definitely an icon and he made the team, says what it is today. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5562.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5566.28s)]
*  You know, I had a fallen out with his son who, you know, as far as I'm concerned, you know, [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5567.28s)]
*  he didn't do what was right towards the end of the union. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5572.28s)]
*  And that's the great thing about having a Democratic union. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5575.28s)]
*  And does everybody's vote in the union count for the same? [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5579.28s)]
*  All our rank and file members vote. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5582.28s)]
*  Yeah, we're one of the only unions where one voice, one vote. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5584.28s)]
*  Each each one of our rank and file members gets the opportunity to vote on their leadership. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5588.28s)]
*  And so now every union member can vote for also for any president that they want or any election. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5594.28s)]
*  Whoever's running, whoever's declared candidate, they can they can vote for whoever they want. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5599.28s)]
*  So most of the time we run as Slates. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5603.28s)]
*  So you'll have like the Sean O'Brien Slate or the like I think we had. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5606.28s)]
*  It's the Oz, the O'Brien, Zuckerman, Slate. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5609.28s)]
*  And we had our opponents last time were membership Slate or something like that. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5612.28s)]
*  And, you know, you run as a Slate a team. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5617.28s)]
*  24. How often do you have to run every five years, every five years? [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5620.28s)]
*  Yeah. So we ran in 2000. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5624.28s)]
*  Our election was in November of 2021 and we take over March of 2022. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5627.28s)]
*  So we'll have another election in November of 26 and take all, you know, obviously gets sworn in for another term, [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5635.28s)]
*  hopefully in March of twenty twenty seven. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5641.28s)]
*  And do you have a campaign slogan or did you have like a campaign slogan? [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5644.28s)]
*  No, but I think, yeah, well, we did. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5647.28s)]
*  Yeah. Bigger, faster, stronger. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5649.28s)]
*  And I say it all the time. You know, we've got to be bigger. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5650.28s)]
*  We've got to be faster. We've got to be stronger. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5652.28s)]
*  And we definitely have. We definitely have done that. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5654.28s)]
*  Is the union growing? It's growing. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5657.28s)]
*  We've organized just the teams alone in two and a half years, organized 50,000 new members. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5658.28s)]
*  And we're organizing in different in traditional industries. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5663.28s)]
*  But I know for a fact, you've probably never done this. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5667.28s)]
*  You probably never smoked weed. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5670.28s)]
*  But we are organizing in the cannabis industry where there's four hundred and twenty five thousand W2 employees nationwide. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5672.28s)]
*  Bud slaves. They call them a lot of people are calling them. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5679.28s)]
*  Yeah, because they're not unionized. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5682.28s)]
*  No. And we have organized. I think we've got two thousand and hammocks. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5683.28s)]
*  We've got two thousand of them organized, I think, throughout the throughout the whole country. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5687.28s)]
*  So they're there to they're into cultivation. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5690.28s)]
*  There's workers that are in warehousing and then they're going to be in distribution. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5694.28s)]
*  So all in our will. So what we do in this four hundred and twenty five thousand of them. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5698.28s)]
*  Is that one of your largest growing sectors? [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5702.28s)]
*  It's well, yeah, the term or it's divisions. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5705.28s)]
*  Is that one of the largest growing divisions? [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5708.28s)]
*  Well, we're hopefully well, I mean, we're doing a lot of things differently where, you know, once this is legalized nationwide, [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5709.28s)]
*  which I think both candidates are supportive of legalizing it, you're going to see in the safe banking laws of change where, [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5716.28s)]
*  again, these companies can put money into actual banks. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5724.28s)]
*  You're going to see a private equity come out and try and buy up all these all these smaller companies where what we're doing is we're working with a private equity fund [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5727.28s)]
*  utilizing contributions from our pension funds and investments in our pension funds to be the buyer of them, to be the buyer of them. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5738.28s)]
*  Let's go. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5746.28s)]
*  And obviously, you know, organize within this industry. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5747.28s)]
*  So this four hundred and twenty five thousand. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5751.28s)]
*  Is it a conflict of interest? [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5754.28s)]
*  So to be an owner? [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5755.28s)]
*  No, we're not an owner would be the private equity firm that we invest in. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5756.28s)]
*  So it's not uncommon. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5760.28s)]
*  We do it all the time in other industries like would you still make the best deal for your. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5762.28s)]
*  Oh, we're going to make the best deal because think about it. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5766.28s)]
*  A lot of times in pension funds and health and welfare funds, we make investments off contributions because, you know, that's what you're supposed to do. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5769.28s)]
*  Right. And it's usually a pretty dynamic asset allocation. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5776.28s)]
*  You invest in real estate, you invest in private equity, you rest in stocks, you invest in bonds and stuff like that. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5779.28s)]
*  So our infrastructure. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5788.28s)]
*  So think about investing in a lot of times, especially with private equity. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5790.28s)]
*  You know, you're investing in competitors, non union competitors that could potentially put good companies out of business. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5797.28s)]
*  So we're taking a different look at it now and approach and say, look, why don't we invest in the industries that we actually represent? [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5805.28s)]
*  And instead of investing in our demise, we invest in areas where we can help. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5812.28s)]
*  So, for instance, 30 percent of this portfolio will be dedicated towards cannabis investment and the other 70 percent will be in all kinds of other investments. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5819.28s)]
*  Right. We're hoping to raise a billion dollars by January or February of 2025. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5828.28s)]
*  And that gives us the opportunity as well as like if there's a distressed company out there, like a small business that's unionized or even a big business like Yellow Freight who went out of business because they couldn't get financing because it was a greedy private equity firm known as Apollo. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5834.28s)]
*  If we had this fund up and running, you know, a couple of years ago, we could have bought Apollo's position out at six hundred million dollars, restructure the company and actually keep 22,000 jobs. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5849.28s)]
*  Right. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5860.28s)]
*  So we're doing creative, innovative stuff like that as well. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5861.28s)]
*  You know, you have to. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5864.28s)]
*  Oh, you have to. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5866.28s)]
*  Because, like I said, we're a lot more sophisticated and our members deserve deserve, you know, the investments we're going to make on their behalf and how like you look at the cannabis industry, for instance. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5867.28s)]
*  Right. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5880.28s)]
*  If it doesn't get organized, what future do people have going to work there? [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5881.28s)]
*  So we organize them. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5886.28s)]
*  We negotiate contracts that have health care, that have retirement benefits. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5888.28s)]
*  We're not just creating a job. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5893.28s)]
*  We're creating careers for people. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5896.28s)]
*  Right. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5898.28s)]
*  Cultivation, warehousing, distribution. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5899.28s)]
*  I mean, you know, that's what we should be doing. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5902.28s)]
*  Yeah, that's really interesting. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5905.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5907.28s)]
*  And I can't believe that's one of the biggest growing that that's one of the largest growing. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5908.28s)]
*  So there's saturated. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5912.28s)]
*  There's saturated. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5913.28s)]
*  Like one of the largest growing sectors for you. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5914.28s)]
*  Divisions. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5916.28s)]
*  They're saturated heavily with with licenses nationwide. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5917.28s)]
*  Right. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5920.28s)]
*  And that's a good thing. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5921.28s)]
*  But the capital poor right now. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5924.28s)]
*  So they're waiting for this, you know, legalization federally and the safe banking laws have changed. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5926.28s)]
*  And you're going to see, you know, a grab. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5932.28s)]
*  And if we're not controlling that grab, you know, the best interests of these workers are not going to be at hand. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5934.28s)]
*  So we want to make sure first and foremost, that's what we're doing. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5939.28s)]
*  We don't we're not we're not, you know, really concerned with, you know, doing double digit return on investments. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5942.28s)]
*  We're concerned on taking care of these workers that work in this industry and making certain that they have the ability to have a career if they choose. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5947.28s)]
*  But how crazy that's even come to that also that now in order to ensure that the workers are going to be safe, you that the company that the organization making them safe also wants to be a vested interest in the like, you know, I'm saying it makes sense. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5955.28s)]
*  You got to skin on the game. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5970.28s)]
*  It makes sense. But it's crazy that you would that people wouldn't just think, yes, we need to take care of the workers. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5971.28s)]
*  Yeah. Well, so again, you get back to corporate greed. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5977.28s)]
*  Yeah. You get back to a bottom line of a balance sheet before people. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5979.28s)]
*  Yeah, it's unreal, man. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5983.28s)]
*  And then there won't be any more people that will just be a robot and some, you know, you know, some I don't even know. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5985.28s)]
*  Just who knows? [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5992.28s)]
*  You know, some Israeli lizard licking a Bitcoin somewhere, jerking off in a bank vault. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=5994.28s)]
*  One of your most viral moments was you had a confrontation with a fella from Oklahoma. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6003.28s)]
*  Was he a senator? [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6011.28s)]
*  Yeah, US Senator Mark Wayne Mullen. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6012.28s)]
*  Mark Wayne Mullen. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6014.28s)]
*  And did you guys ever patch that up? [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6015.28s)]
*  Because you guys almost you guys almost did a charity fundraiser fight right there in the in the Senate. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6017.28s)]
*  Yeah, we had to two run ins, you know, one. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6024.28s)]
*  I'm not sure people know. I don't know. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6027.28s)]
*  We had two run ins like I was testifying in a Senate hearing at the request of Senator Bernie Sanders, who I got a lot of respect for him. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6029.28s)]
*  I'm a huge fan of. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6038.28s)]
*  And this guy like attacked me first. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6040.28s)]
*  What was he upset about? [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6043.28s)]
*  Well, so when you go into these hearings and again, like you we have to submit like a 15 page brief. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6044.28s)]
*  Right. So you give that 24 hours prior and then you've got to condense that in your testimony to about two and a half to three minutes. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6051.28s)]
*  So I'm reading my testimony and you know, usually have witnesses pro and con on each side. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6059.28s)]
*  That's and you have, you know, the Republicans on the Help Committee and the Democrats on the Help Committee. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6064.28s)]
*  And I didn't I didn't know this guy from a hole in the wall and he had an issue with a different union. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6070.28s)]
*  He owned a business of plumbing a pipe fitting company in Oklahoma. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6076.28s)]
*  And I guess they, you know, they picketed his house. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6079.28s)]
*  He had 300 employees or something. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6082.28s)]
*  So he took it very personal, which, you know, hey, someone shows up at your house that is personal. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6084.28s)]
*  But the reality of it has nothing to do with me. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6089.28s)]
*  So he started like attacking me on all this stuff. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6091.28s)]
*  And of course, being from Boston in the neighborhood, I'm like, fuck you, dude. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6094.28s)]
*  Like, whatever. Like, you're a clown. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6098.28s)]
*  I just started shitting on him. He started shitting on me back. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6100.28s)]
*  Right. And poor Bernie, like I thought he popped a nitro. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6103.28s)]
*  He was like, enough, enough, enough. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6106.28s)]
*  And so that was, yeah, I was like, you know what it was like? [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6108.28s)]
*  It was like, you know, you're sneaking in your grandmother's house in high school because you're drinking and your grandfather's up screaming at you. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6111.28s)]
*  But I felt bad for him. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6117.28s)]
*  And then so that was a big bomb, a sip of liquor. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6119.28s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6121.28s)]
*  You're like, this is definitely. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6123.28s)]
*  You got a Marlboro? I'm two points shy. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6125.28s)]
*  Right. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6127.28s)]
*  So this is insider trade. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6129.28s)]
*  So we get into this big exchange and then I didn't know who he was. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6131.28s)]
*  It was it was actually Carmichael. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6134.28s)]
*  That was the first time. And then so after that, of course, I start attacking him on social media and he starts attacking me back and we're going back and forth. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6136.28s)]
*  So then I have to testify another hearing and he come in and he I can he was all fired up, you know, because clearly I hit a few nerves. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6145.28s)]
*  And he's like, stand your butt up. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6152.28s)]
*  And I'm like, you stand your butt up. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6154.28s)]
*  I am fucking because you want to do this. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6156.28s)]
*  We'll do it right now. I'm like, let's do it. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6158.28s)]
*  And they didn't let you all fight that long. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6160.28s)]
*  No, I was like, you know, it was like, you know, I played a little bit of hockey and like, I don't even think I could jump over the boards anymore. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6162.28s)]
*  But, you know, if I got over there and he got over, I mean, it's on. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6169.28s)]
*  But, you know, it and poor Bernie, you know, he's yelling and everything else. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6172.28s)]
*  I saw that clip. Yeah. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6178.28s)]
*  I mean, he was he called me the next day. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6180.28s)]
*  He goes, did you have fun? [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6182.28s)]
*  I go, I had a fucking blast to be honest with you. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6184.28s)]
*  Right. And so then as time went on, you know, Mullins people and my people were bumping into each other up at Capitol Hill and they all determined it would be in the best interest. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6186.28s)]
*  If, you know, we sat down and, you know, try to air our differences if we couldn't air our differences, whatever. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6199.28s)]
*  But, you know, he challenged me to a fight like a charity fight. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6205.28s)]
*  He's supposed to be an MMA fighter. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6208.28s)]
*  And I'm like, dude, I walk to work. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6210.28s)]
*  I'll just meet you in a park, you know, and we'll see what happens. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6212.28s)]
*  But thankfully, it didn't get to that both sides and, you know, I'll be honest with you. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6215.28s)]
*  Like I met with him. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6220.28s)]
*  We agree to disagree on a lot of things, but, you know, he's a sitting US senator, one of a hundred should be well respected people. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6221.28s)]
*  I get the privilege of representing 1.3 million working people. [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6231.28s)]
*  You know, we both probably could have done things differently that day, but it was fucking fun as hell. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6235.28s)]
*  It was fun. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6239.28s)]
*  Yeah, it was good. And it was it was great because you need some of that shit because C-SPAN or whatever that channel is fucking boring. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6240.28s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6246.28s)]
*  I'm lying to you. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6248.28s)]
*  Yeah. And you don't even know what's going on on there. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6249.28s)]
*  You know, every now and then. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6251.28s)]
*  C-SPAN is awful. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6252.28s)]
*  It's like it's like watching old people, you know, hump. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6253.28s)]
*  And they're all. Yeah. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6256.28s)]
*  I mean, yeah, if you've done it. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6258.28s)]
*  No, I haven't ever done that. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6261.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6262.28s)]
*  Never watch that stuff. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6263.28s)]
*  Long as you're not watching. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6267.28s)]
*  But maybe I'll watch the Golden Bachelorette now or something, you know. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6268.28s)]
*  As long as you're not watching it on the clock. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6272.28s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6274.28s)]
*  Be in the break room. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6275.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6276.28s)]
*  The break room is always so much fucking fun, dude. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6277.28s)]
*  I'll tell you this, and I've definitely stolen from my employers. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6280.28s)]
*  I used to work at the grocery right now as a checkout guy. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6285.28s)]
*  Right. We did stocking and checking out. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6288.28s)]
*  And then I got moved up to checker and bagger to do. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6290.28s)]
*  And I got up and when I go to the break room. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6293.28s)]
*  Checker or bagger baggers. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6298.28s)]
*  Bagger sounds a little deviant. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6302.28s)]
*  Yeah. Baggers definitely. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6304.28s)]
*  Why used to I used to if it was rich people, I would ring their items up a couple of times. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6306.28s)]
*  And then when poor people came through, I wouldn't ring their items up. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6311.28s)]
*  But I remember like, OK, I got three boxes of cereal. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6314.28s)]
*  So you like a modern day Robin Hood at Publix? [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6316.28s)]
*  I mean, yeah, I was, you know, what? [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6319.28s)]
*  Anything big. It was just some fucking cinnamon toast crotch or whatever. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6321.28s)]
*  But I definitely helped out here and there. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6324.28s)]
*  You know, did what you could because some families, they didn't notice it. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6326.28s)]
*  You know, it's still it's still stealing. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6329.28s)]
*  But what we used to do is when we go to break, we would walk down like our fate, whatever aisle had our favorite food. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6331.28s)]
*  And we just steal some shit right off the shelves. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6336.28s)]
*  So that's I feel sorry about that. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6338.28s)]
*  I want to apologize. That place is called Dell Champs. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6340.28s)]
*  I think went out of business and then. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6342.28s)]
*  Do you think it went out of business because of the employee pilfering or? [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6345.28s)]
*  I don't know. I didn't take much. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6348.28s)]
*  I usually took Swedish fish and shit. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6350.28s)]
*  No, I do like a banana, maybe a little bag of fungans or something. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6352.28s)]
*  Not one of the big bags. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6355.28s)]
*  But yeah, it was just everybody did it. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6357.28s)]
*  But see, that's not a bad. That's not a fair thing. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6359.28s)]
*  Everybody does it. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6361.28s)]
*  It just implicated all your coworkers. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6363.28s)]
*  Oh, dude, definitely all of them. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6365.28s)]
*  Chad, Giddy, all those dudes. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6367.28s)]
*  This one dude used to come clock in, go home. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6369.28s)]
*  He worked for us for four months. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6372.28s)]
*  That's funny. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6374.28s)]
*  Like, who is he? [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6375.28s)]
*  People would come to work and like, where is he? [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6377.28s)]
*  They came at a piece of picture of picture of one day. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6379.28s)]
*  Where is he? This kid named Chuckie or whatever. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6381.28s)]
*  We're like, who is he? [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6383.28s)]
*  And like your employee, you're going to rat him out. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6384.28s)]
*  I'm like, I don't even fucking we never see. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6387.28s)]
*  We don't know him to rat him out. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6389.28s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6391.28s)]
*  But yeah, working at a grocery store was fun. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6392.28s)]
*  Do you see more? Do you see the union growing now? [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6395.28s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. I mean, we can joke about like the brakes and all that. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6398.28s)]
*  Oh, yeah, for sure. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6401.28s)]
*  But unions have proved they're the hardest work and most productive workers in the country. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6402.28s)]
*  And I think this new generation, you know, that have an appetite to fight [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6407.28s)]
*  and they want to take on the boss and, you know, they're very in tune with social media. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6414.28s)]
*  And I think there's a great opportunity. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6419.28s)]
*  I mean, when you see places like Starbucks and Chipotle and all these industries [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6422.28s)]
*  that have never been unionized, where the young workers that are 18, 19, 20 years old, [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6428.28s)]
*  demanding recognition, demanding representation in the workplace, [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6433.28s)]
*  I think the sky's the limit. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6436.28s)]
*  And I think, again, it sets the tone for the next 10 or 15 years in the labor movement. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6437.28s)]
*  We definitely have seen growth in the teamsters [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6444.28s)]
*  and a lot of those industries that have never been represented. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6447.28s)]
*  You know, it's exciting times. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6453.28s)]
*  Yeah, I know. It definitely seems like it. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6456.28s)]
*  Well, we're just seeing as more big businesses and things become conglomerates and stuff like that. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6458.28s)]
*  Yeah, the last thing you have is it almost seems like it's the last choice, you know, [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6463.28s)]
*  and it's the best choice. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6471.28s)]
*  You know, you have to have somebody fight against these groups for you. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6472.28s)]
*  This article says this summer alone, 10,000 workers are organized with the teamsters [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6475.28s)]
*  for the first time in a wide range of employers and traditional teamsters [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6479.28s)]
*  industries like transportation and delivery, including DHL. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6482.28s)]
*  Oh, we were already talking about that. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6486.28s)]
*  Yeah, so do you think that, oh, it says also including Amazon, the American Red Cross, [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6488.28s)]
*  Costco and cannabis dispensary nationwide. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6494.28s)]
*  So it's everywhere. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6497.28s)]
*  Yeah, we are. We're hitting every single opportunity. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6500.28s)]
*  We don't solicit. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6503.28s)]
*  We have targets, you know, like Amazon, because they're such a bad employer. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6504.28s)]
*  But DHL, like we represent DHL around the country. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6510.28s)]
*  Some places were unionized, some weren't. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6514.28s)]
*  So what we did is we just started striking them for recognition. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6516.28s)]
*  And we shut them down at CVG, which is the airport in Cincinnati last December, right? [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6519.28s)]
*  Right during the busiest time for them. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6526.28s)]
*  And what we did there, there was 2,300 workers. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6528.28s)]
*  We got a first time contract there for 1,300 workers and the remaining 1,100, [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6531.28s)]
*  we got KAD-check neutrality, which they didn't want to give us. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6536.28s)]
*  But we said, look, no problem. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6539.28s)]
*  Next December, we're going to do the same thing to you. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6540.28s)]
*  We'll shut you down. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6542.28s)]
*  And the good thing for us, once you have a union contract for the most part, [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6543.28s)]
*  whether it's DHL, UPS, UNFI, Cisco, any of those, [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6546.28s)]
*  we have what they call picket line protection. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6550.28s)]
*  So we get to own a picket lines all over the place. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6552.28s)]
*  So we can extend picket lines at different locations and shut down industries nationwide. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6554.28s)]
*  And again, that's a choice that an employer makes that they shouldn't make. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6559.28s)]
*  And we've been successful doing that. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6563.28s)]
*  So as a result of that, DHL is funny. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6566.28s)]
*  I think they are owned by the Deutsche Post Office, I believe. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6568.28s)]
*  I remember when they showed up with those yellow trucks. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6573.28s)]
*  Yeah, they're off of the Kansas City Chiefs. [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6576.28s)]
*  What's going on? [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6578.28s)]
*  So we organized. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6579.28s)]
*  But again, they're a European company. [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6581.28s)]
*  And I met with the CEO after we struck them. [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6585.28s)]
*  And he's like, we want to reestablish our relationship. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6588.28s)]
*  And I'm like, OK, give us KAD-check neutrality. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6591.28s)]
*  What is KAD-check neutrality? [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6594.28s)]
*  It means they just agree to, once we get the majority of the employees to sign cards, [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6595.28s)]
*  we give them to a third party arbitrator who decides the validity of the cards. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6599.28s)]
*  And then if we have the majority, they sit down and negotiate a contract with us. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6604.28s)]
*  There's nothing else they can do. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6608.28s)]
*  What do you mean, validity of the cards? What do you mean? [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6610.28s)]
*  Like, the arbitrator will determine if we do have the majority or not. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6612.28s)]
*  And we don't usually submit these cards to an arbitrator unless we have 80% of the cards. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6617.28s)]
*  And so the cards mean people saying... [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6621.28s)]
*  People signed up. I want to join the union. [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6622.28s)]
*  So they'll determine that. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6624.28s)]
*  And then they sit down and negotiate a contract. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6626.28s)]
*  So we had a meeting in Washington. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6628.28s)]
*  They sent these three, the CEO, their lawyer, and the CFO. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6630.28s)]
*  And I went with our attorney, Fred Zuckerman. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6634.28s)]
*  I'm a general secretary treasurer. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6638.28s)]
*  We sat down and they're like, we want to reestablish the relationship. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6640.28s)]
*  One guy had an English accent and really fucking aggravating. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6643.28s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6647.28s)]
*  It was like... [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6648.28s)]
*  Good day. We'll see about it. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6649.28s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. All that bullshit. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6651.28s)]
*  This pisses me off. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6653.28s)]
*  Well, we want to have a relationship. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6654.28s)]
*  I go, well, the only way we're going to have a relationship, you give us card check neutrality. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6655.28s)]
*  And he said, yeah, we don't believe in that. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6659.28s)]
*  I'm like, okay, great. Meeting's over. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6660.28s)]
*  I'm not going to beg for this. Go fuck yourself. See you later. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6662.28s)]
*  And then like two days later, our attorney's on the phone and their attorney's like, [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6665.28s)]
*  we rethought this because we told them we'll just shut you down every chance we got. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6669.28s)]
*  And you don't want to be like that, but when they come in and especially, [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6672.28s)]
*  they're not an American company. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6676.28s)]
*  They could give two shits less about us. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6678.28s)]
*  We've reestablished our relationship where we've made them realize how important their work is [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6680.28s)]
*  and how important a relationship is with the teamsters. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6686.28s)]
*  So we've been successful there. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6689.28s)]
*  And look, we'll work with anybody. [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6691.28s)]
*  Say in the weed organization, right? [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6694.28s)]
*  Say the people that work for weed companies, how do they become part of the union? [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6696.28s)]
*  How does someone who's working somewhere who feels like, okay, I'm not supported [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6701.28s)]
*  or maybe I'm at a place that should be supported, [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6705.28s)]
*  how do they approach you guys to be, hopefully potentially be part of the union? [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6709.28s)]
*  They'll go to a local union like a teamsters local and they'll, you know, [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6716.28s)]
*  Okay, so start at a local level. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6720.28s)]
*  They'll go to a local level, talk to the local union. [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6722.28s)]
*  Local union will either send in their organizer, we'll provide an organizer for them. [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6725.28s)]
*  They'll go out, talk to the workers, establish a relationship, establish trust, [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6729.28s)]
*  and have them sign authorization cards, meaning they want to join the union. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6734.28s)]
*  And especially in the cannabis industry, I think we've gotten more card check recognition [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6738.28s)]
*  because I think two things, they know that, you know, we can strike them for recognition. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6744.28s)]
*  And two, they know that we have this ability to, you know, [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6749.28s)]
*  make investments in their businesses as time goes on once this fund is created. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6754.28s)]
*  And it's good. It's good for the industry because think about it. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6759.28s)]
*  We're going to regulate that industry, right? [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6762.28s)]
*  So if we don't organize them, you know, the mom and pop that are charging X amount, [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6764.28s)]
*  and I've never done drugs in my life. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6769.28s)]
*  I don't even know. I've never smoked weed or anything else. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6771.28s)]
*  I've done them. They're all right. [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6773.28s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I didn't do them because I probably would have fucking loved them. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6775.28s)]
*  Oh, yeah, dude. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6778.28s)]
*  You know, I don't know, but you know, you don't want to undercut each other in this industry [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6780.28s)]
*  where it's a race to the bottom. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6784.28s)]
*  So there are a lot of employers out there that have welcomed us in [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6786.28s)]
*  because of that reason. Like we don't want to sell a gummy, you know, [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6790.28s)]
*  25 cents cheaper than the guy down the street. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6794.28s)]
*  So, you know, we've actually regulated this industry to a certain point. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6797.28s)]
*  But the other thing, too, which is very important in this industry is continuity of employees, right? [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6801.28s)]
*  So if you are providing employees with a union contract, good wages, good benefits, [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6806.28s)]
*  you know, there's not going to be a turnover ratio, right? [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6812.28s)]
*  You know, we first started this organizing campaign. [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6815.28s)]
*  We were seeing, you know, 20, 21-year-old kids that, you know, they weren't stealing a banana. [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6818.28s)]
*  They were sampling the product, right? [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6823.28s)]
*  And they'd get, you know, fired or they'd leave. [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6825.28s)]
*  So, you know, we've actually instilled some stability in this industry [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6827.28s)]
*  just because they know there's an opportunity. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6832.28s)]
*  And they're organized as a contract and, you know, there's a future. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6834.28s)]
*  Yeah, I think then you feel like you're part of something, you know, [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6839.28s)]
*  which is the same thing like in it, which goes back to our conversation about America. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6841.28s)]
*  It's just like feeling like you're a part of something, feeling like, you know, [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6845.28s)]
*  I think it used to feel like your country was unionized, you know? [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6849.28s)]
*  It definitely felt like that when I was a kid. [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6852.28s)]
*  And we haven't catered to that, you know, and our leaders haven't catered to that [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6854.28s)]
*  and our decision makers haven't catered to that. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6858.28s)]
*  One last question. [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6861.28s)]
*  Wait, so do the union also work with the employer to do certain things? [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6863.28s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, there's times where we have to work with each other on, you know, [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6869.28s)]
*  legislation that benefits, you know, both our members in the company. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6873.28s)]
*  There's a lot of common fights that we have to work together on. [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6878.28s)]
*  It's not always a line drawn in the sand. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6883.28s)]
*  And the good thing is it's like, you know, a lot of political issues we have coming up, [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6887.28s)]
*  like, you know, certain issues with Reauthorization Act [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6893.28s)]
*  and, you know, a lot of federal legislation will work with a lot of our larger employers, [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6896.28s)]
*  especially if it's more beneficial for our members. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6902.28s)]
*  So yeah, we do work. We do work a lot with employers. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6905.28s)]
*  Some employers, you know, you'll never be able to work with. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6908.28s)]
*  They just, you know, they just dig in and they want to fight all the time. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6911.28s)]
*  But, you know, we're ready for it either way, but we'll work with anybody. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6914.28s)]
*  Do you think you'll be able to unionize Amazon workers? [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6918.28s)]
*  Oh, without a doubt, we're going to be able to organize them. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6921.28s)]
*  Hell yeah. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6923.28s)]
*  Without a doubt. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6924.28s)]
*  It's going to be, you know, it's going to be a battle. [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6925.28s)]
*  It's going to be a fight. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6927.28s)]
*  But that's where, you know, we're going to call on, you know, the Dems and the Republicans [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6928.28s)]
*  and everybody involved that say they are passionate and supportive of these workers. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6933.28s)]
*  We're going to call them out. [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6939.28s)]
*  We're going to expose them and we're going to put them to the test. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6941.28s)]
*  And that's what needs to happen. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6944.28s)]
*  We're going to be their conscience. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6946.28s)]
*  I want to represent your mother. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6948.28s)]
*  Yeah. Absolutely. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6950.28s)]
*  I appreciate it. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6951.28s)]
*  I think that'd be awesome. She likes to work hard. [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6953.28s)]
*  She likes to work hard. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6955.28s)]
*  That's one thing my mom's always been is a worker. [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6956.28s)]
*  She likes to work, you know, it's probably her favorite thing to do. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6958.28s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6961.28s)]
*  So what did you get your work ethic from? [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6962.28s)]
*  Probably from her, I guess, you know, it's funny. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6964.28s)]
*  It's like, yeah, there's so many things that, but I do, I do thank her for that. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6968.28s)]
*  Actually, a lot of times it was like she was always working, but I'm yeah, I do have a strong work ethic because of her. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6972.28s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's a well, you're a product of your environment. [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6980.28s)]
*  Yeah. If you're if your parents sat on the couch, smoke butts and drink beers, chances are that's probably what you're going to do. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6983.28s)]
*  Yeah. You know, I had the ability growing up where I grew up. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6988.28s)]
*  My father worked two or three jobs and hustled his whole life. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6991.28s)]
*  My mother, the same thing. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6995.28s)]
*  So, you know, we try and still that work ethic and my two kids and my nephews as well, you know, which is important. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=6996.28s)]
*  And that's I think we've got to get back to basics in this country. [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7004.28s)]
*  And, you know, I think we have the ability to do it over the next several years. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7007.28s)]
*  Well, and a worker should be able to know if they're going to lock in with a company and like, I'm going to be here that I'm going to know that when I get home from work every day, I'm not going to also wonder, do I need to go back out to another job to pay for insurance this month for my wife and for my children? [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7012.28s)]
*  And and then they're not home to be home with their children. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7026.28s)]
*  And so then the children grew up without their parents around. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7029.28s)]
*  And so then they run into all types of things. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7032.28s)]
*  So then they're in therapy and they're out using drugs or they don't and there's no sense of a family. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7034.28s)]
*  And it just everything starts to dissolve, you know, and it's just and it definitely is there's a part of it is greed at the top. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7040.28s)]
*  And a part of it is that in a first world country like this in a country that has the highest GDP in the world, you would think that we would also want the workers to be happy. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7049.28s)]
*  And worrying about what's next always isn't that you can't stress alone, you know, can cause so much damage to someone. [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7062.28s)]
*  Think about think about your personal life, my personal life. [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7071.28s)]
*  When you're happy in your personal life, you're productive. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7074.28s)]
*  Yeah. Right. [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7077.28s)]
*  You're driven. Same should hold true with people that go to work every single day. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7078.28s)]
*  The employer should realize that if you have a happy employee that you embrace and you respect, they're going to work that much harder for you. [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7083.28s)]
*  Right. And you reward more importantly, reward, I think, for sure. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7093.28s)]
*  It's you know, it's tough to be the certain type of employer to everybody, but that they should be rewarded for sure. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7097.28s)]
*  There's no doubt, you know, I mean, you talk about therapy when you're a kid. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7104.28s)]
*  I just look back at my therapy was a wooden spoon over the head if we acted up, you know. [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7108.28s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Oh, my mother. [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7113.28s)]
*  That was a good old days, wasn't it? [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7114.28s)]
*  Oh, dude, my mother would hit us like Teddy Bruce. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7116.28s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7119.28s)]
*  She would just fucking. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7120.28s)]
*  My mother had more hits on us than Justin Bieber. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7121.28s)]
*  Oh, my mother would put on a Pedroia jersey and just fucking tear into us, dude. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7124.28s)]
*  Just hitting triples right off of my brother. [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7129.28s)]
*  Oh, that's good stuff. [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7131.28s)]
*  Yeah. Did you laugh when your brother was getting beat? [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7132.28s)]
*  Every now and then I chimed in, dude. [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7134.28s)]
*  I shatter a wooden chair over that frickin' mixed breed. [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7136.28s)]
*  Remember how, like growing up, I don't know how you grew up in your house, but we'd be eating dinner. [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7139.28s)]
*  My father would work two or three jobs and you'd be sitting there eating dinner. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7146.28s)]
*  We grew up in a pretty modest house. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7150.28s)]
*  Very simple. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7152.28s)]
*  And God forbid, you know, you couldn't poke the bear. [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7154.28s)]
*  God forbid someone spilled something at the table. [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7158.28s)]
*  Be Jesus fucking Christ. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7160.28s)]
*  And you'd start, you'd be firing, your fork would have sparks on it because you want to get out of that table because you don't want to feel the wrath. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7163.28s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7170.28s)]
*  It was awful. [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7171.28s)]
*  But those are the best times. [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7172.28s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7174.28s)]
*  It was so much fun. [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7175.28s)]
*  And part of what you're talking about is a family being able to sit and have dinner together. [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7176.28s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7179.28s)]
*  And part of that was because, like, yeah, because people are being compensated fairly and a mom was able to be at home sometimes and sometimes they weren't. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7180.28s)]
*  But yeah, and now we've gotten to this point where it's like both both parents have to work and nobody and people aren't even building a family unit anymore. [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7188.28s)]
*  And it's and I mean that in a negative way. [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7196.28s)]
*  Some people still are. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7199.28s)]
*  But people should be able to afford to do that in a country that brings in this much that produces this much. [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7200.28s)]
*  It's it's got to start to change. [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7208.28s)]
*  There should be a work family balance. [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7210.28s)]
*  And look, I'm guilty as charged. [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7212.28s)]
*  I went out to work and I wanted to work 80, 90 hours a week. [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7213.28s)]
*  I still do. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7216.28s)]
*  And I always did it with the objective of taking care of my family, taking care of my kids. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7217.28s)]
*  And thankfully, my kids didn't end up fucked up over. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7222.28s)]
*  Well, I mean, you know, maybe not completely. [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7225.28s)]
*  But Sean looks like he's. [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7228.28s)]
*  Sean's all right. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7229.28s)]
*  Sean's good. [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7230.28s)]
*  We'll see. [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7231.28s)]
*  Yeah, we'll see. [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7232.28s)]
*  Jerry's still out. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7233.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7234.28s)]
*  But no, you went to work to provide for your family. [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7235.28s)]
*  And now it's like, you know, you made that choice. [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7237.28s)]
*  Now you don't have a choice, you know, because it's just so hard to make it. [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7240.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7244.28s)]
*  Yeah, we can definitely do better. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7245.28s)]
*  And it starts with the individual people. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqywMRXq4&t=7246.28s)]
