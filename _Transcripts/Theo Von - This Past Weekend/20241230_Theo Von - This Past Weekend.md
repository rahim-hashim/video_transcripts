*  That kind of works a little yeah, I think that's honestly you should keep the first one [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN5-_dRuXpE&t=3059.64s)]
*  But if i've done one thing well [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN5-_dRuXpE&t=3065.8s)]
*  it's what I call [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN5-_dRuXpE&t=3067.88s)]
*  failure and that is [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN5-_dRuXpE&t=3069.7200000000003s)]
*  I ran for sophomore junior and senior class presidents [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN5-_dRuXpE&t=3072.12s)]
*  I lost three times and based on my track record [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN5-_dRuXpE&t=3075.48s)]
*  I decided to run for student body president where I went on to wait for it lose [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN5-_dRuXpE&t=3078.04s)]
*  I've started nine businesses [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN5-_dRuXpE&t=3082.9199999999996s)]
*  Seven have failed [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN5-_dRuXpE&t=3085.0s)]
*  I can't tell you how many women in whole foods and other places and other retail establishments. I've been rejected by yeah [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN5-_dRuXpE&t=3086.6s)]
*  But the reason I get to live the life I lead [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN5-_dRuXpE&t=3092.3599999999997s)]
*  The reason i'm with a very high character attractive person [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN5-_dRuXpE&t=3095.48s)]
*  Is because I have always been able to endure endure rejection [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN5-_dRuXpE&t=3099.16s)]
*  And that is the key that is the skill because one of the great things about america is we don't embrace failure [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN5-_dRuXpE&t=3103.32s)]
*  That's bullshit, but we tolerate it [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN5-_dRuXpE&t=3107.88s)]
*  If your business fails, but you're a good person usually your investors will back you again [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN5-_dRuXpE&t=3110.12s)]
*  And if you approach a woman and express interest and she's not interested [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN5-_dRuXpE&t=3114.52s)]
*  You're both going to be fine [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN5-_dRuXpE&t=3118.68s)]
*  Yeah, and show me a guy show me a guy [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN5-_dRuXpE&t=3120.36s)]
*  You know, we all know that guy you think okay. He's a nice guy [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN5-_dRuXpE&t=3123.88s)]
*  He's modestly successful. He's not that attractive and he's with just such a high quality woman [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN5-_dRuXpE&t=3127.16s)]
*  That guy is not afraid of rejection [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN5-_dRuXpE&t=3134.04s)]
*  That guy cycled through nine women who said get the fuck away from me [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN5-_dRuXpE&t=3136.44s)]
*  Before he found that one woman who gave him a chance to be funny kind [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN5-_dRuXpE&t=3140.6s)]
*  She was drawn to a smell. She liked the way he treated his parents [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN5-_dRuXpE&t=3145.72s)]
*  The key to success in america [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN5-_dRuXpE&t=3149.64s)]
*  Is what winston churchill said and that is the willingness to fail or your ability to fail and not lose your sense of enthusiasm [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN5-_dRuXpE&t=3152.04s)]
*  There was a study done in australia [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN5-_dRuXpE&t=3159.64s)]
*  At least I used to work in palliative care as a doctor looking after dying people [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN5-_dRuXpE&t=3161.64s)]
*  You know what the top regret of dying people was that they didn't have the courage to be themselves [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN5-_dRuXpE&t=3166.6s)]
*  And and and the third top regret was [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN5-_dRuXpE&t=3172.2799999999997s)]
*  That they didn't have the courage to express their emotions. They pretended to be [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN5-_dRuXpE&t=3175.24s)]
*  Happy when they were not and so on so the question for [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN5-_dRuXpE&t=3179.96s)]
*  The rest of us is do we want to wait? [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN5-_dRuXpE&t=3184.2799999999997s)]
*  Till some terminal illness wakes us up or should we just confront the fact that in so many ways [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN5-_dRuXpE&t=3187.24s)]
*  We're afraid to be authentic because we're so afraid of being rejected. You've really taken over america [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN5-_dRuXpE&t=3193.0s)]
