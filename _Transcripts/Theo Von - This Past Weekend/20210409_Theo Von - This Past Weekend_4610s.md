*  But you know, so you didn't have that back in the day but now you buy anything you have it [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=1435.8799999999999s)]
*  And so it's a little alarming to me in the sense of an 18 year old [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=1443.3999999999999s)]
*  Gets on to the sex world and selling sexuality selling that kind of stuff. It's not wrong [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=1447.56s)]
*  And in everybody's opinion is is valid [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=1453.56s)]
*  But what worries me is then [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=1457.9599999999998s)]
*  Whoever buys it [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=1461.32s)]
*  Is going to be getting baited throughout the rest of their life [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=1463.8s)]
*  With that dirty bait [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=1467.6399999999999s)]
*  That young bait [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=1469.9599999999998s)]
*  That cusp bait [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=1472.6799999999998s)]
*  That line between air and water [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=1475.0800000000002s)]
*  Where you breathe in and you [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=1480.6000000000001s)]
*  And that's what scares me is that you can't just make a purchase one day or make a [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=1488.76s)]
*  I don't even want to fuck. I might call it a mistake [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=1493.72s)]
*  If you buy and looks at looks at a children at an 18 year old that's a mistake [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=1497.72s)]
*  But it's a legal man. I mean look it's in your loins. I feel it but at my age. It's a little risque [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=1505.24s)]
*  But [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=1514.8400000000001s)]
*  What I worry about then is the algorithms the the ability of apps to then haunt you to chase you [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=1515.88s)]
*  Say hey [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=1524.04s)]
*  About this young titty, you know [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=1526.44s)]
*  Oh, we got a girl. She was a senior volleyball captain [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=1529.5600000000002s)]
*  And she bought them tits now she's 18, you know, it's like that kind of stuff because the algorithm is going to haunt you now [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=1533.4s)]
*  Whereas back in the day it was a little different you buy something at a bakery that everything stopped at the counter [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=1543.0s)]
*  And the only person that knew your secret was thick tiff back there [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=1549.8799999999999s)]
*  Or fat allen or whoever, you know, no no shame bro. No shame. No shame [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=1555.96s)]
*  So [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=1561.08s)]
*  Anyway, I don't know exactly what i'm saying [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=1563.8799999999999s)]
*  But that's the kind of stuff that worries me is the is the ability of these apps to keep tabs and the ability of that [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=1565.7199999999998s)]
*  Because how many times before they keep haunting somebody [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=1573.56s)]
*  With an 18 year old 18 year old and then you're just making a pervert [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=1578.6s)]

*  But anyway, that's what's going on, man. Um [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=1593.34s)]

*  You know [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=1868.22s)]
*  There's just [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=1870.7s)]
*  Ha [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=1872.7s)]
*  There's just so many you know [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=1874.62s)]
*  You need towels you need soaps you need silverware [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=1878.22s)]
*  I got plastic plates [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=1882.1399999999999s)]
*  And unfortunately, I got three things of plastic plates because the picture on the website looked like bowls [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=1884.3s)]
*  But it was plates and I think it said bowls [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=1890.54s)]
*  I think they spelled plates with a b o w l e s [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=1893.58s)]
*  So i'll fold the freaking plate in like a little bowl and get my cereal in the morning [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=1897.74s)]
*  And then they got some red robins doing a nest outside with eggs in it [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=1902.8600000000001s)]
*  And so I don't want to go out there and cause any harm. I don't want to affect mother nature [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=1908.14s)]
*  I got enough shit on my fucking docket at the moment. So [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=1911.9s)]
*  So that's where I am with that. Um [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=1916.22s)]
*  What else [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=1920.22s)]
*  Had some people come move a refrigerator in and they broke one of the front steps [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=1922.06s)]
*  Had the limb fall in the backyard [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=1927.02s)]
*  Um [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=1929.66s)]
*  You know, so just regular life man regular life shit don't have a hamper yet, so it's just [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=1932.54s)]
*  You know when you don't have a hamper [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=1939.82s)]
*  Everywhere is a hamper [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=1942.06s)]
*  You know the drill but boy [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=1944.06s)]
*  Everywhere is a hamper [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=1946.3s)]
*  So i'm just doing that i'm living that life right now [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=1948.7s)]
*  And I think some of it feels a little sad [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=1955.82s)]
*  You know, it's a little sad to be uh [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=1959.66s)]
*  Not sad, but it's like you know, it makes you it's one of those moments where you get in a new place and you're like, okay [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=1963.5s)]
*  It's it's almost like walking up a staircase not really up but even sideways on a on a platform or something you [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=1975.42s)]
*  And you the the view is different [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=1981.98s)]

*  It's just you start thinking about a lot of stuff like that [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2017.26s)]
*  um [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2020.38s)]
*  Adulthood, you know, it's a little scary [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2022.14s)]
*  a little scary [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2025.1000000000001s)]
*  But it's good. It's just a little scary [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2026.54s)]
*  Let's get the news one more time man [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2029.82s)]
*  An article [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2033.18s)]
*  justice [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2035.42s)]
*  Clarence thomas and I didn't I didn't even know his first name was justice, but [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2037.5s)]
*  That's pretty dope [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2041.82s)]
*  Justice clarence thomas said on monday that congress should suggest whether laws should be updated to regulate social media platforms [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2043.8999999999999s)]
*  He claims social media platforms have come to have unbridled control over unprecedented amounts of speech [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2053.18s)]
*  Suggested the platform should be used as common carriers such as trains and telephone companies [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2060.46s)]
*  Both having large amounts of government regulations [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2065.9s)]
*  Um [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2069.1s)]
*  You know I think about this a lot because it does seem to me that [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2072.06s)]
*  What used to be people just talking now the the place where you talk is now social media that has become the [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2080.4599999999996s)]
*  The communication environment [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2090.22s)]
*  And I guess people could debate and say well now you could just talk to your neighbors or talk to some but [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2092.8599999999997s)]
*  You can but that's not really what goes on anymore [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2099.8199999999997s)]
*  You know most talking or communicating is done now online whereas it used to be [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2104.7799999999997s)]
*  um [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2110.62s)]
*  You had to go and [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2112.2999999999997s)]
*  See something live. There's now so much [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2115.18s)]
*  more accessibility to [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2117.8999999999996s)]
*  Communication online most accessibility to communication is online [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2119.9s)]
*  Um [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2125.58s)]
*  And I I guess I feel like people should be able to say whatever they want [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2129.26s)]
*  Because it's almost like [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2139.02s)]
*  The companies have become like the microphone so everybody has a microphone now and the companies have owned the microphone [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2142.54s)]
*  Where they can't own your actual voice, but they own [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2149.26s)]
*  The thing your voice goes through to reach others, you know that spigot [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2153.02s)]
*  And [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2159.7400000000002s)]
*  And yeah, it's I feel like it should be regulated somehow [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2162.1400000000003s)]
*  you hate to have the government involved, but [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2166.2200000000003s)]
*  at the same time because you want like free speech, but [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2169.34s)]
*  If the way we speak is now goes through a filter [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2173.5s)]
*  And that filter has judgment or jurisdiction over what is okay to say [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2176.86s)]
*  Then that seems very dangerous [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2185.26s)]
*  Because now speech doesn't feel free it feels very specific [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2193.5s)]
*  Like you're allowed to say things but not these things [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2198.94s)]
*  And i'd love to know what some of you guys think on that, you know [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2206.78s)]
*  If you could hit the hotline nine eight five six six four nine five zero three [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2210.06s)]
*  Yeah, you know I I just [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2217.5s)]
*  Because I feel like a lot of things. Yeah, they're just not allowed to be shared and [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2220.38s)]
*  Not allowed to be said online things get labeled [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2224.46s)]
*  Things get labeled and then taken down [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2229.9s)]
*  Uh [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2232.46s)]
*  So that just feels alarming at least let people decide [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2234.06s)]
*  what they want to [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2238.38s)]
*  hear or believe [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2240.38s)]
*  But everyone should have the ability to share. I feel like [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2242.3s)]
*  I feel like and i'm open to uh, to hear different people's thoughts on that [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2246.62s)]
*  Because maybe also it's it's just our responsibility [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2253.98s)]
*  To be like, oh well this platform isn't [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2258.14s)]
*  Uh doesn't allow everything to be shared and I think most people know that [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2260.54s)]
*  but [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2266.7799999999997s)]
*  I don't know just a lot there man. There's a lot in that little cauldron [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2269.18s)]
*  So if you want to stir that thing hit the hotline nine eight five six six four nine five zero three [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2273.3399999999997s)]

*  Um [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2450.64s)]
*  But yeah, it's tough because you don't want to hold somebody back from an opportunity but at the same time you want to hold somebody [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2453.28s)]
*  And that's a real tricky biscuit man, that's Aaron water man, that's Aaron water [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2464.0s)]
*  Um [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2472.64s)]
*  Let's see you right here Aaron rogers speaking of air, uh, Aaron rogers on jeopardy [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2475.44s)]
*  A question came in on Aaron rogers. Somebody asked him. This was interesting [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2481.2799999999997s)]
*  Over to our two-day champion on the end [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2486.72s)]
*  Scott did you come up with the correct response who wanted to kick that field goal? [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2489.3599999999997s)]
*  Oh [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2494.16s)]
*  That is a great question should be should be correct but uh, unfortunately for this uh, this game today [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2501.8399999999997s)]
*  That's incorrect and you're going to lose [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2507.44s)]
*  and a man asked him on their Aaron rogers famously they didn't make the the super bowl because they uh, [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2510.3999999999996s)]
*  Well, who knows if that's why but they they chose to kick a few goals instead of go for it [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2516.0s)]
*  Um, and so a guy asked him that on jeopardy when he was hosting jeopardy [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2521.84s)]
*  Aaron rogers has the most punchable face I think i've ever seen really there's just [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2528.08s)]
*  It's just so punchable. Um [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2536.48s)]
*  But yeah, I think that was great man. I love it when somebody hits somebody with the surprise with that rare element [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2540.1600000000003s)]
*  You know you hit him with that plutonium or that egregium bro [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2546.32s)]
*  When you shock the table bro and hit him with that periodic fucking uniqueness dog, okay [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2550.0s)]
*  So that's a good question who wanted to kick that field goal? Who knows man? [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2555.68s)]
*  Uh [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2560.64s)]
*  What else do we have man? We got [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2562.0s)]
*  A lot of uh calls that came in [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2565.8399999999997s)]
*  Let's do one right here that came in [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2569.52s)]
*  Hey, phil what's going on bro? My name's brad [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2573.12s)]
*  I'm coming to you from gaylord, michigan big bread and that's a rare name, man [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2576.08s)]
*  That's the carbohydrate hitter baby big bread. Let's hear it [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2583.76s)]
*  Um, I just got two questions for you here [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2588.32s)]
*  Uh, the first one is so i'm gonna stop i'm 22 years old and i'm gonna stop smoking weed on monday here [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2592.0s)]
*  Sure, you are bread. Let's hear more bud [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2598.64s)]
*  Um, I know you used to be addicted to them cigarettes [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2600.7999999999997s)]
*  So i'm just curious on what you would do to kind of keep your mind off that and to like not reach for one [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2605.2s)]
*  Oh, yeah [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2612.56s)]
*  Man, I stay away from that weed because that weed is a nice it's like a pillow but you put it's like a [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2614.56s)]
*  It's like putting your head on a pillow, but the pillow's inside your head [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2620.72s)]
*  I think I would probably do some fitness too. I think doing fitness is like it's hard to go for a jog [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2623.3599999999997s)]
*  I feel like and then want to get stoned. I feel like if you activate the other side of you [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2628.8s)]
*  Um [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2636.48s)]
*  That physical side maybe it'll uh [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2639.04s)]
*  It'll just keep your pump up and you'll feel so good off them endorphins. You won't want to get [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2642.2400000000002s)]
*  Um playing it out [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2647.52s)]
*  But those are my thoughts, you know, I don't know you might want to smoke weed forever also [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2650.0800000000004s)]
*  You might want to do it and just not tell your friends you might want to [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2655.44s)]
*  You know, you could try dmt, you know that could help you quit [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2658.8s)]
*  That's what got me to quit cigarettes [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2662.32s)]
*  You know when I still [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2666.32s)]
*  Actually, I don't man I it took the real desire to have that that hit out of me [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2669.44s)]
*  Because that's the thing about smoking weed I want us I want to suck on that thing, bro [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2677.6000000000004s)]
*  I want to suck on that grassy grassy knob daddy, you know what i'm saying that john [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2683.44s)]
*  I want to fucking tickle my lungs with that fucking soft little field stick, baby that john [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2689.44s)]
*  So [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2698.4s)]
*  I wasn't good at them johns man. A lot of brothers are better at smoking weed. I think than whites praise god, man and [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2702.2400000000002s)]
*  You know, I seen a male man the other day smoke or male woman [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2711.36s)]
*  I'm not sure if it was a man or woman [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2714.0s)]
*  And they were urban, you know, and they was smoking a joint [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2716.48s)]
*  And I didn't fucking say nothing, you know what i'm saying, bro like [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2719.6s)]
*  You know what i'm saying you can't you can't say anything anymore so you just [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2724.72s)]
*  Kind of pray for them and just don't use the postal system anymore [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2729.76s)]
*  You know, it's almost getting back to days. You just take a letter to somebody if you need to get it to them [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2733.2s)]
*  But uh [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2739.92s)]
*  But anyway, what else you got bub [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2742.08s)]
*  Also, I got me and four buddies coming to uh, making a road trip down to nashville tennessee [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2744.32s)]
*  And i'm just curious if you have any input on what we should do. We're staying right on broadway there [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2751.04s)]
*  I don't know. We don't know if we should pull up with some cowboy boots and a cowboy hat [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2756.7200000000003s)]
*  I'm just curious if you could tell me how it's looking down there [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2760.7200000000003s)]
*  Well, look, it's open. It's open carry as well. I think it's an open carry state so you could glock up [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2764.0s)]
*  I think they just opened that up and um [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2768.8s)]
*  You know, it's the central east man. So it's all types of people broadway does have a real country vibe to it [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2772.48s)]
*  But there's all types around here [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2778.8s)]
*  There's all types around here and it's um, you know, it's a tourist destination [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2781.76s)]
*  I think find some things to do that are outside of just right in the city [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2789.44s)]
*  I mean unless you guys are just looking to rage [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2792.64s)]
*  If that's the case if y'all just looking to shed some skin, bro [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2795.36s)]
*  And just dick out or whatever they call it, you know [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2799.28s)]
*  or just touch titty or whatever then you'll be fine, but [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2802.8s)]
*  If you want more than that, then you'll probably need to talk to a concierge or look at a um [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2807.52s)]
*  You know like a fan flute or something [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2814.7200000000003s)]
*  And find other stuff to do [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2817.28s)]
*  My my favorite thing to do is just drive out to the countryside, you know, just take a cruise out somewhere, but [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2819.6800000000003s)]
*  That's not always the thing you're looking to do [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2824.7200000000003s)]
*  When you and your buddies are just trying to get bent out [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2827.68s)]
*  you know and try and try to [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2831.04s)]
*  Make sure everybody's straight. That's the thing as you get older and you go get wasted with a bunch of friends. It's really [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2833.04s)]
*  You just got you know, that's how you find that's how you just make sure that everybody's straight in the in the group so [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2839.2799999999997s)]

*  You know [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2878.56s)]
*  There's a lot worse ways to go man [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2882.3199999999997s)]
*  There's a lot worse ways to go than with half a taco in you [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2885.6s)]
*  And these days nobody wants to have any accountability no matter what it is [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2890.56s)]
*  You know, everyone everybody wants to hashtag taco Tuesday and you know, nom nom nom nom [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2896.16s)]
*  But they came back it up in the streets they get out there [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2903.04s)]

*  Unless they use that t-shirt cannon and shot it down your boy's gullet [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=2921.76s)]

*  Beautiful man this fella for the wildcats [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=3074.48s)]
*  And he has down syndrome and he played for the wildcats and uh, and they let him run in for the score [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=3077.04s)]
*  You know and that kind of stuff is sweet man is beautiful to see it's beautiful to see the little fella [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=3084.56s)]
*  Getting out there [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=3090.2400000000002s)]
*  Getting into the end zone feeling that just that fire, you know, because so many people don't get to feel like camaraderie [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=3092.2400000000002s)]
*  I do think though [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=3099.68s)]
*  That somebody towards the end of the thing should have lit him up a little bit [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=3102.48s)]
*  You know have a brother at least a mixed dude [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=3106.48s)]
*  Fly in and just right as he crosses the goal line crack him a little just to really [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=3110.3999999999996s)]
*  Because that's how you learn man going through the fire [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=3120.16s)]
*  You could let anybody just run across the track [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=3127.52s)]
*  You get a good feeling i'm sure it's uplifting [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=3130.08s)]
*  But knowing that you got laid down by a mixed dude right at the end [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=3134.64s)]
*  I think that that makes it even doper if he shows it to his friends or [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=3142.24s)]
*  When he watches it back, you know [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=3147.84s)]
*  It gives it that vitro [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=3151.12s)]
*  So, I know the fella's already got that ds on him and I wish say, you know [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=3154.4s)]
*  You know, I feel like they just should have [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=3157.76s)]
*  Had a brother crack him down at the end or [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=3161.1200000000003s)]
*  Just somebody and not like hurt him you're not trying to hurt the guy, you know, he's already got his thing going on but [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=3165.0400000000004s)]

*  You just don't care about things as much [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=3470.56s)]
*  You see a squirrel get shot or something [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=3473.8399999999997s)]
*  You feel bad, but you don't feel bad. You just know you feel bad [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=3477.6s)]
*  You feel sad [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=3483.2000000000003s)]

*  So it kind of you know, like when you went bowling as a child [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=3497.52s)]
*  And they had them bumper bowlings on it's like that [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=3502.0800000000004s)]
*  But for feelings just puts the bumpers on [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=3507.44s)]
*  And sometimes I want the bumpers off. I want the full throttle. I want that dirty monti, you know [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=3513.28s)]
*  I want that nasty nasty. I want all the feelings [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=3520.0s)]
*  So that's the trade-off [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=3525.28s)]
*  You don't get the highs and you don't get the lows you get a whole lot of harsh mediums [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=3527.76s)]
*  Good and bad [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=3535.28s)]
*  So sometimes I wish I could quit and now I can't quit [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=3538.7200000000003s)]
*  I quit for a few days and I spiral a little [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=3542.88s)]
*  And I don't even know if it's placebo or if it's real [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=3546.48s)]
*  But I quit for a few days and I then I get real scared one bad thing happens and I think you know [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=3550.7200000000003s)]
*  I start feeling some type of way and [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=3555.76s)]
*  Then I feel like everything's going to be bad and I have to get right back on it [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=3558.8s)]
*  And it's crazy to me that [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=3564.4s)]
*  You know something that I went in for 20 years ago [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=3566.96s)]
*  They gave me this pill and i'm still taking it that's that's wild [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=3569.76s)]
*  It feels not right like if you broke your arm and they put a cast on it 20 years ago if you still had the cast on [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=3575.6800000000003s)]
*  It seems like they'd have some way to get you off the cast [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=3584.96s)]
*  And that's the thing about it it's more like getting I don't know it's like an eternal thing [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=3590.1600000000003s)]
*  But don't feel bad about it a lot of people are on it [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=3595.76s)]
*  I would just kind of monitor how you are on it [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=3600.0800000000004s)]
*  And then make an educated guess for yourself [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXZDBBfu8UI&t=3603.44s)]
