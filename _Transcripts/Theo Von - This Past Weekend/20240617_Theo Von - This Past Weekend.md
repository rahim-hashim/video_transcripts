Video Description: $crim and Ruby Da Cherry, a.k.a, $uicideboy$ are a rap duo (and cousins) from New Orleans, Louisiana. Their new album, “New World Depression” is streaming now on all platforms, and you can catch them on tour later this summer. 

$uicideboy$ join Theo in New Orleans for a highly requested episode of This Past Weekend, chatting about their roots in the Gulf Coast, the long, dark history that lead to the formation of $B, how they were able to survive and make music during the most chaotic times in their lives, getting clean and evolving as artists, how they cultivated such a close-knit fanbase, the time $crim thought Southwest Airlines was trying to kill him, and much more.

*  Yeah [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=713.2s)]
*  for me I grew up on like [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=714.32s)]
*  36 have that was that was my biggest influence and [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=716.92s)]
*  Yeah, yeah like old Memphis music from like the 90s and my uncle put me on that when I was like eight years old [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=721.52s)]
*  And I just got obsessed [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=727.88s)]
*  But other than that I came from more of like a trap [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=730.32s)]
*  Music background like trap house dope deal [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=734.48s)]

*  Mm-hmm and like hip-hop I was on the hip-hop tip. Yeah, I was like an old head at like 25 [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=742.36s)]
*  Like this isn't philosophical enough for me [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=750.64s)]
*  Yeah, that's where we differ also [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=753.72s)]
*  He made me realize that I was I was taking myself way too seriously as far as like my taste in music goes [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=756.08s)]
*  Yeah [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=761.12s)]
*  and I think a lot of people from New Orleans have like this elitist taste in music because you know the city's pretty like [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=761.56s)]

*  So I think growing up here you kind of like at least I did develop this elite taste [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=770.28s)]
*  And he's the one that kind of knocked me down a couple pegs [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=774.8s)]
*  And I realized oh some music is just fun. Yeah, it doesn't have to be so serious like with a message and shit [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=777.36s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, that's the vibe I get from like and even getting a go to uh go to one of y'all shows like just like there's this [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=782.72s)]

*  Own skin I can relate to that very well myself [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=813.92s)]
*  So I think we provide a place for these kids to feel like they're surrounded by their people [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=817.36s)]
*  Yeah, they come and they like unity. Yeah, and that's like this emotional like [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=822.52s)]

*  It's just so funny that now we're still doing the same [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=1466.02s)]
*  Yeah, you know, yeah, so he just kind of evolved from there and then you start putting on shows locally [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=1468.8600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, we would use we would book shows on like the North Shore and Baton Rouge or whatever because I may be real with you [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=1473.5s)]

*  So we knew we didn't expect anybody to come and we would use those live shows as practice [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=1483.16s)]
*  Yeah [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=1488.1200000000001s)]

*  T-shirts like blanks and then we just printed all our own t-shirts [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=1512.4s)]
*  Yeah, we would literally text people like when I buy one and then Scott would like drive it to them and deliver [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=1515.6200000000001s)]

*  You want everything to be perfect and learning to let other people help you? [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=1630.96s)]
*  And then your ego can build without you even noticing. Oh, yeah, you think like oh, I'm just proud of myself [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=1635.36s)]

*  Because I just I didn't know how to live in this world didn't want to live in this world at all [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=1674.8400000000001s)]

*  What made you in so much pain you think like what was he what was the tough part for you you think? [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=1691.4s)]

*  Everybody was doing the best they could yeah, but what they knew how to do [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=1738.0s)]
*  It was still tough, you know, it was it was some tough shit to grow up in you know, so [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=1743.0s)]
*  That didn't help I tell you the biggest thing and I'll shut up that way [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=1748.04s)]
*  I don't get too overwinded with this because I have a tendency to do that [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=1751.32s)]
*  But I always start like this thing like okay, the drugs are not working anymore. They're not [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=1754.68s)]
*  Doing it for me. But this thing this thing's gonna do it for me [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=1760.88s)]
*  Once we get to that place, whatever that place is in my head whenever I get that thing [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=1765.0s)]
*  That's gonna do it for me and then I got really suicidal when we got there [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=1771.24s)]
*  Whatever they're wherever there is and nothing changed and you know, I was like, I'm gonna do it for me [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=1777.64s)]

*  The answer for me [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=1799.16s)]
*  Has been getting involved in the 12-step [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=1801.3200000000002s)]

*  It was that video and then from there, you know, I watched that video and you inspired me bro [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2039.92s)]
*  And you gave me hope and then that's when I did a deep dive on you started watching all like your greatest hits and highlights [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2046.3000000000002s)]
*  And shit laughing my ass off, but that's funny [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2052.6800000000003s)]
*  That's how I came to know you but yeah before we even knew each other bro [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2054.76s)]
*  You you you gave me a little bump and I needed it too with that video. Okay, man [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2057.96s)]
*  Thanks, bro. Yeah, it's crazy kind of I think the connection that people get going through like if they're using or if they're recovering [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2062.88s)]
*  That's like yeah on both sides of that it feels it seems like there's probably a lot of connection [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2070.1200000000003s)]
*  You guys could probably speak to that, huh? You think what you mean like even on the using side [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2074.36s)]
*  There's like a level of connection that that keeps people. Oh, yeah. Yeah [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2078.78s)]
*  I mean that'll keep you in in the act of addiction by you know, you kind of almost [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2082.72s)]
*  When I was buying pills and shit and snorting Roxy's I never wanted to do them alone [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2088.24s)]
*  This I would share with everybody and I was making money so I could buy a bunch and I would share with [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2092.44s)]
*  People that were my friends that didn't make as much money and they were glad happy to get free pills [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2097.68s)]
*  And yeah, I could like be in my dark shit, but not alone. I think a lot of addicts are chasing loneliness. They're chasing [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2101.44s)]
*  They're having trouble with self-acceptance and I think finding your little group of like similar drugs that you want to do together [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2109.84s)]
*  It definitely makes you feel like you're safe and at home [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2116.4s)]
*  Yeah [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2118.44s)]
*  and then the exact opposite happens when you get off of them to you find your people that want to stay away from that shit and [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2118.96s)]
*  It kind of strengthens your your little community that you're in. Yeah. Yeah [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2123.88s)]
*  What were some of the hot like would have been some of the highlights? I mean because you guys have a success that I think [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2128.68s)]
*  Like a lot of people don't really know it in a lot of ways a lot of people do but y'all aren't a mainstream thing [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2134.04s)]
*  Yeah, it's like is that offensive to say these doesn't [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2140.68s)]
*  Kind of take offense to the opposite that people do consider us mainstream [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2144.24s)]
*  I don't think we are we are and maybe how popular we are or how many people listen to us [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2147.88s)]
*  But you know, you're not gonna see like the gatekeep, you know what I'm saying? Yeah, especially our fan base [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2152.4s)]
*  Yeah, they like gatekeep. What does that mean when people say gatekeep? They feel like it's their thing [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2156.7599999999998s)]
*  You have to deserve to be our fan [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2160.64s)]
*  Yeah, it feels like that though [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2162.68s)]
*  You know every every fan that we meet whether it's like we're just out and about and we run into somebody that recognizes us [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2164.2s)]
*  Ask him and I bet you go back me up ten times out of ten [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2169.72s)]

*  Yeah [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2265.04s)]
*  If these people are paying to come watch me perform then the last thing I want to do is just sit there [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2265.84s)]

*  The first few shows we do it's it's kind of like forget [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2294.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, say we'll forget certain lyrics were like fuck dude. We've done this for ten years [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2298.12s)]
*  How are we forgetting this shit you have to get back in the groove? Yeah, you got to get back in the groove man [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2302.0s)]
*  Yeah, um, so you guys now there's a new album coming out [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2305.6s)]
*  What is it like to like evolve like does it is it scary to evolve? I think about it even like in comedy and stuff [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2309.3199999999997s)]
*  I'm like what the heck like [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2316.2799999999997s)]
*  you know some of your like question that listen to you they [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2318.3999999999996s)]
*  They listen to you at a certain age, but they're getting older too. Some of them are all different ages [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2322.76s)]
*  So how do you try and apply to everybody? [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2327.5600000000004s)]
*  I'm really glad you asked that's a great question. And how do you apply try to also apply to yourself at the same time? [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2330.92s)]
*  So we might have two different I think it'll be well at first [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2337.0800000000004s)]
*  I think at first we were scared to kind of change the sound up because the formula was working [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2340.84s)]
*  Yeah [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2345.82s)]
*  and we were worried about like [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2346.0s)]
*  Introducing new stuff because what if they don't like it and this and that and the more successful you get is like the scarier it [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2347.7999999999997s)]
*  Gets because you think yes one wrong fucking move and it all crumbles, which isn't true [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2353.12s)]
*  but we started experimenting doing some like singing stuff or whatever and [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2357.3199999999997s)]
*  People seemed to fuck with it [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2361.9599999999996s)]
*  And then we got to a point to where we don't we didn't really care if they didn't like it or not [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2363.2799999999997s)]
*  Scott and I have been making this music for so long now that if we want to try something [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2367.3999999999996s)]
*  Experimental or new I think we deserve to at this point [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2371.3999999999996s)]
*  So it can be a scary thing but I think you know, don't fear it and just just do it and see what happens [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2375.16s)]
*  Yeah, I think I agree a hundred percent on everything you said from on a more [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2380.3599999999997s)]
*  I don't know if you went through this too, but for me on a more personal level when I got sober [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2386.04s)]
*  It was like I had a like I was so scared because I thought my drug use fueled all my creativity [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2391.48s)]
*  Yeah, that was definitely a thought for sure [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2398.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, and so like for me I once I finally did start getting back into it it was literally like [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2399.88s)]
*  Learning how to walk all over again. It is really and the sound did kind of change as a result of that beat wise [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2407.28s)]
*  Production wise more like yes less [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2416.04s)]
*  Scary and yes, yes [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2419.56s)]
*  So I think the evolution of our music has matched exactly [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2421.56s)]
*  Of us, yeah, that's a great that's a great point that that's how I look at it [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2427.8s)]
*  What was it like like if you're like on pills and you're deep out on pills? [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2432.88s)]
*  I never really got that out on you know, if you're like [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2436.6800000000003s)]

*  Everybody wants to be a chef in this [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2461.96s)]

*  But um, what was it like making music when you're under that influence is it is it even possible to make music when you're like [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2474.44s)]

*  Is it just possible to just like listen back or is it do you feel any creative? [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2485.92s)]
*  Was there any creativity from that actual high of that? [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2491.16s)]
*  I don't know if we work differently because I know sometimes you would wait until after we were done [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2494.48s)]

*  I was tired of explaining that like this insane theory wasn't actually happening. I would one time [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2617.0s)]

*  Speak on the other side of things [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2732.74s)]
*  I'm thinking what is coming out of his mouth is it real or not come to find out the story of his brother stealing a [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2734.5s)]

*  I still refuse to believe that the board of Southwest is meeting to discuss his assassination [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2750.7799999999997s)]
*  But I had my brother and my family but I had fucking time, bro. I was very convincing [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2755.7799999999997s)]
*  I had fans tweeting at Southwest Airlines on Twitter [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2761.66s)]
*  That's crazy, but that was toward the end that was like when I was really spiraling [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2769.2999999999997s)]
*  Fuck dude [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2775.22s)]
*  It's interesting though that you guys were at least had a close enough connection because a lot of bands fall apart from that kind [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2777.06s)]
*  Of stuff a lot of our groups a lot of teams fall apart everything falls away. I'm glad you know that but we're family [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2782.66s)]
*  But for you to go there and want to actually just to think let me see what's really going on [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2788.9s)]
*  We've never even hit each other like we've gotten in each other's faces [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2793.22s)]
*  Ready to fucking beat the shit out of each other and we've both been able like you're my cousin and I don't want to do that [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2796.3s)]
*  I don't want to hit you. Yeah, I fucking hate you right now, but I'm not gonna touch you like and it's gone both ways [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2801.78s)]
*  I'm not gonna say that the family thing which obviously doesn't apply to everybody [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2807.02s)]
*  But we've been able to look at the fact they were cousins and the fact that we provide for our families [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2810.42s)]
*  Which is a shared family as a reason to never give up on each other [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2814.58s)]
*  Yeah, if this was just one of my friends, I don't think it would have been the same. No, like no [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2818.42s)]
*  No way, that's that's good that you brought that up because a lot of a lot of groups just don't make it in general [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2823.34s)]
*  Mm-hmm and doing business with family is usually not a smart way to go [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2829.3s)]
*  But for us I mean [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2833.94s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's just a unique situation, but we got it [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=2835.94s)]

*  What do you feel like if you had to be specific about it? Oh, I think Scott agrees with me [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=4867.06s)]
*  but sometimes when we make albums or projects and we [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=4872.58s)]
*  don't really like I [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=4877.34s)]
*  Don't know how to explain this there's been projects that we put out [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=4880.82s)]
*  That we thought were great and we wanted to do all these things for it and like they were great projects and they did their [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=4884.9800000000005s)]
*  Thing and like they came and went but there's been a couple where we didn't even think about it [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=4890.62s)]
*  And I don't know I have this weird feeling that this album is gonna be huge [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=4895.02s)]
*  Yeah, and I'm not just saying that to promote it or whatever [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=4899.02s)]
*  I'm not really one for self-promotion, but we both have this weird feeling like it's like when we don't try is what I'm trying [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=4901.34s)]
*  To say oh, yeah, we don't try we make a fucking masterpiece [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=4906.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, when we're trying too hard we make like some try-hard shit [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=4909.9800000000005s)]
*  Yes, it's good. Try hard shit. That's such a good term man. Yeah, that is good because sometimes we'll work on a clip or something [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=4913.06s)]
*  It's like after we kicked it. You can just tell like man force it [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=4918.820000000001s)]
*  Yes, we just try to shine this to or get it, you know do something and then we mess it up [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=4921.88s)]
*  I think it oh, I was just gonna you know, it gets like [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=4926.620000000001s)]
*  We never wanted to be in a box [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=4930.660000000001s)]
*  We said that from the beginning we wanted to be able to make whatever we wanted to make it anytime [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=4933.06s)]
*  But as you grow as you grow a fan base in this community [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=4937.5s)]
*  They get at they have expectations, you know [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=4942.1s)]
*  Luckily, I feel like a lot of them have grown with us. There's still some of those out there that that's still [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=4946.98s)]
*  Suicide balls is better in 2015. We went to those [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=4953.42s)]
*  You were better when you were on drugs, whatever but to his point [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=4956.98s)]
*  This is my favorite album same that you know [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=4962.78s)]
*  I feel like I say that a lot but like Kyle always says he's like dude y'all just get better and better and better [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=4965.62s)]
*  I don't understand it either. I'm 35 years old. I'm like [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=4970.7s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? I should be retiring soon, but I do think one thing that has helped [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=4974.22s)]
*  You know suicide boys sometimes can feel like a [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=4981.74s)]
*  Job yeah, because there's there's deadlines. There's like got to get it done. There's expectations [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=4986.54s)]
*  I think one thing that has helped like release the the valve a little bit and like let some of the pressure off [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=4992.5s)]
*  He's been doing duck boy [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=4998.62s)]
*  which is like his little going back to his roots and doing his band stuff and [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=5001.14s)]
*  experimenting and being able to be free and [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=5005.900000000001s)]
*  Same with me. I've been able to experiment with some some some sound solo eyes [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=5008.7s)]
*  And then when we do that, we you know, I feel like we feel refreshed we feel loose [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=5013.26s)]
*  Yeah, and then when we come back to SB, you know what I'm saying like excited. Yeah, the pressure like I don't know [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=5017.72s)]
*  I don't know how to feel like an individual I think because there's something that [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=5024.66s)]
*  I'm sure once you're in a group that part of your the individuality. It's there but it's it's [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=5028.38s)]
*  Partnered with something. Yes, so to be able to develop yourself more and then bring it to anything is probably [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=5036.86s)]
*  Pretty cool. Yeah, and it's still remind yourself that you can develop as an individual [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=5042.42s)]
*  And absolutely I bet that's that's interesting. Is there collabs and stuff on this? [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=5047.14s)]
*  No, no, we never we never really big on collabs, right? You guys don't do a lot of it [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=5051.9800000000005s)]
*  So is yeah, I was just wondering is it something you guys ever think about or do people reach out about it? [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=5056.54s)]
*  We were supposed to do something with ski mask recently [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=5060.94s)]
*  But the thing is dude if you don't catch us when you catch us, right? [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=5064.3s)]
*  You're gonna be waiting another year, right? [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=5068.46s)]
*  Because we move quick and if if you if you pass it up then like bro, we can't rewind and go back [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=5070.14s)]
*  We said we have a lot of shit on our own on our own plates that we have to get right [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=5075.82s)]
*  So that is the hardest part about how it happens is like getting it back in time [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=5079.06s)]
*  You know I'm saying like getting it done [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=5083.78s)]
*  I I think it's best whenever we like whenever we do joint projects like we did with germ shake [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=5085.38s)]
*  Well when we all get in a room together and we're able to just like pound it out for a week or two [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=5090.5s)]
*  We just lock ourselves in the room for a week and yeah. Yeah. I love listening to sick. Well, dude [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=5095.6s)]

*  Did you guys ever tour in any of the same circles as guys like Mac Miller? [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=5232.98s)]
*  Little peep those guys so fucking weird that you bring that up. We were just talking about this yesterday [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=5237.42s)]

*  And that festival is not a festival anymore because too many dudes were groping chicks like sexual assault style [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=5247.14s)]
*  Yeah, watch it dude. Yeah, watch it guys [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=5252.1s)]

*  Anyway Mac Miller was at this [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=5259.62s)]

*  But we're always curious about this but some of it you that you enjoy that surely right like it's probably good [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=5302.58s)]

*  You know, I think that's part of it. What do you think that has to do with sobriety? [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=5319.46s)]
*  Being a little bit [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=5323.860000000001s)]
*  Because I got like that dude, I would wake up at 1 p.m. On a Wednesday like it was nothing [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=5326.339999999999s)]

*  It's like and I remember back to relationships I was in I would get home my girl [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=5347.219999999999s)]
*  We'd have gone and done something and then next thing I know I always remember I'm on my computer [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=5352.0199999999995s)]

*  And then after a while she's gone. Yeah [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=5360.98s)]
*  Yeah, I've been in a relationship now almost four years and it's to your point [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=5364.98s)]
*  She was like she respects it, you know, she knows how I am. She knows how I work. She respects it [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=5371.0199999999995s)]
*  I can see I would get frustrating from the female point of view. She was like [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=5376.2s)]
*  Can you at least just start taking the weekends off and hanging out with me? And I was like, yeah, you got a point [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=5379.5s)]

*  Seven o'clock for the West Coast because with this job whatever you want to call it. There's no hours [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esE635f-au8&t=5390.820000000001s)]
