*  Snakes but fuck I think that's just more for fun in one town in Ecuador. They eat something called kui [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1530.74s)]
*  It's a rat. Oh, it's rat. It's like looks like a rat to me [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1538.1s)]
*  And I've been that time that like you and I I'm like no oh just delicious [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1542.06s)]

*  Leave the kui aside. I don't fuck around there. Yeah. Yeah, you never seen a cow in a dumpster, you know [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1552.54s)]
*  Yeah, that's the thing, you know, that's true, too. Um [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1558.84s)]
*  What are we talking about? Oh, we're so we're talking about that fight [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1562.78s)]
*  Do you think that there was anything that Stamman could have done to get out to get in a better situation? [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1565.02s)]
*  I think when he hit the single it was almost like he don't need the single to take him down [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1568.82s)]
*  It was more to don't get hit and that's why probably it was so easy to sing the choke and let's be also honest [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1575.1s)]
*  Those Russians guys came pretty prepared [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1581.74s)]
*  Like a necktie or they this this new magma thing is specific have a really good spinning will kick [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1585.02s)]
*  So like he hit him he started fight with two hard ones like the moment somebody do that to you [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1591.1799999999998s)]
*  I saw he get the hair a little bit. He kind of like was like fuck [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1596.34s)]
*  You throw that to me. I'm in your face [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1600.26s)]
*  I'm gonna I'm gonna try to take your head off right away because it's energy like if somebody hit you that hard you kind [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1602.82s)]
*  of like [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1608.4199999999998s)]
*  Don't do nothing about it. You let them get a step ahead and get a step ahead [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1609.34s)]
*  So no, I do see what you're saying. Like I mean, I don't know I mean, you know, like [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1613.54s)]
*  But I know what you're saying like I always wonder [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1618.58s)]
*  Yeah, what the energy is like in there because we just see the fight, you know [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1621.7s)]
*  It's hard to get an idea of what that mono we mono like it's a conditioning like you have to pretend [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1625.78s)]
*  Sometimes do you have to almost like you have to keep this force field up? [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1632.54s)]
*  Even if there's something that hurt do you have to like keep an energy right there? [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1635.82s)]
*  I'm gonna say it's okay to be hurting. We're not invisible. We got we're not meant for fighting [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1639.46s)]
*  But once you decide that you're gonna be your life the moment you get hurt [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1645.44s)]
*  You gotta either go for a walk. You gotta either [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1649.86s)]
*  Step on the gas but you cannot just try to avoid the fight because your opponent will notice no it's [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1653.74s)]
*  You can't you can see the colors like like like more so come but you know when you get hit goes down [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1661.66s)]
*  it's almost like you can sense that and [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1666.62s)]
*  Wow, I'm really good at least with that. I can I can tell where my opponent [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1669.46s)]
*  It's ready to die. Like it's a hard fucking guy or it's a guy that is kind of like, you know what? [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1674.34s)]

*  Like even if you are a famous person and you're a piece of shit [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1832.54s)]
*  I'm like, I don't want to be part of that. Yeah, this is not worth it. There's no reward in that. So [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1836.1399999999999s)]
*  For me, it's it's more about that than anything else [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1842.82s)]
*  When you look at like where you're at now with fighting and you look at [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1846.5800000000002s)]
*  Your division is there is there a fight that kind of tempts you is there fight like I know people talk about [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1851.46s)]
*  Cruz people talk about O'Malley people talk about [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1858.1000000000001s)]
*  Who's up there Sandhagens in your division, isn't he? [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1862.22s)]
*  Yeah, I love I think I think that was a fight to make I get offers and hug in February 19 [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1864.6200000000001s)]
*  Really many Ben and it never happened [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1871.1000000000001s)]
*  I definitely don't think he run away from the fight [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1873.98s)]
*  He's a he's a solid fighter, but I think it's hurt or something like that. So many more time [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1877.74s)]
*  He just had that big he had a big fight against yawn. Yeah, that was a great fight [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1883.54s)]
*  That was a great fight, but maybe he needs surgery [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1886.94s)]
*  I don't know but the one they offer me that it didn't took me like a minute to say like you send the contract and [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1889.5s)]
*  Then that never happened. So I don't want to waste time. I'm ready to go right. Do you feel like you get enough fights in? [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1895.8200000000002s)]
*  in [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1902.34s)]
*  Yeah, I fight three three times a year normally this past year [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1903.54s)]
*  I did twice but when you get to the point like you're fighting like Edgar all those guys you're [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1907.6999999999998s)]
*  You can fight six times a year. You're fighting the top guys [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1914.6999999999998s)]
*  You have to just wait for the top guys, right? [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1917.9599999999998s)]
*  Because there's guys that they're not ranked and when I wasn't ranked the guys in the top ten don't want to fight me [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1919.9599999999998s)]
*  There's no reward right and I get it is a business [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1925.9399999999998s)]
*  So I don't I don't cry about it in near end even when I when I was low or when I'm high [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1928.54s)]
*  So now I just gotta wait for a top five guy [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1934.98s)]
*  Or something that that makes sense and what fight is ahead what fight is still hat because I don't even know if there's any [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1937.94s)]
*  Banned weight fights on the docket right now are there no not right now. Like I think [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1943.02s)]
*  The dog is firing more eyes, but they're below me anyway [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1948.46s)]
*  The only guys ahead of me is my rap font son hagen [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1953.1s)]
*  All done Cruz. Yeah and [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1957.5s)]
*  Cruzey kindly three four times already [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1959.82s)]
*  He's he you you guys aren't gonna fight you don't think or they call me they offer us to fight multiple times [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1962.86s)]
*  He's an interesting guy. It's kind of like um, he reminds me of like [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1969.78s)]
*  He almost reminds me of Tom Cruise the actor and we're cuz he like he's had a great career [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1973.8999999999999s)]
*  You know, he said all these he's had a really illustrious career long career [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1979.06s)]
*  And he's also this kind of like unique mysterious kind of dude, you know [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1982.3999999999999s)]
*  He when I hear him talk he sounds he sounds too smart. He tried to like say [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1986.62s)]
*  Perfect things and be perfect and he take his time [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1993.8s)]
*  But I don't know him personally like we do the commentary. He does in English. I go to in Spanish [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=1997.0s)]
*  so we cross paths often and I call him out all the time, but I [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2002.32s)]
*  Just keep it real when I see him. I say I say what's up, you know, if he's a fuck you [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2007.3999999999999s)]
*  They might guess we're fighting right. He's not like that in a way, but you think he wants that fight [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2011.36s)]
*  Maybe there's cuz it hit for him at this point [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2016.2199999999998s)]
*  It's kind of what does he want to do really for honestly a guy like that? [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2018.4799999999998s)]
*  I'm guessing he's just he's just one big fight, right? [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2022.84s)]
*  But you know, he is coming off a win [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2025.6s)]
*  I'm coming off a win I think makes sense because it's just I think his number is six or something like that [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2029.02s)]
*  He's not too high up there [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2034.1999999999998s)]
*  But they offer us to fight three times already and he just declined it [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2036.04s)]
*  So somebody declared it that much. I'm not losing my time, right? You can't keep calling it [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2041.36s)]
*  Maybe it's just not what they want. No, especially if maybe yeah, you don't sometimes you don't know [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2045.68s)]
*  I guess maybe what the fighters plan is or what their path is. Yeah, that's why like [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2049.68s)]
*  I told him like just just send me the contract with anybody higher than me and and it's only [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2054.28s)]
*  It's a regular wrestler and I'm training everything so I'm not worried about [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2060.96s)]
*  Specific things we had a question that came in here right here [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2066.18s)]
*  Here we go [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2071.5s)]
*  You can see it that good, but you'll be able to see it enough. I think [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2073.22s)]
*  Are we gonna need the headphones for this? Yes, sir. We can hear him for sure [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2076.7799999999997s)]
*  What's up cheeto, um, oh and Theo cheeto Theo Theo cheeto, I don't know [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2082.98s)]
*  I just wanted to ask this that fight against Sean O'Malley [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2089.9s)]
*  Every single time I just keep not talking but hearing about it and I have to keep talking about how [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2093.82s)]
*  Honestly, you won the fight. So my question is [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2100.46s)]
*  When are you gonna get the belt when are you gonna go for the belt to be honest, that's the real question [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2106.82s)]
*  But no, yeah, honestly cheeto. I'm a huge fan. I [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2111.7000000000003s)]
*  Think oh you just kind of answered that really too [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2116.1000000000004s)]
*  I think even just like you were saying the only yeah [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2118.38s)]
*  What would the path for you to get to the belt be like I wonder I I believe at the moment [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2121.1s)]
*  if I get a fight with somebody in the top five, I'm a fight away from there because [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2128.34s)]
*  Either my fight with Aldo, even if I lost a fight by decision [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2134.2200000000003s)]
*  Coming coming to the third round. He was pretty defeated. He was very tired and [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2138.7000000000003s)]
*  After that I get I get too cocky I get too excited and I pay the price of that [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2143.1s)]
*  I went too hard too fast. He took my back and he hold me there [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2148.4199999999996s)]
*  So I will never sit down and it was I'm putting excuses like oh he is hold me down. No, I'm [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2151.9399999999996s)]
*  Right. I'm responsive. I'm the idiot that couldn't get out. Yeah, and I put myself in that position [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2158.22s)]
*  So I I just taking it like a man and I definitely work on that. I've been a I took like six months [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2164.06s)]
*  Working on don't get hold in that specific position and I believe I figured it out even when Frankie took my back [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2171.42s)]
*  I was like out quick. So that was something that I'm glad I [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2177.98s)]
*  Fix and an improvement. Yeah, and after that Aldo went and kicks [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2183.5800000000004s)]
*  Fonts us he beat up Munoz pretty well [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2188.1000000000004s)]
*  So that just put me in a good position because he couldn't do none of that to me. Yeah [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2191.06s)]
*  So that can set up set us up for a rematch [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2196.0800000000004s)]
*  Easily I feel I can do a fight for tower elimination with him or I can just fight somebody like Merab [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2199.94s)]
*  That is a tough wrestler [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2207.7000000000003s)]
*  Nobody can beat him lately and he can take you down and hold you down [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2211.02s)]
*  So if I go in there and I just put him out [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2214.86s)]
*  Like simple because no one called him out for reasons. He's not popular [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2218.54s)]
*  He's boring but it's effective he wins right he don't talk shit but he wins right so if I go in there and just [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2224.42s)]
*  Clean cut put him out [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2231.98s)]
*  Stomp him. Yeah, okay that that's how you [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2234.7s)]
*  That's a crazy shit that you do and people is like fuck this gets real right? I'm not worried about anybody [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2238.94s)]
*  It's not like some fighters are like they have a path to the title that is very well done [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2245.14s)]
*  Okay fight this guy he's a heavy puncher. Okay clinching. Okay. Now you're fighting a good grappler. Don't go to the ground, right? [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2251.5s)]
*  I'm willing to fight good or bad fights because I know one thing if you're ready [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2257.78s)]
*  You have a chance to put him out you have a chance to get away with something [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2263.02s)]
*  I'm not worried about the striker or the wrestler [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2267.3s)]
*  Because I do it all do you ever sometime you're in there [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2271.34s)]
*  Do you ever forget that you do you like kicking or punching more? That's one sometime? [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2275.2200000000003s)]
*  I'm always wondering do these guys like to kick more punch more do you ever forget that? [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2279.02s)]
*  We'll answer that first you like to kick or punch more. I like both like I don't like now that I'm with parillo [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2283.18s)]
*  He's a great boxer [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2289.58s)]
*  I feel my punches are getting pretty crisp and that just helped my kicks to be better because if I can punch you I [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2290.82s)]
*  Can click some people have no punching and just kick right? Yeah, but then when somebody put a good combo then they get clip [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2297.34s)]
*  So I feel like now that I I get my boxing my base pretty good [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2305.2999999999997s)]
*  I can kick better than before just because I fix little mechanics with the human. I [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2309.1s)]
*  Feel like I'm very complete now [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2315.7799999999997s)]
*  I feel like there are things like people who want to take me down now [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2318.46s)]
*  Which I train with one of the best people in the world in the ground anyway [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2320.86s)]
*  So I'm not even I'm just not worried right like I'm and there are things like some people is very talented [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2325.24s)]
*  But then you can get them tired [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2330.86s)]
*  Good luck trying to get me tired. Yeah, just good luck with that. Yeah, it's never happened. He's not gonna happen [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2333.1400000000003s)]
*  He's never happened before it's never happened probably since you were born man. I think yeah, because [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2339.3s)]
*  Yeah, I'm a very active person [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2345.26s)]
*  I'm like if you want to get me tired I can guarantee you will get tired in the process and [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2347.94s)]
*  It's just a mindset like yeah, I'm willing to get on heart attack [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2353.42s)]
*  That's what I think when I'm running when I'm sprinting when I'm a sport like I'm just pushing the pace [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2356.94s)]
*  You're willing to have a heart attack all the time. That's what I told myself when I'm doing a sprint when I'm a sparring [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2361.34s)]
*  I'm a human I feel the same shit you feel but I can control that feeling I can tell myself [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2367.0600000000004s)]
*  It's okay to feel like that. I just make friends with with those demons and he's like [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2372.6200000000003s)]
*  I just keep them close because I can tell you all the crazy shit in the world [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2377.98s)]
*  I can lie to you can tell you fuck [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2383.7000000000003s)]
*  That my dick is bigger four inches more than normal is but I will never lie to myself [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2386.94s)]
*  So you gotta keep it real I have the same feeling my chest is burning my legs are tired my forearm are gas [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2391.42s)]
*  But it's okay. It's just okay. I like that idea of making friends with those things [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2397.9s)]
*  You know you have to of keeping those demons close. I yeah when I get to the part where my heart's beating [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2403.02s)]
*  I'm just like damn I might die but you say hey [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2408.3799999999997s)]
*  I [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2411.1200000000003s)]
*  Just say that it's cool to feel that and just keep going what's gonna happen heart attack doesn't lose [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2412.44s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? That's all losing. No. No, that's just one round is when you break your leg [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2418.44s)]
*  I'm not saying I want that to happen to me [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2423.6000000000004s)]
*  But if you kick somebody in your leg snapping twice, you're not getting I did say TKO [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2425.6400000000003s)]
*  But it's only somebody right. It's only somebody kick your ass. So something really bad happened to you in the process [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2430.6800000000003s)]
*  So when I'm throwing a kick or a punch [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2437.0800000000004s)]
*  That's a mindset I have I'm like I'm gonna break myself through you. Yeah and [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2439.64s)]
*  works pretty good when you [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2445.0s)]
*  when when you were in the O'Malley fight [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2448.04s)]
*  Did you feel like at the end of that fight that he had given? [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2451.04s)]
*  When you got him on the ground you're on top of did you feel like he'd given up at that point [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2458.14s)]
*  Did it feel like that because obviously he was injured like he was injured and that happened the same to [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2461.9s)]
*  Sehul happened to Chandler right before so [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2468.56s)]
*  It happened to me but in my arm like John Linnicker punched like a truck and he punched me in the elbow and my arm went numb [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2472.56s)]
*  It's this like I'm not a doctor, but I think like this if a nerve get affected and [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2481.24s)]
*  You start like panicking your nervous system goes firing up [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2487.3599999999997s)]
*  So I was just telling myself like my arm was numb [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2491.04s)]
*  Just take my time just run around a little bit clinching wherever I'm going back to normal [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2494.1800000000003s)]
*  So I was just like it is okay to have something like that right to have that happen [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2499.0600000000004s)]
*  We actually Sean actually sent this question in and let's say is it okay if we play it [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2504.7000000000003s)]
*  I don't want you to feel like we have to oh bro. Come on. Okay, cool [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2509.3s)]
*  Let me see what these dogs and look his literally we just put it. He just sent it in through like the regular channel [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2511.86s)]
*  He didn't send it to me. He just said I believe that through the drop. Let's see what he say [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2516.92s)]
*  Cheetah what up, bro? It's your friend to Sean. I'm just wondering if you actually thought you won that one fight [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2521.46s)]
*  Let me know your thoughts. I will Theo says he doesn't think it counted. I know [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2529.06s)]
*  I did not say that it's cool. It doesn't know anything about me. I won't get offended by that shit [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2533.58s)]
*  Oh, I didn't say but I I know you didn't okay [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2539.42s)]
*  But if you were if you told me right now, bro, I don't think you want the family cool [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2541.98s)]
*  No, I just I was rewatching it the other day and I was just I don't know what it's like [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2545.78s)]
*  To be in a fight like that, right? So I was wondering if if I'm [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2549.98s)]
*  You know if I'm something happens to me where I feel impaired, right? Do I then get into a situation where I? [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2554.62s)]
*  Give where I'm just like it's I'm out. I'm gonna live to fight another day, right? [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2562.58s)]
*  Or and then if you're in the ring with them, do you are you able to know that? [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2567.34s)]
*  You know when when I when the fight started and I started walking towards him [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2571.62s)]
*  Walking towards him like most guys kind of like run away from him. He's rangy and he can be clowning [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2578.02s)]
*  He come like I dyed my hair colorful [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2584.7s)]
*  Many times to we look funky and people sometimes it like because you have pink in your hair [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2587.58s)]
*  You're not tough or something. That's your looks like I'm not most people think he wrote he's not training. He's fucking around [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2594.06s)]
*  He's just another fighter doing his job doing wherever right people get full by the way [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2602.54s)]
*  We act if you hear all the shit I say sometimes you would think I'm not this person [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2608.22s)]
*  But it's just the easy way I'm talking shit [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2612.74s)]
*  99% of the day. Yeah, and most of the time I don't mean none of that. I'm just talking shit, right? [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2615.7s)]
*  People get fooled by that. They when I was when I was fighting him and he was talking I [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2621.58s)]
*  Don't have one day that I see done and pay attention to anything [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2627.54s)]
*  I was like I'm gonna fucking see in the case, bro [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2631.54s)]
*  Yeah, and I am the type of person that let's see he pop up right now and he say something I don't like [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2633.8199999999997s)]
*  I'm not sitting down. I'm gonna fucking go and throw at him. Yeah, like right away. Yeah, I don't have those issues [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2640.14s)]
*  So that's why this shit talking or promise [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2646.14s)]
*  He doesn't give me or take nothing away from me. Right? It's just normal and Sean's a real master of communicate [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2650.02s)]
*  He's a great like he's doing a good job. He's doing a good job. He's a great character [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2655.72s)]
*  He's a great character good for him. Like I'm not and fighter and he's a great fighter [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2660.04s)]
*  He can fight did but yeah, did you feel like you won at the end? That was yeah [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2664.4399999999996s)]
*  I wasn't mad or bug about the way one I kick him in the leg [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2669.08s)]
*  He should give up that wasn't an injury on his ankle [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2673.8399999999997s)]
*  That wasn't the same thing that happened when he fought Sukhanta which [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2676.8399999999997s)]
*  Sukhanta if you're fucking a part of half a broken foot, why you take him down, bro? [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2680.9199999999996s)]
*  Like why you don't let him stand up and just kick his ass, but that's also what they call [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2685.8399999999997s)]
*  Being a little smart in a fight. If my opponent break his feet, why you take him down you making him a failure [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2691.8799999999997s)]
*  Right just just just let him yeah awkward and the referee will stop it [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2697.68s)]
*  When I was walking him down, I [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2702.24s)]
*  Felt his energy [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2704.7999999999997s)]
*  He don't he don't like pressure and most guys [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2706.56s)]
*  Want to go too crazy at him? I took my time [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2710.24s)]
*  Yeah, like he throw punches, but I saw them coming he's very he's very sharp with his hands [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2712.84s)]
*  But if you're calm and cool, you can see them coming, you know, I don't close my eyes in there [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2718.08s)]
*  Well, I don't think you close your eyes to anything in the world. It doesn't seem like [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2724.08s)]
*  Do you have they pitched you that fight again? Yeah, they offered me to fight him [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2728.1600000000003s)]
*  When he fought in the McGregor car. Oh, yeah, I was at that fight. Oh against that the green hair boy [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2733.8s)]
*  Yeah, they're great hair boy man never fought again [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2740.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, that guy he's still getting hit somewhere that guy took a lot of hits [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2742.44s)]
*  Yeah, he can take punches in the face. Yeah, but that also say [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2746.7999999999997s)]
*  Like if you punch somebody that many times you don't punch it that hard, right? Yeah [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2751.3999999999996s)]
*  O'Malley's is nappy. I give him that but if you punch somebody that many times [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2756.56s)]
*  That's a good point. Oh, yeah, bro. Okay guy. He punched him as many times you could punch somebody [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2761.64s)]
*  I don't think you could punch somebody any more times [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2767.12s)]
*  No, even if you knew somebody their whole life and you didn't like them, I don't think you could punch [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2770.08s)]
*  That was awful that was an awful fight I believe like what type of competition is that and I think that's also why people [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2777.24s)]
*  Took shit on him, which I don't give a fuck what people say or not about him. But going back I think I won [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2784.08s)]
*  Yeah, I was happy with it, but I also live it in the past. I don't leave of that shit [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2791.12s)]
*  Right. I don't give a shit who he is or what he does for living [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=2796.36s)]

*  We don't have the sources in Ecuador. We don't have the teammates. We don't have a [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=3660.84s)]

*  To a place where people can see you talking about that place, right? [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=3776.14s)]

*  See it's all yeah the whole it's always been that way, but that's what that's what that's why they say [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=3960.5s)]
*  America is not the USA it's [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=3966.26s)]
*  America is the fucking continent like South America Central America like [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=3969.54s)]
*  This country's got a little bit of the best of everything yeah, yeah, and look and it's got opportunity [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=3974.46s)]
*  You know it just has opportunity [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=3980.98s)]
*  And people will come off from anywhere to get it what was there another great moment from that that you enjoyed from last night [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=3982.98s)]
*  last night [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=3988.54s)]
*  For yeah, what do you think of that other other? I'm thinking of the Moreno the outcome I [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=3990.8599999999997s)]
*  I [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=3996.98s)]
*  Is I hate when I know the guys because I want them to win and if I was so close I [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=3999.02s)]
*  Think I think they could give it to him, but also [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=4004.8599999999997s)]
*  What's his name figure eight oh was being a smart on don't throw first [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=4011.14s)]
*  Because he will be counter pretty easy, so he was almost waiting for big shots [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=4016.42s)]
*  And there was two different rounds if I'm the wrong he thought him and [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=4021.58s)]
*  Moreno went down. I think one of them wasn't a real one [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=4027.5s)]
*  Well one was a real knockdown when he put the choke and ten seconds left that joke was fully sink [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=4031.7s)]
*  So that was a little scary was he saved by the bell you think there maybe I? [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=4037.2799999999997s)]
*  We have to say yes because he was like he could have scrambled out [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=4042.42s)]
*  But it was fully on and then [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=4045.74s)]
*  He run out of time so that was a good thing for Moreno [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=4048.7799999999997s)]
*  but then there was one that he get touch with a jab and he [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=4052.54s)]
*  Went to the ground, but it was more like odd balance, but we don't know that [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=4057.54s)]
*  It could be a real knockdown and then I think the referee [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=4061.3799999999997s)]
*  I think it was three to two maybe because of that but Moreno put more and since I was there I saw [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=4065.46s)]
*  Figueroa [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=4073.7s)]
*  Pretty hurt more than once like almost ready to go down [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=4075.06s)]
*  But I just feel like Moreno was being very patient if you were to step in the gas [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=4079.18s)]
*  I think you could finish him hmm [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=4085.14s)]
*  And do you think that's something that you learn as a fighter if you're in there like not to like to be careful of your [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=4087.18s)]
*  Counterpunches like sometimes you you learn like oh [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=4092.5s)]
*  When I counter or when I punch first they're countering better like especially the last fight like like [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=4095.02s)]
*  Figueroa came pretty strong and Moreno just counter him until he just took him down and finish him and [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=4101.58s)]
*  This time he wasn't that aggressive. He was waiting more for Moreno and those low kicks also [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=4108.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, pretty heavy [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=4113.62s)]
*  It was an exciting fight. It was a great fight last 20 seconds where they just said let's go they went max [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=4115.62s)]
*  Holloway Ricardo Lama's they point to the ground say fuck you. It was a great fight, dude [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=4121.12s)]
*  It was a great fight the whole crowd was booing heavy so [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=4126.179999999999s)]
*  If you if you will be a clean decision that I don't think the crowd will boo that bad [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=4131.5s)]
*  I I felt like that I felt like if it was a time I felt like they may should maybe just made it a draw [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=4135.94s)]
*  exactly like they make the first time like a draw will be great, but [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=4141.66s)]
*  Being a judge is a shitty job. I know they sometimes like they make oh like that wasn't [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=4146.7s)]
*  Like that could go to Moreno, but sometimes they make some decisions [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=4153.62s)]
*  Which fight you were looking like like that, but that the whole world gets crazy on it and [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=4158.58s)]
*  But being a judge is a shitty job, but none of those guys are martial arts [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=4165.219999999999s)]
*  None of those guys have a full background. That's crazy, isn't it? [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=4170.219999999999s)]
*  most of the [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=4174.339999999999s)]
*  There's one referee the one judge that I get to talk to him and I asked him like like where you came from like [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=4175.46s)]
*  Like what you know about MMA is like I'm a boxing referee. I'm like, oh you're fucked [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=4181.98s)]
*  Who isn't a boxing referee? Yeah, like so everybody is yeah, like you have to separate their head, but yeah [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=4187.46s)]
*  I guess no big punch and then no clinching of course [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=4194.14s)]
*  But but that's just like crime like I feel like if you go on trial for murder or something [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=4198.22s)]
*  The people in the box should all be murderers, you know the jury [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=4202.86s)]
*  Because at least then they're gonna be able to be like, oh, yeah [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=4207.74s)]
*  He did it or didn't if you're getting somebody that works at a bakery or something [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=4210.68s)]
*  They don't fucking you know I'm saying like yeah, yeah the way [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=4213.98s)]
*  Law works, too. It's crazy. They're like like it's just thinking about like it's just random people saying [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=4217.62s)]
*  innocent [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=4225.58s)]

*  they're working like [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=4230.339999999999s)]
*  The judges but better is better and putting that fake her that he used back in the day and make a movie about it [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=4231.98s)]
*  Yeah, it is crazy. The system seems a little crazy [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=4238.459999999999s)]
*  But I don't know what else we would do maybe let a machine do it, you know [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=4241.82s)]
*  Yeah, well, I long most can figure that out. Yeah, maybe he will then you put it your Tom Princes guilty [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=4245.82s)]

*  That the lie detector nothing the war that thing looks horrible. It looks so rickety [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=4257.74s)]
*  Huh, it looks like it wouldn't even start your car. You know, I'm like this thing was like a piece of shit [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=4263.54s)]
*  No [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=4268.42s)]
*  The season is pretty fucked up the way things work [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=4269.62s)]
*  But somebody had one in our neighborhood growing up had a lie detector test and then we were always using it and shit [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=4273.14s)]

*  Do you get is it hard not to try and become that kind of energy? [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=4299.72s)]
*  I notice it in my own world. Like I noticed some guys have bigger personalities [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=4304.04s)]
*  So sometimes I'm like do I need to get a bigger personality? [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=4307.68s)]
*  Is it does it get tempting to try and [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppG869Wcapk&t=4312.56s)]
