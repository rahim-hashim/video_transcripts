# Cold Beach  This Past Weekend w Theo Von #413
**Theo Von - This Past Weekend:** [October 18, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs)
*  We got new merch, some new colorways in the Be Good to Yourself collection. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=0.0s)]
*  We've got hoodies in plum and moss. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=7.0s)]
*  We've also got t-shirts in lilac, moss, and blue mist. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=11.0s)]
*  I hope you enjoy those. Those are good colors. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=17.0s)]
*  Get that hitter and more at thetheovonstore.com. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=20.0s)]
*  That's it. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=24.0s)]
*  I mean, summer is, it's a wrap on summer. That's done. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=27.0s)]
*  That's done. You can't. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=31.0s)]
*  You still see some people. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=34.0s)]
*  I was on the interstate the other day and when, they had some family driving to the beach and I just, you know. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=36.0s)]
*  In the backseat you could see the kid with like a little sandpail and, you know, and he had like a little bucket or a little, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=43.0s)]
*  you know, you just saw the hope and possibility in his eyes and then you just realized, damn, man, his family taking him to the cold beach. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=54.0s)]
*  And that's definitely, you know, when I was young, we had to do the cold beach, you know, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=64.0s)]
*  because it's certainly, you know, rich people don't realize when they leave the beach [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=71.0s)]
*  that there's that, you know, that other tier of humanity that rolls into the beach, maybe when that bitch is cold, because it's cheaper. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=78.0s)]
*  You get your hotel room, $19 in there. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=88.0s)]
*  Thirty one dollars. All you can sleep. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=93.0s)]
*  They get you in that, but yeah, everybody's in that bitch. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=98.0s)]
*  You have seven, twelve, damn, nineteen children in there. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=101.0s)]
*  In a two bed, in a deluxe or something, two bed deluxe or something, one sink. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=106.0s)]
*  I don't know how they divide it up nowadays or whatever, you know, free ice and all of that. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=112.0s)]
*  You're at the beach. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=120.0s)]
*  And I remember, man, we'd go down to the cold beach and, you know, and mom tries to act like it's hot, like it's going to be, it's fine, it's warm. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=123.0s)]
*  And nobody's out there except other poor, just people don't even know how to use the beach, you know. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=130.0s)]
*  People only don't even know what's going on. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=138.0s)]
*  People, some guy out there eating sunscreen with a spoon, just people just, you know, that shan't be that shan't be even at the beach. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=142.0s)]
*  And they out there. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=152.0s)]
*  People, just poor people just building sand apartments. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=156.0s)]
*  You see that with they have the, and the kids make like a sand cop car. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=161.0s)]
*  And then they'll have a sand father getting put into the cop car. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=168.0s)]
*  He'll make like, damn, bro. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=172.0s)]
*  So you see a lot of when, you know, when poor people hit the beach, it's a little bit different. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=176.0s)]
*  You know, a lot more people come out there with attack dogs. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=183.0s)]
*  You'll see, you know, somebody out there with a big attack, with a Rottweiler. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=186.0s)]
*  And that he's out there, you know, catching crabs and shit. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=192.0s)]
*  He's out there, you know, he'll run them Rottweilers are powerful to. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=197.0s)]
*  They'll run right, he'll run half, you know, into the waves and come out with a just a damn sturgeon in their mouth. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=203.0s)]
*  You know, you send a dang. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=211.0s)]
*  What are those dogs, Zach, that kill people every year? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=215.0s)]
*  Pitbulls? Yeah, you'll see somebody out there have a pit bull run out into the water. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=219.0s)]
*  He'll come back with four frisbees and a damn mackerel. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=224.0s)]
*  And a couple of, and his hair corn road. You see that shit, you know. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=228.0s)]
*  That's when poor people hit the beach. That's when it's cold. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=234.0s)]
*  And people don't realize that there's no sun out there. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=239.0s)]
*  It's mostly just crabs and a lot of jellyfish. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=244.0s)]
*  You know, a lot of high fructose jellyfish, too. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=252.0s)]
*  And they out there. But people forget that what it's like. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=256.0s)]
*  Yeah, nothing like a, um, a cold trip to the cold beach. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=262.0s)]
*  My mother would take us over there to Biloxi, Mississippi. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=267.0s)]
*  And I don't even know if this beach was incorporated. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=273.0s)]
*  It might have still been barely a LLC, if that. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=276.0s)]
*  I mean, it would, they had like a lot of this. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=280.0s)]
*  The water by the edge had like this froth on it. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=284.0s)]
*  It looked like, um. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=287.0s)]
*  It looked like, uh, there had been some like, um, I don't know if like [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=291.0s)]
*  vomiting or maybe like fish had been vomiting over there. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=297.0s)]
*  It just like they had a, I can't even explain it, man. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=301.0s)]
*  The edge of the water where it hit the shore had like, um, a lot of foam. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=305.0s)]
*  It looked like a top of a beer. That's what it looked like. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=311.0s)]
*  It looked like a lot of the water was probably had beer in it. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=315.0s)]
*  And if you, if you grew up along the coast, especially the Gulf of Mexico, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=319.0s)]
*  and I think even some, I think it, I think it happens in a lot of places [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=323.0s)]
*  where the B it gets a little, you know, you're like, damn, this water looks sick. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=327.0s)]
*  The water looks like it's not doing well. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=334.0s)]
*  Like you should, you know, put a blanket on it. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=337.0s)]
*  I mean, I don't know how you would even do that, but it's like the, it just. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=341.0s)]
*  So anyway, we went to the damn poor beach and I, you know, and the vendors there, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=344.0s)]
*  they vent, they, they, you know, the warm weather was over. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=348.0s)]
*  So you'd go to the hot dog stand or whatever and they'd be selling just gum. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=351.0s)]
*  And you're like, gum. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=355.0s)]
*  Fuck. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=357.0s)]
*  You know, you get you nine pieces of gum. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=359.0s)]
*  The guy would sometimes shape the gums and you're like a wiener [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=361.0s)]
*  and put three other gums on the side, make a little Frank, you know, a little bread, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=365.0s)]
*  a little like, damn this shit. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=369.0s)]
*  Take you eight hours to eat that bitch. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=372.0s)]
*  Because you know, gum, it kind of fights back a little bit when you try to eat it. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=374.0s)]
*  If you're just chewing gum, it'll work with you. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=379.0s)]
*  But if you, if you really try to eat it, it'll, it'll want it, you know, gum. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=381.0s)]
*  Don't want all that. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=386.0s)]
*  You know, you know, when you swallow gum that you are not supposed to. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=389.0s)]
*  Gum is, you know, it's halfway to plastic, man. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=394.0s)]
*  But anyway, yeah, it's fall time. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=400.0s)]
*  It's, you know, this is where we are. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=405.0s)]
*  This is what's going on. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=407.0s)]
*  I want to thank everybody who came out recently. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=408.0s)]
*  We went and did some shows out there. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=412.0s)]
*  Wichita, Omaha and Denver. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=415.0s)]
*  It was, it was wonderful, man. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=419.0s)]
*  Wichita, you know, it's a real, there's not a lot going on in the city. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=421.0s)]
*  So when you see people during the, it almost feels like during the day, it's like a, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=426.0s)]
*  it has a very kind of like war torn vibe. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=433.0s)]
*  You know, it's not a lot of people running around. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=436.0s)]
*  You know, it's almost like if you see someone, you ask them, you know, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=439.0s)]
*  you know, if everything's okay or if they need water, it's like, you know, it has that kind of, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=443.0s)]
*  you know, you, you don't, and if you see somebody, you almost hug them [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=449.0s)]
*  because you don't know if you're going to see nobody again. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=452.0s)]
*  But then the shows at night, people flock in. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=457.0s)]
*  And so I think it's more, I don't know what it is. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=461.0s)]
*  I don't know if maybe people were just working out in the yard, like in the, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=464.0s)]
*  what's the yard of a city called? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=470.0s)]
*  Like the suburbs or whatever, like the surround, whatever. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=473.0s)]
*  Maybe people were working out there and then they came through. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=477.0s)]
*  But that was great. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=480.0s)]
*  Omaha, yeah, the Omaha, the venue there was, it was in like a dang orchestra place. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=482.0s)]
*  And I didn't know that. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=488.0s)]
*  And so that wasn't really the best choice for a comedy venue. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=491.0s)]
*  So that was real, real, you know, that was a felt a little ramshackle in that sense. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=496.0s)]
*  Like even right when we pulled up, they had people rolling out with like symphony instruments [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=503.0s)]
*  and somebody with a big harp, some dude with a damn harp, it was like, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=507.0s)]
*  damn, this dude, you got a damn harp over here. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=517.0s)]
*  And so, you know, he's probably fucking. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=521.0s)]
*  But yeah, that was, you know, there was just a lot of symphony play. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=526.0s)]
*  It was more built for a symphony. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=533.0s)]
*  It was, it was just interesting to do comedy in that room. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=535.0s)]
*  And then we went over to Denver. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=538.0s)]

*  We met a fella, this fella Dylan, I think his name seemed like a he was kind of like a just a man. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=614.0s)]
*  You know, when you saw him, you seemed like he seemed like a man you might ask directions from. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=626.0s)]
*  Look like he had directions. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=630.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? Like a reliable source. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=632.0s)]
*  Well, anyway, so he took us out. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=638.0s)]
*  We met him at a show and then he took us out to a horse farm and we got to ride on a horse. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=640.0s)]
*  And if you've never been on a horse, man, that bitch is a real. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=645.0s)]
*  It's a I mean, it reminds me of when I first had a power steering vehicle. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=651.0s)]
*  You know, my dad used to let me drive his cutlass. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=658.0s)]
*  He had a cutlass and I would drive that bitch and it probably weighed. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=661.0s)]
*  Maybe I don't know how much a car weighs, three thousand pounds or something. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=667.0s)]
*  How much does a car weighs that? Can you pull that up? [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=670.0s)]
*  And I mean, I and that thing, it had power steering. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=677.0s)]
*  I don't know. It didn't have that much power, but I mean, it was hard to steer. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=680.0s)]
*  It was almost like steering a boat. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=685.0s)]
*  It was I mean, in fact, it was horrible. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=687.0s)]
*  And I remember one time he went into the post office and I hit a couple of cars. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=689.0s)]
*  I took it for a quick spin around the block because my dad was real old. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=693.0s)]
*  So when he went into the post office, it take him, you know, twelve, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=697.0s)]
*  eighteen minutes to get there and back, you know, because he had that slow stride on him. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=700.0s)]
*  I mean, my dad just walked so slow, he had that age in him. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=706.0s)]
*  You know, he had all the years inside of him. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=709.0s)]
*  Every year you could he was just a damn fucking stack of calendars with lungs and heart. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=712.0s)]
*  And he would get out the car to go walk somewhere that you'd have all the time. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=719.0s)]
*  You could do whatever you wanted. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=722.0s)]
*  You had all the time in the world. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=724.0s)]
*  I mean, you had half a, you know, it took forever for him to come back. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=728.0s)]
*  So I remember he pull up at the post office. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=732.0s)]
*  He'd be like, I'm going to run inside. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=735.0s)]
*  And I knew that he meant walk. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=738.0s)]
*  And so he get up out the seat and I get in the driver's seat and take that bitch for a lap. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=742.0s)]
*  That brown cutlass and had some burn marks on the back. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=749.0s)]
*  Somebody tried to steal. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=753.0s)]
*  My dad had a bunch of M&Ms and different things and stuff that he gave away because he used to sign people up for credit cards at colleges and stuff. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=755.0s)]
*  And he was an alcoholic, but he he had a trunk full M&Ms one time. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=767.0s)]
*  And and they had a couple of people try to get in there and steal them and try to burn their way in, which was just dumb. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=773.0s)]
*  You know, I think to, you know, to try and just use regular fire to get through a trunk is just retarded, I think. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=783.0s)]
*  And no offense if anybody's retarded, bro. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=790.0s)]
*  But anyway, what was I talking about? [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=794.0s)]
*  Zach, yeah, I looked up the average weight of a car. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=797.0s)]
*  It's around three thousand four thousand pounds, but a cutlass was very heavy. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=799.0s)]
*  So I bet it's more close to four thousand. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=802.0s)]
*  Yeah, that bitch was heavy, man. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=804.0s)]
*  But my dad would get up and go walking, man. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=805.0s)]
*  He would do he would walk it, take a bird would land on him. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=807.0s)]
*  Not even they thought he was, you know, stationary. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=811.0s)]
*  He'd be that just day. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=814.0s)]
*  I mean, just barely going, you know, you'd see him come. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=816.0s)]
*  He was just. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=821.0s)]
*  It looked like they'd come and build a fountain around like a build a water thing and people start throwing pennies in. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=822.0s)]
*  He just then they'd be like, oh, damn, this guy's moving. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=828.0s)]
*  You know, this is not sorry. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=831.0s)]
*  My bad, sir. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=833.0s)]
*  And but he was just so slow, man. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=834.0s)]
*  My dad was so slow. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=838.0s)]
*  And so anyway, he'd go in the bank or the post office wherever. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=839.0s)]
*  And I'd get in that cutlass, that driver's seat, and I'd take that bitch for a spin. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=843.0s)]
*  And one time I took it around the block and I hit a couple of parked cars with that bastard. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=847.0s)]
*  Pop, pop, pop. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=851.0s)]
*  Damn, I hit them matches, Doug. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=856.0s)]
*  And I prayed for those people afterwards. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=858.0s)]
*  And, you know, so I did my part. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=861.0s)]
*  But so anyway, back to the horses. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=864.0s)]
*  So, yeah, this thing, man, being on a horse is really it's not for it's not for me, I don't think. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=867.0s)]
*  You know, we went out. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=875.0s)]
*  It's just that thing. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=877.0s)]
*  You don't know what's going to happen. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=878.0s)]
*  It's like it has a bunch of gears, but you don't have you don't know them. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=880.0s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=884.0s)]
*  It's like riding in a car. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=887.0s)]
*  It's like there's no like you have to like like that's one of the things. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=889.0s)]
*  It's a lot of secret code and that thing, man, it was hard. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=896.0s)]
*  And you're just bouncing up and down. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=900.0s)]
*  And you're like, dude, the whole time, like after like the fifth or sixth bounce, you're like, damn, dude, I think I'm gay, bro. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=902.0s)]
*  It's like it just I don't know what the long term goal is. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=909.0s)]
*  You know, I bet if you met jockeys when they first started a male jockey and then you met him again six, seven years later, bro, I bet he knows a few more men. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=913.0s)]

*  Dude, I was thinking about this about animals and humans. All right. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1311.0s)]
*  I think humans. I got this theory that like animals, because animals are on four legs, right? [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1315.0s)]
*  They're on four legs. So their earth, they're like really connected with nature, you know. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1324.0s)]
*  Humans are kind of the only species that isn't super connected with nature. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1331.0s)]
*  You know, we are, but we're also kind of not. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1337.0s)]
*  And one of the things that I was thinking about was because animals, they're on the earth, right? [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1341.0s)]
*  Their hands touch the earth and their legs. Right. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1347.0s)]
*  And so the earth kind of like it makes a circuit through their body. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1352.0s)]
*  So, you know, they're they're they, you know, they have a completed circuit with the earth. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1357.0s)]
*  And so it's like everything that the earth is, all the nature that's inside of the earth and the elements of nature that goes right through the animal, through its whatever legs or feet or arms and comes out, you know, it's just part of the circle, part of the cycle. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1363.0s)]
*  And then humans were standing up. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1379.0s)]
*  So we're kind of like this loose cable where it's like you got the energy, like the connection from the earth comes in, but then it starts rattling because it's not getting out. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1383.0s)]
*  You know, and I think that's one of like, I don't know if that's like if that made us develop like some of the way that we think because we have all this weird and like this energy that doesn't have like an outlet. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1396.0s)]
*  And I don't even know if this kind of makes sense, but I was part of me was then thinking, what if the energy that doesn't because usually if like you're part of nature, then, you know, the energy just comes up and goes out to you. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1413.0s)]
*  Right. You're you that connected loop with your because you're four legged. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1425.0s)]
*  But if you're two legged, then the energy is just going to come in and not be able to get out. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1430.0s)]
*  So then I wonder if maybe that's one of the reasons why we started thinking about having like gods and stuff like that, because before if the energy went right back into the earth and if we just knew we were part of the same source, you know, we knew it was all connected. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1438.0s)]
*  But if not, if it just the energy is kind of rattles in this cul-de-sac. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1453.0s)]
*  Then it I could see it start to manifest ideas of like like gods or higher powers or something like that because it's not connected to the source like it's supposed to be. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1458.0s)]
*  So I don't know if that makes any sense, but I feel like maybe we're supposed to be on four limbs. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1474.0s)]
*  You know, that's why I think when you do yoga and stuff, that stuff for you, it makes you feel so keyed in, you know. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1481.0s)]
*  Yeah. And the only like some other animals are on two legs. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1492.0s)]
*  You have let me see kangaroo. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1495.0s)]
*  Look at that bitch dog. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1498.0s)]
*  Now that bitch ain't doing well, bro. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1500.0s)]
*  Let's be honest, bro. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1505.0s)]
*  When you see a kangaroo, that bitch ain't doing well. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1507.0s)]
*  Dude, they making babies in their pocket. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1511.0s)]
*  They're fighting each look they got. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1514.0s)]
*  Yeah, they're fist fighting. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1515.0s)]
*  They're making babies in their in their. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1517.0s)]
*  You know, their uterus is like in a damn. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1522.0s)]
*  You know, they got like a fanny pack front uterus. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1527.0s)]
*  I don't know what they're doing there. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1529.0s)]
*  Yeah, they fight. Yeah, they got children hiding out there wiener hole or whatever. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1531.0s)]
*  I mean, it doesn't none of it makes. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1535.0s)]
*  Yeah, look at them. They're fighting. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1537.0s)]
*  They're beating people. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1538.0s)]
*  They had a couple of them ran through a fence somewhere the other day. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1540.0s)]
*  But I mean, and nothing about the animal looks like it's doing well either. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1543.0s)]
*  They look like somebody was trying to do something. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1548.0s)]
*  And then like the lab got busted. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1551.0s)]
*  You know, they look like some kind of Frankenstein dude was trying to put some shit together. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1554.0s)]
*  And then the cops rolled up and he was like, oh, fuck it. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1559.0s)]
*  I'm out of here. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1562.0s)]
*  And then that thing just beat through the damn drywall. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1563.0s)]
*  Bro, them bitches are gangbangers, son. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1567.0s)]
*  Dude, if you were I mean, if I'm sure in the animal kingdom, these are like the MS 13 of animals. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1571.0s)]
*  These are the bloods and the Crips and the what have you know. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1577.0s)]
*  I mean, these things will look at this. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1582.0s)]
*  I mean, here's one right here. My God. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1585.0s)]
*  I mean, this one, obviously. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1587.0s)]
*  I mean, this one, this one probably owns a yacht, bro. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1591.0s)]
*  I mean, these things are fucked up. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1594.0s)]
*  They're in a crypto. That's a fuck. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1597.0s)]
*  That's a kangaroo. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1599.0s)]
*  I mean, this thing is modeling. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1602.0s)]
*  You got to see some of these videos and get the picture down there with the Mexican kids. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1603.0s)]
*  He's trying to fit in with the family to get out of the country. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1607.0s)]
*  Look at this shit. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1609.0s)]
*  Dude, that thing is crazy, bro. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1612.0s)]
*  And look at that wiener and the Mexicans right there. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1615.0s)]
*  I mean, what's going on? [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1617.0s)]
*  But yeah, anything obviously. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1619.0s)]
*  So that's what we are. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1621.0s)]
*  We're almost like this kangaroo, but we're all it's just mostly in our head. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1622.0s)]
*  We don't know what's going on because we're stuck on two legs. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1626.0s)]
*  We're not completing the circuit. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1629.0s)]
*  So I think that's something that could have happened to humans is at some point, you know, whenever we got on two legs, it just. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1632.0s)]
*  You know, that energy gets stuck in our brain at the end of us. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1643.0s)]
*  So, of course, it would make our brain really advanced. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1646.0s)]
*  And then since we don't have our life sources, we're not connected back to the earth. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1649.0s)]
*  Then we would start to create a higher power. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1654.0s)]
*  We'd have to start to create some reason because I think if you're connected to the earth, you're a four legged animal. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1656.0s)]
*  Then the reason just flows through you and you know it. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1662.0s)]
*  So, I don't know, I was thinking about that. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1667.0s)]
*  You know, one thing I realized doing on tour busing was. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1672.0s)]
*  You got to really. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1677.0s)]
*  Know when to hold them and know when to fold them. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1680.0s)]
*  And I'm talking about defecation. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1685.0s)]
*  Doing number two's BMS. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1688.0s)]
*  Because it's like, you know, it's outlawed on a tour bus. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1691.0s)]
*  People don't be in on there. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1694.0s)]
*  You know, if you got to do duty or you got to really. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1697.0s)]
*  If you got something in your body that ain't pissed that wants to come out, then you got to do that on your own time. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1700.0s)]
*  And yeah, it makes sense on there. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1709.0s)]
*  It makes sense. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1711.0s)]
*  It's a it's like a code. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1712.0s)]
*  It's almost like a it's like a. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1714.0s)]
*  What's like a code of conduct? [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1716.0s)]
*  Like not Morse code. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1719.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's like an etiquette. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1722.0s)]
*  It's like a code of conduct. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1723.0s)]
*  Like we don't shoot. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1724.0s)]
*  We don't shit on here. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1725.0s)]
*  We don't do it. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1727.0s)]
*  You know, it's just like this thing. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1730.0s)]
*  It's like this battle cry. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1732.0s)]
*  And yeah, I get, you know, and some people have, you know, a lot of people ride that, you know, they're they're really. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1737.0s)]
*  You know, I probably defecate probably. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1744.0s)]
*  Maybe three times a week, right? [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1747.0s)]
*  And I've met friends that do it often, probably, you know, that are. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1751.0s)]
*  I think it's kind of taken the easy way out if you if you shit more than twice or three times a week to me, it's you're not even doing anything. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1757.0s)]
*  You're just shit. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1768.0s)]
*  I mean, I think there's a it's sort of a thing like, all right, do you know how tough am I? [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1771.0s)]
*  You know, and when I was young, it was always like that. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1778.0s)]
*  You know, my father didn't want us in there shitting all the time. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1785.0s)]
*  You know, he'd make us, you know, just be outside or say, you have better things to be doing. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1790.0s)]
*  It's kind of a weak man's game. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1796.0s)]
*  You know, my dad used to say, that's when the enemy gets you. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1799.0s)]
*  And he's kind of right, you know, because when you're in that, when you're in a feisty position, that's easily when you can get attacked. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1805.0s)]
*  And we had this one fell in our area. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1811.0s)]
*  This kid Bennett was his name, Bennett. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1813.0s)]
*  And I don't know what it stood for or if it didn't might not have stood for anything. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1816.0s)]
*  It could have just been it just was Bennett. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1821.0s)]
*  And he had he had this deal where if he had to, you could tell if he had to defecate or do poop. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1823.0s)]
*  He's he'd be start getting real quiet. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1833.0s)]
*  He'd start getting real quiet. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1838.0s)]
*  You can almost tell, you know, until he's almost silent and you'd have to tell him, man, go, go in there, go do it. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1839.0s)]
*  And the second he was empty, bro, he just a chatterbox. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1849.0s)]
*  It was almost like you couldn't fit words and poop in him at the same time. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1853.0s)]
*  You know, like he had some sort of this, this yen and yang inside of his body where there wasn't room enough for all of it because you'd catch him after lunch and he'd be a little quieter. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1857.0s)]
*  And then after dinner, if he hadn't gone to the bathroom, if he'd just forgotten to go and he just fell asleep in the morning, he'd just be almost damn deaf. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1868.0s)]
*  He'd just be almost a damn mute, bro. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1876.0s)]
*  And you just want to just I mean, you almost just damn go, boy. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1880.0s)]
*  Go so we can chat. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1885.0s)]
*  But yeah, Bennett, he just man, he wouldn't and people would get on them. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1887.0s)]
*  They'd be like, say something, bro. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1891.0s)]
*  Say something or go shit. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1893.0s)]
*  One or the other, you know, oh, Bennett, oh, oh, silent Bennett. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1897.0s)]
*  All full of shit, people would say, and he'd like, you know, give him thumbs up, like at least trying to, you know, say, yeah, yeah, I am, you know. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1906.0s)]
*  And he also was small in stature. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1916.0s)]
*  And you got to think about that if you got to defecate and you have if 10 percent of your body is occupied by, you know, duty or whatever, I don't know what, you know, what form it's in at that point. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1918.0s)]
*  Or how many stages it goes through. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1934.0s)]
*  But you got to think, damn, yeah, that's that's going to take up some time. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1936.0s)]
*  That's going to take up some space. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1942.0s)]
*  You know, that takes up a little bit of hard drive, I think. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1944.0s)]
*  So if you don't have that space free, it makes sense, kind of, you know, I mean, it's hard to think if you mean, if somebody asked me a hard question, sometimes I have to go. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1946.0s)]
*  I have to go. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1957.0s)]
*  Defecate or something for I can't even think about it. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1959.0s)]
*  And I don't, you know, I don't think that makes me dumb or anything, but I think. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1964.0s)]
*  It kind of makes me. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1971.0s)]
*  You know, I just got to hedge my bets. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1976.0s)]
*  You know, I just have to give myself the best case scenario. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1979.0s)]
*  Because it does make sense if your body's using energy to do one thing, it's not going to have energy to do another thing. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1984.0s)]
*  You know, that's why I think you always got to go if you can. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1991.0s)]
*  If there's something big coming up in your life, a wedding. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=1996.0s)]
*  You know, a birth driver's ed test. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2002.0s)]
*  You know, gun safety or whatever. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2008.0s)]
*  You got to defecate before you roll in there. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2010.0s)]
*  You know, you can't be saying I do to somebody at a wedding. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2016.0s)]
*  When you have it. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2023.0s)]
*  So see what God wants, baby. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2026.0s)]
*  What else? We got some great calls that came in. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2029.0s)]

*  So you see. So it's a new show for him. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2053.0s)]

*  Just hearing his words, hearing him say, hey, man, I'd be willing to get hit by a train again because it made me have some respect for my own life. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2177.0s)]
*  You know, a lot of a lot of hell, I'm wandering around in life. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2190.0s)]
*  I don't even have any respect for life a lot of times. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2194.0s)]
*  And I'm just wandering around in this bitch. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2197.0s)]

*  I don't know if I'm making any sense or not. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2240.0s)]
*  Does it make any sense, Zach? [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2242.0s)]
*  That makes sense to me. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2244.0s)]
*  I get what you're saying. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2246.0s)]

*  He's got a new lease on life and makes you have to slow down and think about it. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2249.0s)]
*  I don't know if that's what I'm saying, but thank you. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2254.0s)]
*  Oh, sorry. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2256.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2257.0s)]
*  Let's see what happened here. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2259.0s)]
*  We had a guy. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2260.0s)]
*  Some people have called in who have also been a part of miracles or who have had God kind of, you know, you know, touch their lip, you know, just whisper into their lips. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2261.0s)]
*  Because that's really that's something that's really honestly pretty gay, dude. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2273.0s)]
*  If a guy whispers into your mouth and not in your ear, bro, that is you are you are see at that point you and that man are probably dating each other. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2279.0s)]
*  It's you got to know what's going on. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2291.0s)]
*  If you're listening to another man with your mouth, bro, you already know what's good, son. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2295.0s)]
*  You got to a new little husband. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2300.0s)]
*  But anyway, a lot of people have experienced miracles. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2304.0s)]

*  I think it's I can't imagine what that would be like. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2459.0s)]
*  And even if you hear certain songs, you hear that song. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2465.0s)]
*  What is like a bomb? [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2468.0s)]
*  Like bombs over a bat, like if you hear that kind of shit, is that like actually? [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2473.0s)]
*  I bet you could if you're at like a Marine ball or whatever, you know, you fucking. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2478.0s)]
*  You just get out there and just lose your you know, you lose your fucking. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2482.0s)]
*  You just get out there and just lose your you know, [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2490.0s)]
*  just fucking pull your sword out and just I mean, you should be able to hit some. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2495.0s)]
*  I mean, if you lost your leg, I'm sure they allow you to hit somebody else or whatever. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2500.0s)]
*  If you need to. But. Unreal man or that song, boom, shake, shake, shake the room. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2504.0s)]
*  I'm trying to think if there's something that would like if something had happened to me like that, [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2512.0s)]
*  if I would get set off, you know. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2516.0s)]
*  I should have asked even Dalton if that song run away train comes on, if he, you know. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2521.0s)]
*  Wrong way on one. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2526.0s)]
*  It's just, you know, because for me, a lot of things will set me off. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2529.0s)]
*  But, dude, I think I would love to hear about it, man. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2534.0s)]
*  And and thanks for your service. And I can't imagine you're sitting there. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2537.0s)]
*  Your legs go like right past you. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2540.0s)]
*  So I'm sure your first instinct would be to try to grab your legs. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2545.0s)]
*  And, you know. Man, I can't even imagine. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2549.0s)]
*  So I guess that means I got to learn. I'd love to chat about it, bro. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2555.0s)]
*  So we'll hit you up and and see if we can have you on to for the next solo episode to to to tell us more about that experience, man. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2559.0s)]
*  And thank you for being brave enough just to call and share it. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2568.0s)]
*  You know, you know, one thing I think a lot of us have done over the years on this podcast is share things about us that make us feel uncomfortable and, you know, our shortcomings and and not even our shortcomings, but just our experiences that maybe sometimes haven't been the normal experiences for others or in some cases are. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2571.0s)]
*  But they haven't heard other people talk about it, so they don't feel OK thinking about it. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2593.0s)]
*  But, man, I'd love to hear more. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2599.0s)]
*  All right, let's get into another call here. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2605.0s)]
*  My name is Hector. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2610.0s)]
*  Love the show. Do you want to tell you a quick story and get your opinion on it? [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2612.0s)]
*  Que paso, Hector? [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2616.0s)]
*  Let's hear more. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2621.0s)]
*  I went to a family reunion recently and there's this email that I've never met. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2623.0s)]
*  I wasn't aware she was a kid until later on. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2631.0s)]
*  We ended up talking, we hit it off and everything. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2635.0s)]
*  And then we went out on a couple dates, ended up hitting it and then come to find out my mom told me she's one of my second cousins. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2638.0s)]
*  And I'm just kind of I don't know what to think about myself. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2648.0s)]
*  Kind of. I don't feel bad because I didn't know her, but I also don't want to enjoy it because she's a kid. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2653.0s)]
*  Let me know what you think about that, man. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2662.0s)]
*  Well, brother, I think this is actually a great call that some listeners can give feedback to, you know. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2665.0s)]
*  I think there's like a rule of thumb when it comes to incest, you know, and I don't know what it is, though. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2672.0s)]
*  What's the rule of thumb? [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2679.0s)]
*  Can you Google that, please? What's the rule of thumb with incest? [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2681.0s)]
*  Yeah, I can Google that. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2685.0s)]
*  Are you talking about like what's legal? Because I know some states second cousin is legal. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2689.0s)]
*  Well, I'm pretty sure that first I believe first cousin is legal. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2693.0s)]
*  No, no second cousin. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2702.0s)]
*  I mean, I think it depends on what browser you're using then, because they 24 states prohibit marriages between first cousins. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2706.0s)]
*  So I'm going to go out on a limb, you know, or is, yeah, I'm going to go out on a limb here. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2718.0s)]
*  Okay, here we go. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2728.0s)]
*  Cousin marriage legal. I'll tell you where it's legal. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2730.0s)]
*  Texas. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2734.0s)]
*  California. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2737.0s)]
*  Colorado. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2740.0s)]
*  New Mexico, Alaska, Hawaii. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2742.0s)]
*  Alabama, Tennessee, Georgia, Florida, New York. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2745.0s)]
*  Wow, that's a really cross. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2748.0s)]
*  I mean, that crosses like political lines and everything. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2750.0s)]
*  My thing is this, man. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2754.0s)]
*  Here's how you know if you shouldn't have sex with a sibling, not a sibling, but a someone who's well, first of all, you're at a family reunion, bro. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2757.0s)]
*  Maybe not a good place to even consider sex. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2767.0s)]
*  You know, I don't know if you need to, you need to wear a sign or something, a family reunion or what do you mean? [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2773.0s)]
*  Like if you walk into a family reunion, you shouldn't walk out of there with some chicks number, bro. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2778.0s)]
*  That's crazy, bro. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2786.0s)]
*  You are, I mean, you're a good guy, but you also seem like you could have some sexual predator issues. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2790.0s)]
*  You know, and I'm not judging you, but I'm just saying everybody else is going to. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2796.0s)]
*  And if you may, you can't if you like. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2802.0s)]
*  What am I what are we saying here, Zach? [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2809.0s)]
*  I mean, that was my point is if you're going to a family reunion, like what was it a mistake? [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2812.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2819.0s)]
*  I mean, how many people are at that? I didn't have a family. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2820.0s)]
*  It's a Mexican family reunion. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2822.0s)]
*  There could be a set of park. I'm sure there could be upwards of two to six thousand people there. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2824.0s)]
*  I mean, there's anybody getting off a bus in L.A. will probably stop. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2829.0s)]
*  I mean, it's I'm sure that some of the I'm sure there's a lot of vague paperwork at the reunion. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2832.0s)]
*  Is all I'm saying, which is fine. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2843.0s)]
*  Feliz Navidad, baby, you know what I'm saying? [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2846.0s)]
*  But I'm sure I understand. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2849.0s)]
*  I think how it could happen, maybe a little bit more if if there's a lot of people at the reunion. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2852.0s)]
*  And Mexican people like to hang out at the park, man. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2858.0s)]
*  That shit is no joke. Everybody knows it. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2861.0s)]
*  That's they're like a part of the culture. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2863.0s)]
*  So what does he want to know here? [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2866.0s)]
*  You think I think he's just wondering if he should feel bad about it or not. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2868.0s)]
*  OK, look, I think it's good you're reaching out to people because you don't know, you know, [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2872.0s)]
*  what some of the laws or bylaws are regarding, you know, familial sexual contact. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2877.0s)]
*  And look, I've seen people have sex that should not be having sex. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2883.0s)]
*  And I've seen the children of that. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2889.0s)]
*  And that's where God really throws his two cents in when that baby rolls out and you're like, damn, you know, [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2892.0s)]
*  this thing's got, you know, a little extra spine on it or something, you know, things got, you know, [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2899.0s)]
*  things got an extra, you know, it's got an extra thumb near his ass or whatever. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2905.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? Like, that's when you know, like, damn, [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2908.0s)]
*  but, you know, it's a little buckaroo's got four rows of teeth, you know, and two of them's on his butt hole. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2912.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? That's when you're like, oh, damn, shouldn't have done that. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2918.0s)]
*  So I think, you know, there's a general rule of thumb where I'm from. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2924.0s)]
*  You got to walk at least 300 feet point for you, pull your dick out. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2927.0s)]
*  And I think that's a good rule to keep anybody off of incest or anything like that. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2932.0s)]
*  You know, so. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2939.0s)]
*  Yeah. And they used to say also whenever you're about to pull your wiener out, [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2945.0s)]
*  say, get away from me and then name everybody in your family. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2949.0s)]
*  And so that way you would make sure you didn't have sex with somebody you shouldn't be. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2955.0s)]
*  So the second you break it out, get away from me, Timothy, get away from me. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2960.0s)]
*  And then you're like, oh, I'm going to have sex with my mom, Rhonda, Papa, Christy, you know, [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2964.0s)]
*  Emmanuel, whatever, whoever is, then that way you're setting yourself up for the best. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=2974.0s)]

*  It has to be the top of my list. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3538.0s)]
*  Okay. And who is he? [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3541.0s)]
*  I'm pulling it up for you. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3543.0s)]
*  This New York City congressional candidate, Mike Itkiss. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3546.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3551.0s)]
*  And he look right out the gate. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3552.0s)]
*  You can tell this guy came over to fuck. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3555.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3558.0s)]
*  So he didn't even bring his hair. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3559.0s)]
*  This guy's bringing, he's releasing his own sex tape to promote a sex positive approach. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3561.0s)]
*  I guess for political candidates. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3566.0s)]
*  I love it. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3568.0s)]
*  See, we got the first frame here, but I don't know. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3569.0s)]
*  Do you think it'll work out for him? [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3573.0s)]
*  Oh, I think, I mean, we're talking about it. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3575.0s)]
*  Mike Itkiss, I'd vote for this guy. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3577.0s)]
*  I love this. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3583.0s)]
*  I love him cutting. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3584.0s)]
*  Obviously, the guy has some serious. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3585.0s)]
*  He must have serious concerns that there's some video about. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3587.0s)]
*  Out there of him having sex. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3590.0s)]
*  Well, apparently it says he's focused his campaign on legalizing sex work and ending adultery laws and defining consent. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3592.0s)]
*  So he's just running a sex positive campaign. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3598.0s)]
*  Okay. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3601.0s)]
*  And look, I think I like this. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3602.0s)]
*  I think sometimes we are still abiding by old rules that don't happen anymore. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3603.0s)]
*  Pull up old laws that are outdated in some areas. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3609.0s)]
*  You know, and in the image here, the guy is bald headed. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3614.0s)]
*  He has a suit on. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3618.0s)]
*  He looks like the guy that gave the gobstopper to Charlie Wonka. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3620.0s)]
*  He looks and he's with a sex worker. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3626.0s)]
*  And look, I've we had a sex worker on here. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3632.0s)]
*  I think people, if that's where we're at, that's where we're at. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3635.0s)]
*  At a certain point, you can't fight where we're at. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3640.0s)]
*  If people are, you know, like the guy who parks the cars here, he does BMS 11 times a day. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3643.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3651.0s)]
*  I can't. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3652.0s)]
*  In fact, he has his side hustle is parking the jobs. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3654.0s)]
*  His main job is BMS in here in the bathroom. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3658.0s)]
*  The guy is just a real shit man. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3661.0s)]
*  You know, their last time I was here, I was like, oh, my God, I'm so sorry. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3666.0s)]
*  You know, in there last time I was in. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3669.0s)]
*  Yeah. And he was in there earlier when I was in there. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3671.0s)]
*  And I'll tell you what I did. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3673.0s)]
*  So I'm in there and I saw he went in behind me and I saw him. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3675.0s)]
*  He slinks in. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3679.0s)]
*  He slinks through quick. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3680.0s)]
*  You know, and he's the same stall. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3682.0s)]
*  He's one of those little same stall babies. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3684.0s)]
*  And I respect that anybody who just goes into a bathroom will just shit in any stall. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3686.0s)]
*  What? [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3692.0s)]
*  You are the serial killer of B of number two people, people doing number twos. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3694.0s)]
*  You'll just go in there and use any toilet. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3702.0s)]
*  Didn't your mother teach you anything? [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3704.0s)]
*  You just say, hey, you're like that gold, the bad little goldie like you to sleep in any bed. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3707.0s)]
*  Your little shit boy. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3713.0s)]
*  But here's what I'm saying is, what is this about? [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3716.0s)]
*  Well, we were, you know, talking about this guy. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3721.0s)]
*  All he does is shit. He doesn't work. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3723.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. The valet. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3724.0s)]
*  Slash security. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3728.0s)]
*  Security. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3731.0s)]
*  I'm not even getting into that. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3734.0s)]
*  Oh, but here's what I noticed. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3736.0s)]
*  So I'm in there. Thank you, Zach. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3737.0s)]
*  I'm in there and I see him slink pass. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3739.0s)]
*  Ready goes in there and I can tell he's sitting on the toilet and he's waiting until he thinks I'll like I've washed my hands. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3742.0s)]
*  He's waiting. He thinks I'm leaving before he does that initial burst, you know, because there's something when you go in the bathroom and you do a B.M. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3750.0s)]
*  or you do a number two, you don't want somebody here and you make that first big pop, you know, that you know, when that kind of surprise party comes out, yes, when you don't know what's going to happen. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3758.0s)]
*  So I'm in there and you know what I say, I say, you know what? [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3769.0s)]
*  I'm going to fucking pretend I leave so I can hear it. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3773.0s)]
*  And that's what I did, dude. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3778.0s)]
*  I like made like sound like this with my hands, did the water made that open the door, let it close. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3780.0s)]
*  Guy just drafts himself right into the war with his own asshole. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3792.0s)]
*  Right. I mean, just running a 50 cal bro. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3796.0s)]
*  Just parking cars all over the side of that toilet. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3800.0s)]
*  And then the second he did it, I fucking was like, and turned on all the faucets, motherfucker. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3804.0s)]
*  You don't fuck with me, dude. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3814.0s)]
*  You don't fuck with me, Whitey or whatever that guy. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3817.0s)]
*  I think he's actually Mexican. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3820.0s)]
*  He is. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3822.0s)]
*  So I'm just saying we're out here, dude. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3824.0s)]
*  And we're doing what we can. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3829.0s)]
*  What does this lady need? [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3831.0s)]
*  What I'm saying is don't have sex with your cousin, Bob. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3836.0s)]

*  Tennessee player vomits on the field against Alabama. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3850.0s)]
*  Let's see that. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3853.0s)]
*  See how this happened in the Tennessee Alabama game. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3857.0s)]
*  This guy barfed on the field and I guess use it as an intimidation tactic. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3860.0s)]
*  You can see him nod. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3864.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3865.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3866.0s)]

*  A lot of where is that? [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3870.0s)]

*  Norway. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3878.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3879.0s)]
*  Cold areas. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3880.0s)]
*  A lot of that vomit. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3881.0s)]
*  It was a look what I'm going to do to you. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3882.0s)]
*  I'm a digest you. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3884.0s)]
*  Also, this is Tennessee. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3886.0s)]
*  Somebody could have just ordered a beer up in the stands and that dude was trying to [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3887.0s)]
*  I mean, that's draft. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3890.0s)]
*  I mean, that is Bush light for sure. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3892.0s)]
*  But hey, baby, go big orange, bro. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3896.0s)]
*  I will say that. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3899.0s)]
*  And there was a game a lot filled with a lot of calls, but at the end, nobody was really [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3900.0s)]
*  playing defense. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3904.0s)]
*  And they won. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3905.0s)]
*  And they won. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3909.0s)]
*  What else we have? [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3911.0s)]
*  Any other good news that came in? [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3912.0s)]
*  We got a billion snow crabs missing in Alaska. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3915.0s)]
*  We got and this is what I want to talk about the supply chain. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3919.0s)]
*  Everybody thinks that we don't have certain things because China is not making it. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3923.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3928.0s)]
*  Who's the original China? [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3930.0s)]
*  Mother Nature, baby. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3932.0s)]
*  M F in Mother F in nature. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3935.0s)]
*  The original China. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3943.0s)]
*  The crabs are missing. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3946.0s)]
*  What do they say? [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3948.0s)]
*  So they're estimating about a billion snow crabs are missing from Alaska. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3949.0s)]
*  And that's a big deal for their economy. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3956.0s)]
*  Obviously, I know that people think of like Deadliest Catch Show, but they can't find the [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3958.0s)]
*  snow crabs in the first time in history. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3963.0s)]
*  They got to cancel the season. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3964.0s)]
*  So the question is, you know, they're potentially blaming this on climate change to say the [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3965.0s)]
*  ice is melting. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3970.0s)]
*  They need the ice. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3971.0s)]
*  But I'm wondering if someone stole it. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3972.0s)]
*  Yeah, you can get ice anywhere. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3974.0s)]
*  First of all, I'm gonna go put that on record. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3976.0s)]
*  Second of all, I'm going to say this. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3978.0s)]
*  Mother Nature will change the menu, guys. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3980.0s)]
*  That's one thing people don't think. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3983.0s)]
*  You don't you think. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3985.0s)]
*  Dude, two million years ago, people were having dinosaur meat, a little bit of dactyl, huh? [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=3986.0s)]

*  I'm sure you got an ad the next moment for NFTs. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=4182.0s)]
*  For, you know, Van Gogh or whatever, Lombardi, De Numa, whatever. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=4186.0s)]

*  Do not forget it. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=4239.0s)]
*  We are not alone. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=4242.0s)]
*  We have each other. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=4244.0s)]
*  It was it was awesome to see a lot of you guys out on the road. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=4246.0s)]
*  I look forward to seeing you again down the line. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=4249.0s)]
*  And I love you. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=4253.0s)]
*  And I hope you take care of yourselves and and keep some joy in your in your in your headspace. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=4255.0s)]
*  You know, get some anger out of your life. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=4265.0s)]
*  You know what? [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=4267.0s)]
*  Actually, we had a call that came in. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=4268.0s)]
*  I forgot the guy had asked about anger and we never got an answer to him. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=4269.0s)]
*  And then this call came in and I just wanted to hear this because I needed to hear this as well when I listen to this. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=4273.0s)]
*  Yo, this is Travis from Portland, Oregon. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=4283.0s)]
*  What's up, Travis? [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=4288.0s)]
*  I think I'm going to go back to the dude who is calling in about struggling with anger issues. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=4290.0s)]
*  And that's something that I really resonate with or, you know, have dealt with in my lifetime. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=4296.0s)]
*  And I think one thing that's important, like everything that you said, I totally, totally agree with. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=4303.0s)]
*  Like a lot of it's just like you want to control outcomes. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=4310.0s)]
*  And when things aren't going your way, you get angry, just like a little child. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=4314.0s)]
*  I think sometimes that that little child inside of you just needs more love and like, you know, so something that's really helped me is like when when I've been angry and upset and frustrated or whatever, just like learning to talk to myself differently. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=4318.0s)]
*  Because if you're angry with being angry, it really doesn't really get you anywhere. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=4335.0s)]
*  And so, yeah, just learning how to like, kind of just, you know, talk to my, the part of me that's angry like it is my child in like a loving manner and just like, you know, just be that mature adult, you know, for myself in those situations and scenarios. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=4342.0s)]
*  You know, it's kind of hard to have that that a purview at that time when you're kind of in the in the heat or whatever. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=4363.0s)]
*  Yeah, man. That's a great. That's a great suggestion because I find that I find when I'm angry. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=4372.0s)]
*  That's what I feel like a child. It's like a child, you know, and those are the, you know, I'm still have a door. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=4377.0s)]
*  I still have a door. Even as an adult, I still have those behaviors as a child. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=4385.0s)]
*  And it's hard, you know, but that's a great that's a great suggestion to really take yourself aside and almost talk to yourself like you would a child, you know, say, hey, what's going on here? [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=4389.0s)]
*  You know, why are you what's happening? What's really happening? Because you're not that upset about this. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=4400.0s)]
*  What's really going on? [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=4406.0s)]
*  Yeah, I love that man. And that just helps you build a better relationship with yourself. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=4410.0s)]
*  And that was a great suggestion. So thank you. And if the young man that called in about the anger issues got to hear that, then that's that's perfect. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=4416.0s)]
*  That's what we're here for. If you have an issue, something that's straining you something you're struggling with, hit the hotline. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=4425.0s)]
*  Hotline 985-664-9503. We're going to head out the way that we came in. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=4430.0s)]
*  I'm hoping to go see some Zach Brian music tomorrow night. Looking forward to that. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=4438.0s)]
*  And then I'm hoping to be at the LSU Ole Miss game this weekend. That's going to be a big one. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=4444.0s)]
*  That's going to be a big one. This is Eddie Ninevolt with Little Black Flies. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=4452.0s)]
*  I love this jam. You guys be good to yourself and you deserve it. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=4459.0s)]
*  The water gets too rough, you know who to call. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb40sDiqyhs&t=4489.0s)]
