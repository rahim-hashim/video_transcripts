*  Chinese person, you know talk about it in a Vietnamese person [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=150.73999999999998s)]

*  When I was a kid, they just built giant vert ramps and put him in a fucking park in here [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=191.86s)]

*  There was a time I have to sell my ramp for scraps [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=206.74s)]
*  It wouldn't be crazy. We walk up on him in winter and he's like making firewood out of his last ramp, you know [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=210.66s)]

*  somewhat greener pastures and started being the voice of the channel we were on for the most part and then I kept doing the podcast and then [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=315.06s)]
*  I was just kind of getting buried in there [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=321.86s)]
*  Well, what do you think you were missing like when he wasn't there was there something you felt like you were missing? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=324.98s)]
*  um [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=329.46000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, definitely a a a edgier comedy. I would say yes, which wasn't good at the time [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=331.14s)]
*  It was it was pretty raw and we I had a lot of I had a lot of kids listening because it was oh, yeah [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=337.7s)]
*  It was very much [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=343.94s)]
*  Still skating and we were doing video games and they wanted to hear about that and play music and then this guy would bring in him [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=345.78s)]
*  Yeah, that's a crazy episode [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=351.53999999999996s)]
*  I mean pretty much [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=354.97999999999996s)]
*  Like the work release uncle, yeah, very unfiltered but it was hilarious [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=357.29999999999995s)]
*  um, but then um [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=361.53999999999996s)]
*  But then like I said, we just they just kind of fizzled out [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=363.46s)]
*  And then he started podcasting and and I hit him up [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=366.5s)]
*  I said maybe we should try something and so we started trying it and it kind of clicked and it's been fun [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=369.06s)]
*  Yeah, it feels fun. It feels fun to watch you guys. I trying to think when I when I watch I feel like [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=374.18s)]
*  um [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=379.94s)]
*  Yeah, I feel like you guys have a comfort level with each other [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=381.54s)]
*  There's a real earnestness that comes out of you a lot that I think creates this it makes you kind of be the same way [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=384.1s)]
*  I don't know. I haven't watched a ton but from what i've seen it's uh, it seems like [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=389.46000000000004s)]
*  Like a new little not like a marriage but like a new little like, okay [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=393.86s)]
*  No, it's good. It's springtime at the house. You know, you gave me a key to the ramp the other day and I [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=397.94s)]
*  I thought it was as just as good as an engagement ring to me [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=402.5s)]
*  I think it's pretty special what's happening for sure to a skate ramp to my ramp [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=406.26s)]
*  Okay, so yeah, is it like you said only rich guys have their own ramps? Yeah [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=410.82s)]
*  Yeah, it's a total rich guy ramp and it also has a lockout front of it that definitely it's in a warehouse [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=414.5s)]
*  Oh it is although someone broke in the other night stole some camera gear [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=419.22s)]
*  Oh, I thought they just skated no skating. I know I was kind of hoping that too. Hey, what are you doing? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=423.14000000000004s)]
*  Well, you gave Alice a key. You didn't give me one [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=428.66s)]
*  Somebody broke somebody broke in here too. Actually what they stole cameras. Yeah [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=431.14000000000004s)]
*  Oh, yeah, it must be that time of year. Maybe the holidays people are looking, you know to give cameras out or something [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=436.26000000000005s)]
*  Well, they they were going around the building trying to get into different doors and finally got into [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=441.54s)]
*  The door that just happened to be [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=446.66s)]
*  By a camera that was set up. Oh, yeah, that's a game show for criminals [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=448.82s)]
*  I feel like they just walk into a building and it's like done [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=451.86s)]
*  Yeah, if he had gotten the other door opened he would have had [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=455.94s)]
*  uh [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=459.78000000000003s)]
*  A piece of the of the loop [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=461.06s)]
*  Oh [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=463.54s)]
*  The loop the loop ramp is all set up over there [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=464.66s)]
*  That would have been hard. That would have been hard to steal on a whim [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=467.54s)]
*  I was gonna say and what would you do like if Theo stole the loop? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=469.78000000000003s)]

*  We had to build an extension on the starting ramp for him. Look at it. Is that it the actual thing? Yeah [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=584.18s)]

*  In your background when you get to the upside down part [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=613.7s)]
*  You want to look back because that's what you usually do you're going back usually turning around. Oh, yeah [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=617.7s)]

*  We had uh [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=726.66s)]
*  I'm trying to think if we had a lot of skateboarding area. We had one dude jumped off the shownies one time on a board [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=728.1800000000001s)]
*  and uh [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=733.7s)]
*  Hit what's a shoni? It's a shoni. It's like a place where you get food. It's like a denny's [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=734.98s)]
*  Yeah, it's like a denny's but off the roof. Yeah, he came down off the roof [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=740.02s)]
*  Yeah, but he hit a buick all a saber [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=743.3s)]
*  And can you pull up all the saber daddy? Wait while it was moving? No, no, no still the saber [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=745.86s)]
*  Yeah, wait, he didn't see not eating properly. I think he didn't plan ahead really [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=750.82s)]
*  Yeah, I think some people think when you're going off a roof you're going to be able to jump [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=754.66s)]
*  But I think the angle you're at. Oh, I see. He just went straight down eliminates that he had a maroon one, too [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=757.94s)]
*  All right. That's a good look [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=762.9s)]
*  Yeah, not a bad I mean it was a cool but anyway, yeah [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=764.82s)]
*  He like shattered his neck or whatever which I didn't think he could shatter like your neck's already [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=768.02s)]
*  Kind of in like different pieces. I feel like so it's like to shut you know [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=772.02s)]
*  But they said he shattered his neck but he wore a neck brace forever after that. It's an interesting theory on your neck [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=774.82s)]
*  Unshatterable that they either they don't shatter because there's pieces in there [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=780.48s)]
*  That's an interesting theory. Oh, yeah, that's all i'm saying. They're already perforated. Yeah [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=784.9s)]
*  I mean we're not doctors on this side of the table, but what the fuck? [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=789.38s)]
*  You can shatter you can shatter pretty much anything [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=793.46s)]
*  It doesn't seem like [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=798.02s)]
*  Shattering seems like like a hard word to use for the neck, but [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=801.44s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. What's the what's what is something that most people what's the first thing most people break doing skateboarding? [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=805.38s)]

*  I think I would have really if I could have really focused on it [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=1522.54s)]
*  It seems like it takes a lot of real focus in a strange way [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=1525.82s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. What's the best element to be a skateboarder? Like what is the thing? [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=1529.74s)]
*  I've never given up really because you got to do it over and over again. Sometimes it seems impossible [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=1533.74s)]
*  But if you go enough all of a sudden you can but there's so many different elements too that that you could be good at [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=1540.1399999999999s)]
*  So you can kind of focus in on well, i'm really good at doing these types of flip tricks [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=1546.2199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, and and getting them into grinds and stuff and that can just be your whole brand [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=1551.4199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, and then other people are like they just fly they fly out of our ramps [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=1556.78s)]
*  And that's their thing and everyone loves to see them fly and that's good enough, right? [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=1561.1000000000001s)]
*  Um, some people have a little bit of all of it [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=1566.46s)]
*  But then some are like high like, you know, if you look at nijah houston just precision technical [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=1568.3s)]

*  Yeah [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=1583.98s)]
*  Sometimes you see people like that that start to change the way that things are done like patrick mahomes kind of changes [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=1584.3s)]
*  The quarterback position like oh, I didn't think that this could even be played differently. Yeah, and then it seems like he just plays the game [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=1589.1799999999998s)]
*  differently or at a speed [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=1596.4599999999998s)]

*  But skating a mini ramp and skating his ramp is two different things two different animals [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=1840.62s)]
*  And we're talking chit chatting i'm skating and I guess he's on the deck and i'm like if you're on the deck you can skate [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=1845.6599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, there's you don't get the deck the top of the ramp. Yeah. Yeah, so he's up there hanging out [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=1851.82s)]
*  And then I guess he dropped in and I didn't I wasn't watching I figured everybody could drop in no big deal [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=1856.78s)]
*  So I see out of the corner my heart right when he drops in [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=1861.6599999999999s)]

*  Superstitions are a way of controlling things [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2187.48s)]
*  Uh in the periphery of uncontrollable situations. I don't know if that's true. I made that up on the spot. Okay [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2189.98s)]

*  In the 80s, there was a girl that paid the front desk to tell her which room I was in so that she could get a room [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2302.14s)]
*  next to mine nice [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2308.94s)]
*  and then [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2311.3399999999997s)]
*  And then what but uh, nothing happened [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2312.54s)]
*  She did knock on my door one time and then [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2315.5s)]
*  Like it was sometime through the weekend [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2318.22s)]
*  She knocked on my door and then she did come in for a little bit nothing nothing happened [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2319.66s)]
*  But all of a sudden this slamming on the door came [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2323.18s)]
*  And I guess it was her boyfriend. Oh that guy that knew the whole [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2327.4199999999996s)]
*  Scoop of what she was up to [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2331.2599999999998s)]
*  I'm just i'm just like I I didn't even know that this girl had already done this. I found this out later [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2333.5s)]
*  right and then [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2338.14s)]
*  the next day [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2339.8999999999996s)]
*  Uh, i'm getting the elevator and the dude I didn't know it was him because I hadn't seen him and y'all got in the elevator [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2341.74s)]
*  He gets in the elevator and he looks at me and he's got a cast on [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2347.3399999999997s)]
*  And why would happen to me and he's like sorry about slamming on your door last night broke my wrist. Oh [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2350.7s)]

*  Well, I guess he was drunk at the time. Sorry for that guy. That was that was an odd one [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2361.5s)]
*  Yeah, I was just sort of okay then I feel like they would yeah what you got you got [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2365.5s)]
*  I kind of had that then yeah, because girls will try and sleep with me and usually they just can and it's [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2369.2599999999998s)]
*  But one time at a alice mania that had this fight called the strip fight where uh, [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2376.3799999999997s)]
*  Every 30 seconds we decide who won the 30 seconds [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2381.74s)]
*  And uh the the person that loses takes an item of clothes up clothing off until they're down to a g-string and pasties [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2385.18s)]
*  So I just go regardless. I go you lost you lost you lost you lost [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2392.22s)]
*  Right now you're both naked fight [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2397.4199999999996s)]
*  So then they fight and that's kind of the thing [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2400.54s)]
*  So one of the people you know dm me that they're that I get fighters. You're not allowed to know how to fight [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2402.46s)]

*  I'll hook you up in a fight where you get a real fight, but you're not going to get really hurt [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2412.94s)]
*  Okay, joe rogan might disagree, but it's a couple of shots [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2417.26s)]
*  And if you look like you're in trouble, we just call it. We don't let you like bleed really cook out [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2420.94s)]

*  She's got a what I assume is a boyfriend, but it's like, uh, everyone has this, uh, you're allowed to bring a coach [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2433.02s)]
*  Or whatever or or just a plus one so you got a man over there helping out a little leader [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2440.38s)]
*  Yeah [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2444.54s)]
*  So there's an after party and I got this big room with all this bullshit at the hard rock [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2444.94s)]
*  And she's hanging out and she's asking if she can sleep with me [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2449.7400000000002s)]

*  She gets just my coach [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2466.7799999999997s)]
*  And I go, oh well then okay, no problem. And then I and then she's hanging out and I look at him and i'm like he is [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2468.7s)]
*  Obviously bummed. Oh, and I go hey man. What's what's going on? You're right over there. He's like, you know, she's just you know [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2474.54s)]
*  Been going out with the with each other for like some amount of years and i'm like what we broke up [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2481.66s)]
*  I'm like, but you're i'm like i'm so out of this you guys need to spend time together [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2487.3399999999997s)]
*  Go get him a little gift certificate or something. I can't play that game. But yeah every now and then somebody just tries brain check [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2492.14s)]
*  Yeah, get him. Well, I have to feel like stalk [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2498.22s)]
*  Because some of my friends always get stalkers and i'm like damn I can't get [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2501.1s)]
*  I think stalkers is more of a sex thing. If you're good if you do good sex [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2504.7s)]
*  Then I think you get a stalker, you know, you mean somebody you've already had sex with and it was so good that they just keep [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2508.86s)]
*  I feel like that's the only way it would make sense [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2515.2599999999998s)]
*  Like if you kind of are okay at sex, I don't think anybody's you know, smashing through your windows to get back [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2517.42s)]
*  I thought stalkers you'd never met [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2525.26s)]
*  a little more [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2527.58s)]
*  Mentally unstable and it's not but something has to spark that stalk. You got to you got to light that up [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2529.26s)]
*  A lot of times they think that whatever whatever art you're doing whatever whatever content you're creating is speaking directly to them [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2535.42s)]
*  I mean that that seems like the more scary stalker not [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2543.02s)]
*  Hey, I like you and i'm trying to get to you [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2547.18s)]
*  I I well, I guess I had a girl who left her vax card on my window [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2549.9s)]
*  And she wrote check me for covid on there charlotte was her name [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2554.06s)]
*  But I never had anybody like my friends get the girls they're jumping over the fence or yelling [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2558.62s)]
*  They're throwing stuff through the windows. They're showing up at their like you're talking about groupies not stalkers [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2562.7799999999997s)]
*  I don't know. These are the ones they've had to call the cops [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2567.58s)]
*  Wow [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2570.46s)]
*  Not stalkers. Yeah, so really [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2571.58s)]
*  But I think they got to be sexually motivated [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2573.98s)]
*  I don't think anybody's fucking smashing through your living room window to fucking come watch an episode of uh, [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2575.9s)]
*  Dexter new blood or something, you know what i'm saying? Like I think you gotta have like a real [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2581.5s)]

*  Because now I feel like any guy that's like a super fan [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2590.62s)]
*  Kind of wants to have sex with me. It's getting to that point [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2593.8199999999997s)]
*  It feels like a lot of oh some fans would let you would let you have sex with their males even [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2596.7s)]
*  Who's do you think somebody's super famous like a guy because I always said if let's say if I wasn't uh, [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2601.3399999999997s)]

*  you know someone who's growing up around with a family with a lot of addiction, you know, I I uh [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2668.14s)]
*  I was curious because you're now very open about your sexuality at this point [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2672.54s)]
*  And i've always wondered, you know [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2676.14s)]
*  Do you think that that that drugs were more of an opportunity for you to unlock something that was always inside of you? [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2677.18s)]
*  Or do you feel like you know kind of the extremes of your sexuality have been [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2683.1s)]
*  Part of lusting after a different high [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2687.5s)]
*  And without drugs, do you think that you'd be the same person that that you are sober now today? [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2691.02s)]
*  Or do you think that was always kind of a part of you? [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2695.3399999999997s)]
*  um [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2697.98s)]
*  And that's a lot right? Let's just answer the first one. Yeah [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2699.3399999999997s)]
*  um [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2703.74s)]
*  I don't think i'm bi because I did do drugs. I think I think I definitely did when I did drugs that helped me [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2705.66s)]
*  uh [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2713.42s)]
*  Do things that I was scared to do for sure when it came to that you think there's a man because a lot of drug [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2714.22s)]
*  Drug induced homosexuality in my area. Yeah, that's what I thought I was because I did so many drugs. I was like you just [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2720.22s)]
*  You're not gay. You just like did like eight molly pills and you'll let anybody blow you that doesn't make you gay. Yeah. Yeah [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2726.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, because a lot of you see a lot of gay men meet up behind the rest area in our town and they would do drugs and then [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2733.74s)]
*  Get involved in the sexual activity behind the rest area and people would actually shoot these potato guns at them they had like, uh [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2740.06s)]
*  Because there was a river there was a river right there and these two guys across the river would you know? [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2748.06s)]
*  Not if they were not doesn't sound like the spot to go to like just to break them up [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2752.78s)]
*  Yeah, it was like a warning shot. Yeah, it was all warning shots [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2756.78s)]
*  But um, it was like yeah, because I guess they were just alarmed if there was like drug induced homosexuality [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2759.5s)]
*  That's what I think people were alarmed at. I mean people potty man [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2765.34s)]
*  But yeah, that's what maybe they're just trying to be uninhibited. Maybe I was gonna say just trying to [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2769.02s)]
*  You know get away from their inhibitions and just like oh straight people when they get really high [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2775.5s)]
*  Yeah, that was a different time when that was going on [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2780.38s)]
*  But now yeah, I think like yeah, because drugs will just make you a little more brave [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2782.46s)]
*  I think almost to do anything sometimes and especially if you're really clowned out dude, you'll fucking [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2786.3s)]
*  And it was trying to eat your own ass my uncle [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2791.5s)]

*  And when we we'd fucking be gone for like 40 minutes, dude trying to look at our own ass [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2798.7799999999997s)]
*  You know, it's a weird thing [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2803.8999999999996s)]
*  I remember the first time I shaved my ass and was like trying to find my hole in the mirror and I was like [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2804.94s)]
*  I was like wow, I feel slightly like less confident in myself by looking at myself from this angle [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2809.8199999999997s)]
*  Oh, yeah, but eventually you get you know, because that's it. That's your ass. You better live with it, you know [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2816.7799999999997s)]
*  Staring in the ass. I think it does weaken you [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2821.74s)]
*  Yeah, see I see I think it I think it does at first right but for me because at first I felt the same thing [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=2824.22s)]

*  but well [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=3900.56s)]
*  After I did 900 at the x games then a few other people learned it. Um within the same year and then uh, [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=3901.7599999999998s)]
*  Tom char did a 1080 [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=3909.92s)]
*  About 10 years later. Did it hurt your feelings when he did it? [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=3912.72s)]
*  No [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=3916.24s)]
*  I was so that guy [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=3917.2s)]
*  Yeah, I was like god and there was no way I was ever gonna try that [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=3918.88s)]
*  I what I went through with 900s and even after I made it and some of the slams I took [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=3922.4s)]
*  After I could do it [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=3928.08s)]
*  Knowing that i'd have to try to spin another rotation. No [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=3930.0s)]
*  um, and then uh, let's see [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=3933.6800000000003s)]
*  1080 then mitchie bruska did a 1080 [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=3936.0s)]
*  Then mitchie bruska went on to do a 1260. So that is [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=3938.64s)]
*  That is the record. No one has done a 1260 [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=3942.56s)]
*  Mega, right mega three and a half spins in the air on the mega ramp too. You know what that is? [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=3947.04s)]
*  No, it's like a 30 foot quarter pipe twice as big as a vote ramp. Yeah [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=3952.0s)]
*  So you get more air time 18 feet high enough man enough is enough enough. Yeah, but you didn't say [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=3956.32s)]
*  But but also that that thing sometimes comes back to bite me was saying it was a good greatest day of my life [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=3962.7200000000003s)]
*  I was I was overcome with emotion. It's supposed to be when your kids are born, right? Yeah. Well also my [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=3968.4s)]
*  My uh, my wife at the time and our newborn was right there [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=3975.44s)]
*  That didn't I wasn't a good let him live man. The 900 was a really bad deal [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=3979.52s)]
*  But also there there was I tried to defend it which was not a good idea, too [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=3983.84s)]
*  um [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=3988.2400000000002s)]
*  I meant to say it's the greatest day of my career [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=3989.2000000000003s)]
*  The greatest day of my skating career, but also there was a part of me that was like well, you know what? [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=3991.76s)]
*  I've been trying 900s for about 10 years [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=3996.0s)]
*  I haven't been trying to have kids for 10 years [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=3999.44s)]
*  You know what I mean? Yeah, that's a good call man. It was one of the greatest days for skateboarding's life [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=4002.56s)]
*  Like that's how big of a deal it was. Well, I heard about it and I didn't know anything about skateboarding [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=4007.92s)]
*  Right, you know I could tell believe in it. I could tell when he did it that people that didn't skate were like [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=4011.44s)]
*  This is a big deal. Yeah, usually it's just us that care, you know, right? Yeah [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=4015.92s)]
*  I mean when I learned 720s it was in 1985 on a backyard ramp in Stockholm, Sweden [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=4020.56s)]
*  There were two people there. Mm. No one cared. Yeah, you know, I was like, oh that was cool new spin [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=4027.04s)]
*  Yeah, but then that shit flew around the world [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=4033.6s)]
*  And you know because it was no internet, but I heard you did that [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=4036.32s)]
*  Yeah, but you were you were you were also [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=4039.6s)]
*  In the community and it's a very small community of skateboarding but that one because it was on ESPN and because they showed it live [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=4043.12s)]
*  Um, it just kind of went viral when also yeah [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=4050.4s)]
*  I mean the video game too when that popped me it was like that video game was almost like [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=4053.2000000000003s)]
*  It was almost like a tick tock video now like everybody can make a video game in 30 seconds on their phone [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=4057.2000000000003s)]
*  You know, it's like but back then there was only a few videos that got there was like [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=4061.6s)]
*  you know, so a video game was almost just like a [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=4066.0s)]
*  YouTube video now in a way, you know, it was like a way to see something different, you know [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=4068.96s)]
*  There wasn't that many there was television movie or video game. There wasn't anything else [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=4073.76s)]
*  It's like the hip hop era the the the gold [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=4078.88s)]
*  What is it the gold era where it's like if you're a hip hop if you're a big hip hop artist in the late 80s 90s [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=4082.5600000000004s)]
*  Then you're still [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=4088.88s)]
*  A hip hop artist today. It's very hard to be from another generation and still be solid [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=4091.04s)]
*  Right, he could with the video game [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=4097.44s)]
*  It's a video game that's because there's games that were invented 10 years ago that my kid plays now. It's got respect [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=4099.599999999999s)]
*  but [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=4106.08s)]
*  there's not many of those it's always like ever changing tony hawks video game seems like [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=4106.88s)]
*  My kid doesn't he knows what's cool. That's usually the first thing people say to me now who? [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=4112.24s)]
*  Grew up, you know knowing my name or or or recognize me if someone recognized me that happened today [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=4118.88s)]
*  Say oh what's up, Tony? I'm gonna [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=4125.12s)]
*  video games that happened the parking lot actually I uh [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=4127.28s)]
*  Just I went to a restaurant before I got here and when I got in my car this dude like jumped out of his car [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=4130.4800000000005s)]
*  Stopped his car jumped out. He's like yo, man [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=4135.360000000001s)]
*  And then he saw my skateboard like this. He saw my skateboard in the trunk [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=4138.24s)]
*  Yeah, he's like he's like let me get a clip do a trick [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=4140.96s)]
*  And so I grabbed the skateboard and went down to the parking garage [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=4144.24s)]
*  I did I did because I was going to the restaurant and I was gonna skate there anyway [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=4146.4800000000005s)]
*  But I was just like yeah, catch me as i'm leaving [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=4150.16s)]
*  Um, what a guy do uh [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=4153.12s)]
*  Was there any product you guys ever push that was kind of crazy like was ever a product that got presented to you guys [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=4156.96s)]
*  that was like kind of bananas like uh [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=4161.44s)]
*  That you guys ever did we sell out are you saying like kid rock? [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=4164.5599999999995s)]
*  Kid rock tells a story about like he got involved with this company called badass beer, right? [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=4168.4s)]
*  And so he like made like a meal like and i'm paraphrasing his own beer, right? [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=4173.92s)]
*  And I think it's what it was it was his own beer, right? [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=4178.16s)]
*  But the second batch of it was fucking horrible. They just cooked it too long or something [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=4180.0s)]
*  But they still put it out, right? [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=4184.64s)]
*  Which was that was not the best move. I don't think but so it just cannibalized the whole thing [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=4186.72s)]
*  Everybody's like this fucking beer is is is is shit, you know, so um [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=4191.04s)]
*  I worked with a company that that I didn't realize it was in the 80s that I didn't realize I had signed away [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=4196.96s)]
*  My rights to them [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=4203.2s)]
*  And I had no idea what that meant I was I was whatever 19 or something and [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=4204.88s)]
*  And uh, they just started making products with my name on it [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=4209.04s)]
*  And then I finally came to them like you guys this sucks. You can't do this. They're like actually we can yeah [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=4211.52s)]
*  You know, it was more it was more like it's like a cooking robe [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=4217.76s)]
*  It was uh [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=4221.04s)]
*  It was a velcro wallet, which was fine [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=4222.8s)]
*  With um, basically they stole the vision streetwear logo and it just said tony hawk gear. They ripped off two people [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=4226.32s)]
*  Yeah, and I just said you guys this is vision streetwear. Yeah, they're like, yeah [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=4232.799999999999s)]

*  And the reason it happened was because they were talking about doing some sort of unique promotion [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=4833.839999999999s)]
*  And they presented that idea to me [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=4838.64s)]
*  And I grew up a fan of kiss in the 70s. Oh, yeah [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qy4RCNBfP8&t=4841.84s)]
