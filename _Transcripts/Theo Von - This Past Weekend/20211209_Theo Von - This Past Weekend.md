*  The book man. I've read as much as I can and listened to as much as I can so far just because it's a lot of information [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=128.12s)]
*  You know, especially um [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=135.32s)]
*  Information probably isn't probably my top strong suit, but I think it's getting better. But um [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=137.8s)]
*  What was like the research process like for putting together a book like this? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=142.96s)]
*  I'm a [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=149.08s)]
*  Lot of it was just like reading my emails because I have a list of [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=152.28s)]
*  with [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=158.52s)]
*  almost [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=160.04s)]
*  300 doctors and pH MDs and PhD scientists on it and so a lot of the [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=161.16s)]
*  a [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=170.36s)]
*  Lot of the kind of the current science [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=172.2s)]
*  Wait, if there's a new study that comes out in the Lancet or jam or any of those [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=175.72s)]
*  4000 journals that are out there. I see it almost immediately. Okay, and then I see it discussed [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=181.32s)]
*  By people who are highly critical and know how to [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=189.56s)]
*  read science critically [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=193.16s)]
*  so I can see them arguing with each other and [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=195.64s)]
*  Criticizing the study and finding its weaknesses and all that kind of stuff and it allows me to kind of make better [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=199.88s)]
*  evaluations of it, but you know, I've known Fauci for a long time. Okay, and I [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=206.35999999999999s)]
*  And I also have a peculiar insight [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=213.64s)]
*  Into the phenomena of agency capture and that is the dynamic by which [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=218.64s)]
*  environmental agencies and public health agencies [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=224.92s)]
*  Become sock puppets of the industries. They're supposed to regulate it happens with every agency [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=229.16s)]
*  So I was in everything it happens with all of them whether it's yes, he see you or the FDA or you know [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=234.64s)]
*  a CC yeah any of the three letter agencies ultimately [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=242.35999999999999s)]
*  Over time the industry figures out how to infiltrate them how to control the senators and the congressmen that write their budgets [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=248.27999999999997s)]
*  How to get control that agency because it's so [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=256.72s)]
*  important for their profit ambitions, right and so I [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=260.6s)]
*  Probably brought over 500 lawsuits as an environmental lawyer [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=265.52000000000004s)]
*  Mainly against polluters who are discharging into the environment into the air or whatever [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=271.20000000000005s)]
*  But probably during the 38 years that I was doing that [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=276.92s)]
*  Probably 20% of my lawsuits were against EPA or the state environmental agencies or [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=281.96s)]
*  Issuing these kind of sweetheart [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=290.88s)]
*  Illegal permits because they get compromised also you're saying as they get compromised so I was used to that dynamic, right? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=293.32s)]
*  Hard to navigate of seeing the agency that's supposed to be my friend, but it's actually my enemy, you know on these [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=300.68s)]
*  environmental issues. Oh [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=308.15999999999997s)]
*  I was accustomed to that [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=310.0s)]
*  That dynamic is particularly acute. It's really on steroids in public health agencies because there are these [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=312.36s)]
*  unprecedented entanglements financial entanglements, for example [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=320.88s)]
*  FDA gets [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=325.88s)]
*  45% of its annual budget from pharmaceutical companies. Oh, they're really you know, there's really no it's kind of a seamless [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=327.96s)]
*  subsidiary of the industry and it's really [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=336.4s)]
*  It's agency capture on steroids. So the FDA is funded mostly by [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=340.08s)]
*  pharmaceutical companies about a half of their money comes from pharmaceutical companies and that's because [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=345.84s)]
*  We passed a law in the [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=352.56s)]
*  in the 90s at [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=355.72s)]
*  Actually in the in the early 2000s that allows it's called fast track approval [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=358.84s)]
*  So the drug companies were complaining that you know, these drugs take 10 years to get approved [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=363.96s)]
*  And a lot of the particularly the Republicans on Capitol Hill who want the agencies to be more industry friendly [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=369.71999999999997s)]
*  They said there ought to be a process with the with the industry can come in and pay [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=378.11999999999995s)]
*  to get a very very quick approval and [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=384.12s)]
*  So now that seems dirty busy. It is dirty busy. It's there's a kind of a rational reason for it [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=388.23999999999995s)]
*  Is the agency would said? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=395.2s)]
*  We simply don't have enough [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=397.36s)]
*  personnel [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=399.64s)]
*  to quickly process these applications [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=400.71999999999997s)]
*  so Congress said [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=403.88s)]
*  Okay. Well, we're gonna get the industry to give you the money to hire the people to process it [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=406.08s)]
*  But really what happens is the agency is now being paid to do its job by the industry and they become partners [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=411.92s)]
*  And they're no longer a [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=419.32s)]
*  Regulatory agency they're really you know, they're their regulatory mission gets [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=422.04s)]
*  subsumed by these commercial and mercantile, you know for business big business [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=428.52s)]
*  Yeah, that's big business and like I said, it happens in every aspect [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=434.04s)]
*  Yeah, and you know what's advertising and everything comes into anything it gets it gets a little bit polluted. Yeah, and with the COVID, you know [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=437.15999999999997s)]
*  crisis [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=445.36s)]
*  It's from the beginning it really [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=447.52s)]
*  The the response to the public health agencies [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=450.0s)]
*  Was not a public health response. It was a mercantile response [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=455.44s)]
*  It was how do we get money to these vaccine companies? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=460.16s)]
*  It wasn't how do we save lives and particularly with our country and that's why you know our country [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=464.44s)]
*  We have the worst track record. So we have a high with what well [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=470.68s)]
*  We have four point two percent of the world's population [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=475.72s)]
*  But we had twenty percent of the COVID deaths and that's all on Anthony Fauci [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=478.44s)]
*  the mismanagement that took place [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=483.72s)]
*  He basically got rid of early treatment. Oh [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=486.76s)]
*  Eighty percent of the people who went to hospitals should never go into a hospital. It felt like that [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=490.12s)]
*  This is a regular person [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=494.88s)]
*  It felt like something's stranger that all these people just hooked up to this thing they're being hooked up to machines [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=495.88s)]
*  If you went to let's say if you went to your doctor. Yeah [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=501.12s)]
*  And you and you have maybe a headache or you lost your sense of taste [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=504.84000000000003s)]
*  It's an early symptom. It's not debilitating [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=510.44s)]
*  And he gives you a PCR test and the PCR test say you have covered [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=513.8s)]
*  What does that doctor now do? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=520.24s)]
*  Here's what he does under Tony Fauci's regimen. He tells you go home [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=522.6s)]
*  Do you're so sick that your lips turn blue because she can't breathe and go to the hospital and we're gonna put you on a ventilator [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=527.0s)]
*  Which is gonna probably kill you right and we're gonna give you remdesivir [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=534.8399999999999s)]
*  Which is gonna probably kill you but did they know in the beginning that that they because it felt like [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=539.12s)]
*  It felt like they didn't know like no one knew how [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=546.64s)]
*  Severe it was so at first maybe they don't know what to do the doc. Well, the thing is [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=550.0799999999999s)]
*  At the very beginning you can say that [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=555.1999999999999s)]
*  but by April they knew that at hydroxychloroquine worked right and they actually knew much earlier because [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=558.0s)]
*  in 2005 NIH [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=565.5999999999999s)]
*  It studies on coronavirus that showed hydroxychloroquine [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=567.92s)]
*  Obliterated it and then in 2013 2014 [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=572.3599999999999s)]
*  Fauci funded studies on MERS and SARS which are [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=576.3599999999999s)]
*  Coronaviruses and again show that hydroxychloroquine completely destroyed it. Okay. So what was the difference this time whenever they did? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=581.0s)]
*  What the problem was and see the Chinese it the pandemic only lasted for two months [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=589.0s)]
*  Why because they were doing early treatment? They were also doing a lot of other stuff really aggressively locking people up [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=595.12s)]
*  At COVID but they were treating them. They were treating them with chloroquine, which is hydroxychloroquine plus [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=602.28s)]
*  They were treating with antibiotics and [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=608.84s)]
*  Inflammatories on [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=611.6s)]

*  Antibodies and vitamins all the things that we know work that is we weren't treating we weren't doing a lot of you were not [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=616.6800000000001s)]
*  doing any early treatment and the reason for that is this the [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=622.66s)]
*  Fauci was focused on the vaccines was [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=628.24s)]
*  98-billion-dollar enterprise and [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=632.4s)]
*  He had to get for that enterprise to work he had to get them emergency use authorization because otherwise [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=636.0400000000001s)]
*  The pandemic would be over by the time they got their real, you know permits their licenses [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=643.0s)]
*  You had to get them emergency use authorization. It is illegal [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=649.64s)]
*  under federal law [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=654.92s)]
*  To give emergency use authorization for any vaccine [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=656.92s)]
*  If there is an existing drug that has been approved for any purpose that is demonstrated [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=661.4399999999999s)]
*  Demonstrated effective against the target disease right in hydroxychloroquine you said had been had been demonstrated effective [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=667.44s)]
*  It was and now there's 285 peer-reviewed studies that show that 80% of the people [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=673.58s)]
*  Who went to the hospital should not have gone if they had gone hydroxychloroquine or ivermectin early? [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=681.2s)]
*  They would never not have gone to the hospital and they would not have died [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=686.36s)]
*  If Tony Fauci recognized that [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=690.1600000000001s)]
*  The entire vaccine enterprise would have collapsed because he could not have given that it would have been illegal for him to give [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=693.4s)]
*  Emergency use authorization to any vaccine. So we had to kill those drugs up front who? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=701.52s)]
*  Who controls the emergency use authorization? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=707.52s)]
*  He really he does because he was in charge of the covered response and he's the one who decided [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=710.52s)]
*  He's the one who decided we're not gonna do early treatment [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=718.72s)]
*  We're gonna wait [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=722.64s)]
*  make sure everybody has to go to the hospital and [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=724.72s)]
*  We're gonna tell everybody lock yourself up [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=728.88s)]
*  put the whole country under house arrest and [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=732.56s)]

*  80% of the people who died from covid were vitamin D deficient [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=765.24s)]
*  We know that vitamin D completely it destroys coping [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=769.44s)]
*  There's a study that came out three weeks ago that said if people anybody who had 50 [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=775.12s)]

*  Did not get covered and it said theoretic hypothetically [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=794.76s)]
*  you could have [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=799.48s)]
*  Completely eliminated coven to ask by making sure people had adequate vitamin D. Yeah [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=801.3199999999999s)]
*  We never heard that sunshine [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=807.04s)]
*  And people have known that for years. We know zinc works against common cold. Yeah, it did seem interesting [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=809.36s)]
*  There was no like okay. These are things you can do to help prevent yourself from kovat. Everything was just [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=814.36s)]
*  Wait till you got the vaccine put a mask on that's a good point social distance [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=821.0799999999999s)]
*  Lock yourself in the house [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=826.68s)]
*  Well even also the weird thing of if people got it that they sent them back [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=828.32s)]
*  Like just go home and be in a room at your house. That was weird to me [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=832.0400000000001s)]
*  It's like well if this is so deadly [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=836.44s)]
*  Then why is my friend Brendan you just told him to go home and be in a separate room than his family [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=838.6400000000001s)]
*  Who's in this but not to like be in different buildings? [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=843.74s)]
*  And that's the thing or they're sending sick people to nursing homes. We're gonna kill everybody in the nursing home [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=847.36s)]
*  It's the inverse of everything that you that we knew that you're supposed to do in the pandemic [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=853.52s)]
*  It's the inverse of everything that Chinese did the Chinese [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=859.2800000000001s)]
*  If you were sick, they grabbed you they brought you to a hospital and they gave you early treatment [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=863.12s)]
*  They would not let you go home what Americans were told to do [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=867.76s)]
*  Go home till you get so sick that you're gonna die [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=871.12s)]
*  Oh, yeah [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=874.58s)]
*  then go to the hospital while every one of those hospital visits was a [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=875.48s)]
*  Super spreader event because that person now is infecting there. They're putting maximum viral loads out into the environment [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=879.36s)]
*  They're infecting their whole family. They're they're infecting the uber driver the door dash [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=886.6s)]
*  infecting the people in the hospital the people in the ambulance and [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=892.08s)]
*  Dry cleaner not what it's not what you would want to do if you wanted to stop the pandemic, right? [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=895.96s)]
*  So then my question this there would be like [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=901.72s)]
*  Do you feel like but did Fauci know this did you do you so like with the book? [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=905.4200000000001s)]
*  Are you saying that they knew this in advance? [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=910.6600000000001s)]
*  Like they knew that hydroxychloroquine would help so they kind of alleges that they shut down a lot of like the I think it's [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=913.7s)]
*  I don't know if it's over-the-counter or under counter hydroxychloroquine like there's places where it was it was allowed over the [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=921.5200000000001s)]
*  Canada France many other countries [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=926.94s)]
*  The [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=930.02s)]
*  Hydroxychloroquine is available or was available over the counter and at the beginning of January [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=931.06s)]
*  As soon as they heard coronavirus was circulating a [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=937.3s)]
*  They those countries reclassified it as a poison [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=941.8199999999999s)]
*  But that you can only get it by prescription now, but they felt you have anything to do with that [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=945.8599999999999s)]
*  The countries that didn't do that [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=950.8599999999999s)]
*  The African countries where hydroxychloroquine is taken every Sunday, it's called Sunday Sunday in Africa because everybody takes [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=953.54s)]
*  Malaria prevention [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=962.0600000000001s)]
*  Those countries the death rate per million population was two one two three four five [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=966.02s)]
*  in our country twenty two hundred per million population died from COVID and [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=973.42s)]
*  In Tanzania less than one twenty two hundred so we had [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=979.14s)]
*  2200 times the rate of death as the Tanzanians had we had a thousand times the rate of death as the Chinese [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=983.78s)]
*  You look at the African countries and nobody's dying [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=992.94s)]
*  And one of the reasons for that is probably that they're all on ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=996.58s)]
*  Do you think they could be under reporting over there too? Because there's less information [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1001.58s)]
*  Yes, that could be happening but we're also over reporting here yeah and but everybody agrees that [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1006.22s)]
*  Those countries have done better than us. We don't you know, you make a good point [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1013.94s)]
*  We don't know the there's been such sloppy hap as a reporting that we really don't know what happened in our country [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1017.78s)]
*  I mean even CDC says [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1024.06s)]
*  That only six percent of the Americans who died from COVID had only COVID at the [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1027.42s)]
*  Average number of comorbidities in the other people who died and 94 percent was [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1033.82s)]
*  3.8 comorbidities potentially fatal comorbidities, so [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1041.3s)]
*  We don't know whether they died with COVID or whether they died of the COVID and I'll never know that [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1046.18s)]
*  Do you do do you believe that they knew before? [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1053.5s)]
*  Like did they know? [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1057.78s)]
*  Like that the virus was coming or did was this a sub like a surprise thing that happened and then they I [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1060.1399999999999s)]
*  say they but like the [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1066.66s)]
*  you know, I guess who am I even trying to say like because I know the book kind of the book talks about how [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1069.1399999999999s)]
*  like big pharma basically pharmaceutical companies and like [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1075.1s)]
*  Like fancy rich people basically I guess are powerful people kind of like [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1081.46s)]
*  Cannibalized the [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1087.14s)]
*  Hydroxychloroquine thing I don't know if cannibalize is the word but like tried to sink it like there was a test that they did like [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1089.22s)]
*  European test study or something where they use too much [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1093.8200000000002s)]
*  Yeah to show the trials that it didn't work. Yes [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1096.74s)]
*  What happened like how'd they get us to believe that hydroxychloroquine didn't work they what they did was Bill Gates funded these [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1101.02s)]
*  studies [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1109.3400000000001s)]
*  solidarity study [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1110.74s)]
*  Each groups of studies with thousands of people [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1112.78s)]
*  So all the narrative study recovery study and remap study and in those studies [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1116.26s)]
*  He studied hydroxychloroquine [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1122.78s)]
*  Supposedly, but what they really did hydroxychloroquine only works if you give it to people in the first ten days after infections or first symptoms [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1125.34s)]
*  Okay [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1133.08s)]
*  If you could give it to him once in their hospital the disease has changed at point and it's not very effective shifter [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1133.78s)]
*  So they only gave it to people who were hospitalized in order to discredit it and then they gave people [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1141.3400000000001s)]
*  Three or four or five times the normal dose. They were giving them lethal doses [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1148.66s)]
*  And they were killing people and in fact [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1155.1000000000001s)]
*  the researchers that did the studies in Brazil killed I think [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1158.54s)]
*  29 out of 41 people who are in this body their elderly people [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1164.94s)]
*  They're currently they're currently being prosecuted for [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1170.58s)]
*  Homicide really by the Brazilian prosecutors, but that's how they were able to persuade the world that hydroxychloroquine is dangerous [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1174.58s)]
*  They were giving them dose of hydroxychloroquine that they knew were gonna kill people [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1183.54s)]
*  So but then wouldn't they be brought up on charges wouldn't they be like? [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1189.1399999999999s)]
*  In Brazil they are being brought up on charge so just the cut just just the testing facility [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1193.98s)]
*  But not it wouldn't go up to gates in fact wouldn't go up higher than that [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1199.14s)]
*  Well, if you you know if you read in my book [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1202.5s)]
*  There's an interview with one of the researchers who was being funded by gates [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1206.06s)]
*  And he's talking to a very famous scientist called Tess Laurie and this in the first chapter of the book [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1211.6200000000001s)]

*  She was talking to a scientist who was clearly on the take [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1234.98s)]
*  And she was saying to him we are looking at the same studies, and you know this drug works [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1239.66s)]
*  So why are you not telling the truth about it? And he's saying? [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1246.86s)]
*  I'm being pressured not to read days before he'd issued his study [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1251.78s)]
*  Gates donated forty million dollars to his university and the and it was gates [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1256.58s)]

*  Enterprise would have been torpeda spoiled. Yeah, because the [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1285.94s)]
*  Hql or whatever is that hql is what they call it. Hq h h [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1290.5s)]

*  It's like ten bucks a dose or something right it's not super expensive. It's like put together [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1297.7800000000002s)]
*  Oh damn it's 30 cents a pill I got screwed and I freaking paid it up [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1302.58s)]
*  Yeah, the batch I bought is a little spicier than that, but um, but so but so [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1307.4599999999998s)]
*  But why would why would they do it it was just to make they and remdesivir is [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1314.74s)]
*  $3,000 right and then of course the vaccines which don't work [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1320.06s)]
*  You know are making even more than that [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1325.86s)]
*  I mean not more per does but they're making you know huge amounts of money [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1328.14s)]
*  well, let's stick in the space right now where it's like so the [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1332.3000000000002s)]
*  So they they try to create articles and stuff that just in trials that dissuaded people from using the hydroxychloroquine [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1336.26s)]
*  There's a lot of that about that in the book. Yeah [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1343.22s)]
*  and the information [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1345.94s)]
*  Because I would see stuff like you would see stuff come up sometimes on social media like this and you know [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1348.98s)]
*  Oh, what if this works, you know where people are having a fact [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1353.7800000000002s)]
*  Effectiveness with this and it would always be shut down right it would be like [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1356.5400000000002s)]
*  either just lambasted by just the the masses or it would be like [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1360.74s)]
*  Scrapped from platforms like scrubbed out of platforms, right? Like you saw this sometimes with information [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1369.0600000000002s)]
*  How do they how would the people who are creating this this plan basically [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1375.3400000000001s)]
*  To get the this vaccine through how would they also be able to get people to then halt any information [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1381.5s)]
*  That's coming out. That's contradictory because there's just so many people that can put out information, you know [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1388.5s)]
*  Yeah, and you know what I would say is we ought to have free speech [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1394.02s)]
*  Is that you know if there if somebody's telling a lie on the social media? [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1399.46s)]
*  if somebody's [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1405.38s)]
*  saying something that is [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1406.82s)]
*  Saying something that is not true that the remedy for that is not shutting them down [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1409.02s)]
*  Right remedy that is more speech is being able to show people only [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1415.06s)]
*  You know let ideas triumph in the marketplace [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1421.78s)]
*  Yeah, and not somebody be in charge of shutting them down, but very early on in the pandemic [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1425.1399999999999s)]
*  The media and the social the media is funded by pharma and they have been doing censorship on pharmaceutical issues [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1431.54s)]
*  decades [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1439.06s)]
*  But the social media really for the first time started acting as sensors and you know [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1440.22s)]
*  Many of these companies are deeply tied in with the pharmaceutical industry [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1446.46s)]
*  Google has three vaccine companies [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1452.22s)]
*  Google makes one of those companies it owns three vaccine companies. Well Google's [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1455.86s)]
*  Parent company is called verily or alphabet and at companies. So [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1461.86s)]
*  Google has sister companies. Yeah [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1468.42s)]
*  That are making vaccines. Oh, so the vaccines they make women are always up to something. Yeah [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1471.06s)]
*  Zuckerberg has about a billion dollars [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1478.26s)]
*  invested in vaccines of you know from his private his [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1481.5s)]
*  Foundation so a lot of the big money that are tied into these that are tied into [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1486.26s)]
*  Tech companies. They also own [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1490.9s)]
*  Pharmaceutical companies and they're tied they have deals with pharmaceutical companies like [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1493.42s)]
*  Google has a 70 I think a 76 million dollar deal with GlaxoSmithKline and they and you know, they [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1498.94s)]
*  Have all kinds of deals with the pharmaceutical company to mine information health information from their [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1508.98s)]
*  Databases and so they're really kind of part of the pharmaceutical industry [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1516.02s)]
*  Right and why is it that that industry has gotten so [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1520.26s)]
*  How did we let this industry the pharmaceutical business get so big? [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1524.38s)]
*  I mean I see it all the time like in recovery places and stuff like that people just I [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1528.58s)]
*  See some people that I feel like are alcoholics and I see some people that are victims of just insane medications [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1533.46s)]
*  It's like you see people whose lives are just been wrecked by pills that they couldn't combat if they had a million weapons [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1539.0s)]
*  You know the power of some of the oxycodons and all of that stuff [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1545.54s)]
*  How did we let these pharmaceutical companies start to net like control the way? [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1549.64s)]
*  How do we let them like? [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1556.4s)]
*  bypass whatever [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1558.92s)]
*  government we had looking out for us or something and [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1561.0800000000002s)]
*  How do we let this happen does that make sense? Yeah. Okay good [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1565.16s)]
*  one of the issues is [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1569.72s)]
*  Pharmaceutical advertising what they call direct to consumer advertising [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1572.28s)]
*  So there's only two countries in the world that allow [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1575.6000000000001s)]
*  pharmaceutical companies to advertise to the consumers [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1578.96s)]
*  Other countries companies say no you can't do advertising if you want a drug go to your doctor and he will tell you [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1582.44s)]
*  in our country in [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1589.6000000000001s)]
*  1997 we changed the rule [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1592.0s)]
*  so that allow pharmaceutical companies to advertise on TV Oh [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1594.44s)]
*  so in [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1599.6000000000001s)]
*  2017 I went to the [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1602.04s)]
*  To the [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1604.6399999999999s)]
*  President of Fox News I called Roger Ailes. Oh, yeah, I remember a very famous guy and he's dead, huh? [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1606.28s)]
*  He yeah, he died, but when I was 19 years old I [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1612.24s)]
*  Spent three months with him in a tent in East Africa [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1617.44s)]
*  And I had this weird relationship because he was like for me, you know politically he was like Darth Vader [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1622.08s)]
*  We had a personal friendship and we both enjoyed each other and he was [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1629.52s)]
*  Very very kind to me, you know, I was doing environmental stuff and Fox News doesn't like the environment too much [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1635.28s)]
*  but he would make sure that his that the [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1641.56s)]
*  Shows on Fox News would always let me on to at least talk about my side of this story [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1645.4s)]
*  and I [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1651.72s)]
*  Went to him. I think around [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1653.72s)]
*  2018 I went to him with a movie that we had just made about mercury and vaccines and [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1656.6000000000001s)]
*  He had a child who had been that he suspects it was vaccine injured. Mm-hmm [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1662.92s)]
*  He was very sympathetic to this movie and he saw it he watched it [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1669.1200000000001s)]
*  He believed it, but he said I cannot let you go on to my network to talk about it [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1673.84s)]
*  and he said if any of my [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1677.84s)]
*  Hosts allowed you on to their show. I would have to fire them [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1680.68s)]
*  And if I didn't I would hurry here from Rupert meaning Rupert Murdoch within ten minutes and he said to me [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1685.8s)]
*  during non-election years [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1693.56s)]
*  We get Fox News for its evening news. That's up to 70% of its revenues [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1696.1200000000001s)]
*  from [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1703.96s)]
*  From pharmaceutical companies. Oh, and if you look and he said that's the banker [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1705.4s)]
*  Typically there's 22 ads on a on an evening news show and [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1710.72s)]
*  Typically about 17 of those are pharmaceutical ads. So those companies are not just [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1717.36s)]
*  Using that as a platform to promote their products. They are dictating content on that news show and that's why [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1723.76s)]
*  Anderson Cooper makes 12 million dollars a year a [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1731.48s)]

*  Is coming from Pfizer [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1737.96s)]
*  Typically, yeah [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1740.08s)]
*  He knows who he's working for right and that's why you know [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1742.1200000000001s)]
*  He's always promoting the flu shots and vaccines and medications and all of this and telling you you need to lock down [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1745.24s)]
*  You need to do what the pharma tells you to do [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1751.88s)]
*  And meanwhile, they locked us all down. They put us, you know, they induce this [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1754.72s)]
*  This is condition called Stockholm syndrome where Americans are living in terror [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1759.8s)]
*  They become grateful to their captors and they believe that the only way to return to normal and to you know to survive is [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1765.0s)]
*  To is total compliance to the you know to their captors and that's what we're kind of dealing with now in our country [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1772.68s)]
*  Why aren't there more people who try to stare who are trying to? [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1780.04s)]
*  Speak out against this. I what's what's interesting so much about about the book so far that I've read is [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1785.4s)]
*  Just how many it resonates with like these really like fears and kind of questions [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1791.48s)]
*  I've had about this whole thing like a lot of it hasn't passed like some of the smell tests for me [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1796.28s)]
*  Ironically just I've just never felt comfortable with some of the ways some of this has been handled [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1801.6000000000001s)]
*  Like I've witnessed friends like I've had six friends that overdosed in the past two years. Yeah, and they're dead [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1805.4s)]
*  You and I both know a lot of people and yeah, and it's just inner dead like and you know, like they didn't die of COVID [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1810.14s)]
*  They died because they couldn't get into there. There are no recovery rooms. There's no meetings [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1816.06s)]
*  There's no connection of humanity, you know, it's like people they don't know that somebody cares about them because they're not seeing other humans every day [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1819.72s)]
*  They're locked away [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1826.58s)]
*  Because of the mass and stuff it just seems like how would there not be more of a just [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1828.84s)]
*  revolt coming out of more people to [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1834.64s)]
*  Question this it feels like because because of fear [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=1839.76s)]

*  Now Avril Haynes is the top spy in America. She is the and she is the one [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2024.88s)]

*  You have people from the pharmaceutical companies mainly Johnson & Johnson the biggest one [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2057.2000000000003s)]
*  They do and you have another guy [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2062.44s)]
*  Peculiar guy George Gale who's the head of the Chinese? [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2065.72s)]
*  CDC [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2071.16s)]
*  Anybody so George Gale must have known yeah that this was circulating at that point [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2073.56s)]
*  By the way any of your listeners who does not believe what I'm saying can go and look up event 201 [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2079.6s)]
*  It's still on YouTube and this was before the [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2086.08s)]
*  It was after it started circulating, but none of us knew about it [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2089.72s)]
*  This is after the NSA had said that this had occurred the NSA now says looking back [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2094.0s)]
*  I see this is heard occurs and that's on they didn't know [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2099.56s)]
*  So then the world did not know until around January 3rd [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2103.12s)]
*  So then there was a big get-together of some of them. They're all together planning. What? [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2108.0s)]
*  Oh, here's how we're gonna handle a coronavirus pandemic if it happens [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2112.2s)]
*  Was Fauci there? No Fauci was not there, but there were people from his agency there [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2116.48s)]
*  And [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2121.24s)]
*  the interesting thing is [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2122.64s)]
*  There was no discussion of public health. They weren't saying how do we get to get repurposed medications? How are we gonna link? [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2125.16s)]
*  11 million doctors frontline physicians around the world on a communication grid [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2133.3199999999997s)]
*  That we can quickly figure out what's working. You know, what's working in Bangladesh? What's working in Argentina? [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2138.9199999999996s)]
*  What are the best protocols? What are the best repurposed medications that seem effective? [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2144.9199999999996s)]
*  Right like what's already working against this type of thing that we could ask people to get it prepared and get on now to help [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2149.36s)]
*  Themselves. Well, nobody even when it starts if a coronavirus pandemic starts [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2154.6400000000003s)]
*  You want to be able to talk to all the doctors who are treating it around the world and find out because there may be a guy [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2160.52s)]
*  In Argentina, which there was dr. Covello [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2166.76s)]
*  Who's got good Intel who was giving? I've remacked into people [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2169.96s)]
*  He gave it to 700 frontline health care workers and he gave a placebo to 458 [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2175.6s)]
*  Enough the 700 who got it not one of them got covered of the 400 who didn't got it 53% got covered [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2181.92s)]
*  So he knew that very early on [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2188.76s)]
*  But that wasn't being communicated and if you were found she had really wanted to do a public health response [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2191.64s)]
*  You'd be connecting all these doctors and mining. What is the best intelligence? What's the best way to treat people? [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2198.44s)]
*  How do we avoid hospitalizations? How do we avoid death? [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2204.64s)]
*  You're saying they were just connecting more of the business side of it. They weren't the only thing they were doing [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2208.16s)]
*  Was they were saying how do we use a pandemic? [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2214.2s)]
*  to clamp down totalitarian controls to essentially [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2218.12s)]
*  Execute a coup d'état against democracy. How do we get rid of the Bill of Rights? Oh you think that they brought that up in this meeting? [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2223.7999999999997s)]
*  Listen [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2230.52s)]
*  Nobody should believe me on anything [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2232.04s)]
*  They should go and do the research themselves and you go to event 201 and here's what you'll see [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2234.72s)]
*  The fourth simulation that day it took breaks [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2240.7999999999997s)]
*  There was a total of four the fourth one is the longest one that a whole simulation is [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2244.4s)]
*  How do you get the social media companies? [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2249.52s)]
*  to censor [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2252.6s)]
*  descent and how [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2254.6s)]
*  specifically [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2256.88s)]
*  Do you get them to not talk about the fact that this was a lab generated virus? [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2258.12s)]
*  They said the George Geo says that and this is what they're talking about for two hours [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2263.2s)]
*  This is an October. What was their fear that if people thought it was a lab generated virus at then they would start pointing fingers [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2268.72s)]
*  Chinese blaming not only the Chinese but blaming public health officials who were all funding, you know those studies in Wuhan [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2275.68s)]
*  It was not just Fauci who was funding the gain-of-function studies it was [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2283.8s)]
*  the [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2289.1200000000003s)]
*  USAID which is a CIA conduit. It was DTREP the Defense Threat [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2290.7200000000003s)]
*  reaction at reduction agency [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2296.84s)]
*  And it was a Pentagon through DARPA and Barda. So they were giving hundreds of millions of dollars [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2299.36s)]
*  to develop coronavirus [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2304.88s)]
*  Superbugs that could cause pandemics and they were doing it with the Chinese [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2307.52s)]
*  So you're saying that you believe that the whole thing was even planned ahead that no, I I'm not saying it was planned ahead [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2312.44s)]
*  I'm saying and this is not controversial. We know this was happening as well documented. They were publishing about it [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2318.32s)]
*  Okay, so you're publishing they were doing this research there. They were doing research to develop bio weapons, right? [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2324.32s)]
*  They were saying we're doing the research [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2329.96s)]
*  Because the same research that we need to do to develop bio weapons. We can also develop vaccines [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2332.88s)]
*  It was illegal for them to develop bio weapons. I see because they were saying we're doing bio weapons research, but it's clear they were doing [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2338.2s)]
*  What's weird to create a murder test of prison is that's a weird thing [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2346.56s)]
*  It's like why would you you know train murderers just to test out a prison facility you built? [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2349.8599999999997s)]
*  But is it the same people paying to do the trials that were that own the vaccine? [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2355.12s)]
*  Well, the thing is Tony found it [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2360.72s)]
*  It was an anthrax attack Oh damn on our country in 2001 [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2363.8s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I remember it 9-eleven. I remember so and in [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2368.84s)]
*  1972 or 69 we signed a [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2373.5800000000004s)]
*  Treaty that said you can't develop bio weapons anymore [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2377.0s)]
*  And so nobody touched them. The CIA was secretly doing it, but the Pentagon was not [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2380.7200000000003s)]
*  in 2001 after the anthrax attacks and the anthrax attacks [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2387.56s)]
*  Were blamed on Sana who's saying and they were used as a justification [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2392.72s)]
*  He's a fat rat see that guy's a fat. You know what I'm saying? They played anything you pay anything later turned out the FBI's [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2398.0s)]
*  Investigation showed that the anthrax had not come from said on the Senate had come from one of three [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2405.3999999999996s)]
*  US Army laboratories [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2411.48s)]
*  Somebody in the military had something to do in the US military with those anthrax attacks [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2415.0s)]
*  Okay, what happened is after the anthrax attacks? [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2420.78s)]
*  They use that as an excuse to start developing bio weapons again [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2424.7400000000002s)]
*  The Pentagon did not want to do it within the Pentagon because they said because it was a loophole in the treaty that said [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2429.94s)]
*  You can't develop bio weapons, but you can do dual use research dual use means [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2437.34s)]
*  Research that is bio weapons research, but it also is useful for developing vaccines [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2443.86s)]
*  So they began [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2449.58s)]
*  funneling 1.6 billion dollars a year to Tony Fauci to do weapons research because he [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2451.6600000000003s)]
*  What would be the Pentagon didn't want to do it in the Pentagon because they said nobody's gonna believe that we're doing vaccine research [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2459.3s)]
*  I see it would just be too erroneous [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2465.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, so they found it out Fauci and they gave him a 68% race and where was he at the WHO? [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2467.58s)]
*  He was an idea did he ever work for the WH now, oh yeah, he worked for 50 years at NIH [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2474.2200000000003s)]
*  That year his salary went up 68% from the Pentagon [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2481.02s)]
*  And today's the highest paid person in the federal government. That's insane to me [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2486.5s)]
*  Yeah, but his 70% of his budget is for doing this bio weapons research [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2491.38s)]
*  That's why he had to keep doing it even when Obama ordered him to stop in 2014 [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2496.5800000000004s)]
*  That's when he moved it offshore to Wuhan [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2502.86s)]
*  And they all moved to Wuhan. So Obama tried to shut him down [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2506.1s)]
*  What happened is in 2014 four of his bugs escaped or three of his bugs escaped from different labs [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2509.86s)]
*  and 300 scientists petition Obama and said you got to shut down Fauci because he's doing this research [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2517.1400000000003s)]
*  He's gonna release a bug that is gonna cause a global pandemic [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2523.6200000000003s)]
*  Obama ordered him to stop [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2528.98s)]
*  He illegally continued to do the worst of these studies at the University of North Carolina with a scientist called Ralph Barak [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2531.38s)]
*  And then but he began funneling huge amounts of money laundering it through this, you know this [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2539.42s)]
*  sketchy a cotton man called Peter Daszak, a zoologist who was working for the CIA and [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2547.3s)]
*  He began and the CIA and DARPA began funding all of this money [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2554.38s)]
*  $100 million through Daszak to distribute to Chinese military scientists at the Wuhan lab [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2559.46s)]
*  Okay, to do the studies there to do the studies and the purpose of doing the studies is they say it's for vaccines [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2565.94s)]
*  But it was really this Chinese were really open say with they said we're doing bio weapons research. He didn't care [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2572.5s)]
*  Yeah, Chinese are whatever the Americans were all saying. This is vaccine research. The Chinese were saying [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2578.1800000000003s)]
*  This is weapons research. They'll flick a cigarette right into a damn rock and you're a baby. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2583.46s)]
*  One of the really telling studies at [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2588.62s)]
*  Fauci funded at the University of North Carolina [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2592.58s)]
*  Was a study that [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2596.26s)]
*  Called a seem to develop what they called a seamless ligation process [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2599.34s)]
*  Which was a way of hiding the human tampering. So what they were doing is they were taking coronaviruses [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2605.42s)]
*  And infected bats [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2611.9s)]
*  They were removing the spike protein that could only infect bats [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2614.06s)]
*  And they were building inserting a spike protein that was designed to infect humans [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2618.94s)]
*  They they use the way they tested is they had humanized mice with human lungs [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2624.82s)]
*  They had bred mice with human lungs and they were testing these microbes on those mice and if the mice got sick [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2630.86s)]
*  Humans would get sick because they had an age-old [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2637.44s)]
*  Right and human lungs and how do you even get a human lung in a mouse? [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2641.04s)]
*  with a little tiny tweezers [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2646.04s)]
*  But so they're over there doing so what what how would she funded [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2650.7200000000003s)]
*  Not only was he funding them to switch up [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2656.28s)]
*  These spike protein that are only infected bats and switch it for ones that can only infect humans [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2658.92s)]
*  At then he was [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2665.36s)]
*  Developing process for hiding the evidence of human tampering [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2667.36s)]
*  That's the last thing that you would want to do if you cared about public health, right which allows, you know malevolent people [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2672.12s)]
*  To conceal the fact that this virus was human-made [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2680.12s)]
*  And so it had nothing to do with vaccines [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2683.92s)]
*  It was about and he funded it Ralph Barak who he gave he gave 57 [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2686.96s)]
*  Grants to this one scientist [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2692.92s)]
*  He called it Barrett calls it his no-seem process [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2695.5600000000004s)]
*  So it's a process where you can alter it and then nobody can see it [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2698.88s)]
*  He then taught that process to the Chinese military scientists. She shangley [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2705.92s)]
*  She was a bad lady and he taught her how to do it and and for two years the Chinese went dark and [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2712.6800000000003s)]
*  Then we had COVID-19 [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2720.6s)]
*  So do you think that that they that it was created on purpose then and then it got out like was the do you think that? [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2723.7599999999998s)]
*  that was created on purpose and then it [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2730.68s)]
*  because they knew that they would be able to because I [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2733.7999999999997s)]
*  don't know if it's Fauci, but they knew that they would be able to then use the [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2737.56s)]
*  Here's the thing in my book. I don't do anything any of that kind of [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2742.08s)]
*  speculation, right [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2747.3199999999997s)]
*  What I show is the facts and then people I think if you read the facts you can make up your own mind [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2748.52s)]
*  There's a lot of facts in there. I mean look and there's so many cited sources [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2755.2s)]
*  I honestly felt like you were like a guy like we were playing the game clue and you're like in the room [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2758.44s)]
*  You're like you're like I'm in the library with the candlestick, you know [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2762.6s)]
*  It's exactly kind of what it really felt like the energy coming out of it. There's so much information [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2765.92s)]
*  I wanted the revelations in the book. Okay [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2770.08s)]
*  How G gave two point two million dollars bill it billion dollars [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2773.24s)]
*  To this little Cambridge company called Moderna [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2778.52s)]
*  And gates it to eights was pouring money into him to develop an mRNA vaccine [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2781.56s)]
*  The head of that company is a guy a French guy called Stephen Bonzell [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2787.64s)]
*  The company that built the Wuhan lab was a French company called B. Omiro [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2793.32s)]
*  part of their contract was to develop what they call a negative air system that [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2800.24s)]
*  keeps [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2805.92s)]
*  Airflow flowing outward. It's a very sophisticated and you need it in these BSL for labs [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2807.48s)]
*  These biosecurity for labs at the most [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2813.56s)]
*  protected lab protective labs in the world secure labs in the world and it's where they you need those labs to do these studies you [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2816.4s)]
*  need a negative airflow system because [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2823.64s)]
*  Some of these bugs are gonna get into the air right and they could go out gotta keep it indoors [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2826.52s)]
*  So they so he was contracted [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2830.84s)]
*  Your mirror the French company was contracted to build the negative airflow system, but they didn't do it [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2833.64s)]
*  The head of that company was Stephen Bansall. Mmm [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2841.9599999999996s)]
*  He then goes [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2846.64s)]
*  Without building that system. So he has a good idea [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2848.7999999999997s)]
*  At these bugs are gonna escape [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2852.8799999999997s)]
*  And goes and he becomes the head of [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2856.04s)]
*  Of of of Moderna [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2859.8s)]
*  and which vouches funding and in March of 2019 [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2864.6400000000003s)]
*  So this is five months before the you know, the escape he goes back. He's been denied a patent for his mRNA vaccine [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2870.1200000000003s)]
*  He goes back and reapplied to the US Patent Office for the patent and he in the patent application [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2878.6400000000003s)]
*  He says there is an urgency that you give this patent to me processes immediately [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2884.56s)]
*  because the chance of an accidental or deliberate release of a laboratory generated virus [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2890.92s)]
*  That this vaccine is the only thing that it will cure it when they research and know that he has the ability to [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2899.7599999999998s)]
*  We you know, we have his patent application and it says that in there Wow [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2907.12s)]
*  Damn oh man, it's a lot to digest [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2911.64s)]
*  I'm very impressed that you made an effort at least read it. Yeah, I think I'm maybe I think I'm maybe almost [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2915.68s)]
*  I could possibly be halfway through [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2921.96s)]
*  There's parts where you talk about and this was something that I heard spoken about a lot that there were that [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2924.68s)]
*  doctors or [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2932.12s)]
*  Facilities got more money if there was a kovat death [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2933.6s)]
*  Than if it was a regular death, yeah, is that true or not? Yes. Okay, and you know the hospital systems [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2937.02s)]
*  were heavily incentivized to [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2945.5s)]
*  classify [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2948.62s)]
*  Every death they could as a cover death. So even people who came in with car accidents, we know this from a lot of whistleblowers [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2950.42s)]
*  Where if they could get a positive PCR test they were given remdesivir [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2957.98s)]
*  Oftentimes on intubation because they got [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2964.02s)]
*  $39,000 for doing those procedures maybe and if it was a kovat death and they coded it kovat [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2967.18s)]
*  Even if the person didn't die of kovat, he just had kovat in his blood [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2973.42s)]
*  They got a lot more money. So that was it's one of the things that really [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2978.38s)]
*  Confuses the data that we have and you know, we don't have any good data and that's one of the problems but [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2983.98s)]
*  Let me let me just talk [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2989.14s)]
*  Second about the Pfizer study because everybody is taking the Pfizer vaccine is the only one that has approval [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2991.7799999999997s)]
*  the Pfizer vaccine [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=2998.4199999999996s)]
*  Study the trial from the beginning. We knew it was gonna be rushed [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3000.62s)]
*  Tony Fauci promised us it's gonna be completely transparent and we're gonna get four-year study. So we're going to know [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3004.94s)]
*  You need long studies [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3012.7s)]
*  Oh [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3014.8599999999997s)]
*  Anything dude, it takes four years to get to college. You got to be four years to be a you know, a [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3015.8599999999997s)]
*  Banker. Yeah, I mean because there's a lot of injuries that come from medications, but particularly from vaccines [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3021.14s)]
*  Yeah, and if long diagnostic horizons or they have no long incubation period so you won't see them first in six months [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3027.7799999999997s)]
*  They're cancer to autoimmune diseases seizures [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3034.8199999999997s)]
*  developmental disease, of course you will not see for in a six month period and also [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3038.7s)]
*  What they call antibody dependent enhancement which coronavirus are notorious about if you get a vaccine in all the previous [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3044.3s)]
*  experiments with coronavirus vaccines [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3053.78s)]
*  The people who got the vaccine and the animals who got vaccine actually got sicker [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3056.34s)]
*  When the coronavirus came back around when they were exposed to wild coronavirus ham [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3061.3s)]
*  You won't know that until you have a long-term site. Oh [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3065.9s)]
*  What did he do? [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3070.42s)]
*  Six months into this study [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3072.18s)]
*  He declared it over who did Fauci. Yeah, he unblinded it [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3074.3399999999997s)]
*  Which means he told all the people in the placebo group in the placebo group. Yeah [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3079.3399999999997s)]
*  And he gave the vaccine to everybody in the placebo group [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3083.66s)]
*  So he erased the placebo group, which means we have no way ever [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3086.7s)]
*  have long-term [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3092.5s)]
*  Ideas about based on that study. There's no way to know long term because [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3095.22s)]
*  It was unblinded and everybody in the placebo group was given the vaccine. Yes [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3099.3399999999997s)]
*  Then they took that's crazy. Let me tell you the rest of this [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3104.5s)]
*  And they took the data from that six months. This shit sounds like clown pastes are shooting into people man [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3108.98s)]
*  I mean, it's just that sounds crazy [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3114.7s)]
*  And they took the data for that six months and they brought it to FDA FDA gave them a license [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3117.42s)]
*  What did that data show here's what it shows there's one graph that's called that s4 you can see it [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3123.2599999999998s)]
*  It's in my book in the first chapter and this this graph [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3128.9s)]
*  Is the most critical graph because it is the graph for all cause mortality in other words [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3133.38s)]
*  And you look at the vaccine group and you look at the placebo group [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3140.14s)]
*  Where who which of those groups had more people alive at the end of the study and more people dead at the end of the study [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3144.7799999999997s)]
*  And here's what it says [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3151.3s)]
*  It were roughly 22,000 people in the vaccine group 22,000 people in the placebo group [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3153.3s)]
*  At the end of six months, this is what their own data show [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3159.6200000000003s)]
*  One person in the vaccine group of those 22,000 died from kovat [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3164.38s)]
*  In the placebo group two people died from kovat [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3169.0600000000004s)]
*  That allowed Pfizer to tell FDA and the American public the vaccine group [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3173.9s)]
*  The vaccine is a hundred percent effective because two is a hundred percent of one. Yeah. Oh [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3180.34s)]
*  Most Americans when they hear the vaccine is a hundred percent effective. Yeah, I think if I get the vaccine [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3188.42s)]
*  I'm a hundred percent not gonna die of kovat [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3194.58s)]
*  Well, why wouldn't more information come out like other people be screaming that this seems like kind of a ridiculous thing [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3196.64s)]
*  Why does it seem like you're the press is all sense? [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3204.3s)]
*  I mean what's good when you air this show you're gonna get killed [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3207.14s)]
*  You might have to take it down, but let me just finish what happened so [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3216.58s)]
*  So why do really most Americans think I? [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3220.62s)]
*  100% won't die if I get the vaccine, but that's not what it means [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3224.42s)]
*  What it means is they have to give 22,000 vaccines [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3227.7799999999997s)]
*  save one life from kovat [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3231.9s)]
*  Now if you're gonna give those 22,000 vaccines [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3234.1s)]
*  You better make sure that the vaccine is not gonna kill even one person because it does right? [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3237.7400000000002s)]
*  It's now canceled the entire benefits. Well, here's what their data show and again, this is table s4 [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3243.58s)]
*  urge people to [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3251.1s)]
*  in the vaccine group 20 people died of [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3253.02s)]
*  22,000 over six months in the placebo group only 14 people died [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3257.38s)]
*  So what that suggests is that if you take the vaccine? [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3263.2999999999997s)]
*  You're 48% more likely to die over the next six months. Then if you don't how are they dying? [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3268.7799999999997s)]
*  Mainly heart attacks so in the vaccine group five people died of heart attacks [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3275.98s)]
*  In the placebo group only one what that means if you get the vaccine [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3281.54s)]
*  You have a 500% greater chance of getting a heart attack [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3287.3799999999997s)]
*  And if you don't based on that time period of that study [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3290.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3294.2999999999997s)]
*  And the study is probably a crap study that doesn't really mean anything because it were too few people in it [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3294.58s)]
*  Robert Malone who invented the mRNA vaccine told me this week. He said [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3301.4199999999996s)]
*  That study means nothing they needed. They can't do it a study with 22,000 people. It sounds like a lot [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3306.06s)]
*  They needed 400,000 they're gonna give this to 350 million people [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3313.02s)]
*  Yeah, they needed 400,000 people in the study to make any real prediction so [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3316.74s)]
*  These predictions probably aren't real but they're stuck with them because they're the ones who said we're only gonna put [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3322.62s)]
*  22,000 people in this study and what they show what their study shows [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3328.02s)]
*  is that [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3332.8599999999997s)]
*  For every life that they say from kovat they killed four people from heart attacks [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3334.5s)]
*  We got a question that came in actually right here from a guy [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3340.1s)]
*  For you Bobby. That's right. This is live. This is not life [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3343.46s)]
*  None of this is live and this question isn't live [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3346.7s)]
*  This is because I want to make sure you have an option of not playing this podcast video. No, I don't I think we're okay [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3348.58s)]
*  Yeah, I mean we you know, I'm genuinely curious and I think I worried about your career [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3356.66s)]
*  Well, the good I feel like I own my own career until [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3362.54s)]
*  Like I don't need a Hollywood career, you know [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3366.02s)]
*  But it's definitely I worry about like my career of like I guess maybe like YouTube canceling us or people saying that we can't do [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3368.14s)]
*  This anymore, you know, that's the scary part. Is this on YouTube? Yeah, that's me on YouTube [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3375.3s)]
*  So but our last one stayed up [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3380.7000000000003s)]
*  Okay, well, let's make a bet I'll bet you five bucks [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3384.3s)]
*  Inflations happen a lot. Let's make it ten [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3389.9s)]
*  We got a good question right here from somebody that came in [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3392.9s)]
*  Hey Theo. Hey, mr. Kennedy [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3396.5800000000004s)]
*  I'm here with a question for y'all [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3400.02s)]
*  So [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3403.02s)]
*  I got the kovat vaccine. I needed to to in order to keep my job. I live in the city of Philadelphia and [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3404.54s)]
*  is a [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3412.38s)]
*  They're pretty gung-ho about making sure everybody is vaccinated. But anyway, I got it and I ended up having [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3414.2200000000003s)]
*  Myocarditis like developing heart pain and a serious reaction as a result of it [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3422.38s)]
*  and [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3428.06s)]
*  I don't really know what to do [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3429.34s)]
*  I don't have good health insurance or anything like that. I can't really spend a lot of money to get to the bottom of it [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3431.62s)]
*  And all we hear in the news is like, oh, it's so rare for people to have these effects from it [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3438.98s)]
*  but like [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3444.46s)]
*  We don't hear much at all about what to do if you are one of the people that ended up having one of these [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3445.5s)]
*  side effects from the vaccine, so I [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3452.18s)]
*  Was wondering if mr. Kennedy here has any advice on what to do if you do get that that pumped up ticker and [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3455.1400000000003s)]
*  How to help it how to help deflate that bitch? [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3463.9s)]
*  Or I mean that person, you know [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3467.94s)]
*  I mean I could also had a stricken a strong carbonara sauce from a cousin or something that freaking amped his ticker up [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3470.46s)]
*  But um, but I think that's a really serious disease. I mean, I I [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3476.5s)]
*  Mean really serious 50% of people who are diagnosed with myocarditis [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3482.98s)]
*  Either die or require a heart transplant within five years. So a lot of these, you know [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3488.86s)]
*  The CDC is telling people well, you know, these are mainly mild case. There's no such thing as a model case [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3495.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, you you know what that means is they discharge you from the hospital [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3501.1400000000003s)]
*  And you go home and you have a six months of bed rest and a lot the people who are most [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3505.7400000000002s)]
*  Acceptable to it are athletes [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3511.3s)]
*  There is a very very strong Hong Kong study that came out a couple of weeks ago that says that [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3513.86s)]
*  For young people one in every twenty seven hundred is getting myocarditis [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3520.74s)]
*  That is huge particularly because we don't know if it's vaccine related [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3526.7s)]
*  No from the vaccine that are reporting myocarditis from the vaccine kids don't have heart attacks kids don't have strokes [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3530.62s)]
*  Yeah, they're myocarditis these athletes you're watching every day literally to a day now [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3537.46s)]
*  Athletes are collapsing on playing fields as from myocarditis and it's from the vaccines and there's no question about that [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3545.1s)]
*  And that's what this study shows [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3552.5s)]
*  One in twenty seven hundred people are getting myocarditis [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3555.02s)]
*  they for for kids [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3558.82s)]
*  There are two studies out for you know [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3561.82s)]
*  To children and a younger you are the more likely you are to get myocarditis from the vaccine [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3564.22s)]
*  What the Lancet study showed is that they were not able to find a single healthy child [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3570.7799999999997s)]
*  In America that died from kovat [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3577.8199999999997s)]
*  There's a there are children who died, but the people very obese or a lot of comorbidities [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3580.74s)]
*  It couldn't find any healthy child children who died in the jury Germany just released its database and very very similar [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3588.02s)]
*  They found the death rate in healthy children was three per million [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3596.6600000000003s)]
*  Okay, so three per million and under five zero literally zero not one kid found it [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3600.7400000000002s)]
*  Who is who died from kovat? [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3607.7000000000003s)]
*  If the death rate is three per million [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3611.38s)]
*  But one in every twenty seven hundred people are getting myocarditis [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3614.86s)]
*  That means you have a hundred times greater chance for every one person [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3620.5s)]
*  At their saving from kovat [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3627.2599999999998s)]
*  Are a hundred people getting myocarditis. What about this do? [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3630.18s)]
*  Couldn't it? [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3634.94s)]
*  But but you you're not an aunt you're not are you you're not anti you're an anti vaccination. Oh here [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3637.14s)]
*  Vaccination is does it help people or do you just not know the long term? What's gonna happen? [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3643.1s)]
*  I don't think anybody first of all the vaccine [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3648.98s)]
*  What Tony Fauci said the vaccine was gonna do it Bill Gates? [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3653.2599999999998s)]
*  Was that it was gonna prevent transmission and prevent hospitalization [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3657.2999999999997s)]
*  And prevent you from getting the disease and it doesn't do any of those [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3661.8199999999997s)]
*  It does not prevent transmission a vaccinated person according to the best science we have now [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3665.02s)]
*  Is the yeah and Tony Fauci has said this and I if you need it [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3671.34s)]
*  I'll send you the recording and you can put it in here. Okay [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3676.2599999999998s)]
*  He even says that you're equally likely [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3680.06s)]
*  To transmit the disease if you were vaccinated or unvaccinated [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3683.58s)]
*  There's we yeah, it feels hella confusing. I mean people are still out to wear a mask. You don't have to wear a mask [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3688.2599999999998s)]
*  It's this it's like and there's no [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3692.18s)]
*  You know people originally were saying that you're more likely to get a severe disease but when you look at the one database [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3695.4s)]
*  That seems most reliable [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3704.0s)]
*  Is the British the UK databases and what those databases are showing is that the people who get? [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3706.64s)]
*  Who got the vaccine are more likely to be hospitalized as what their data is showing? Okay [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3714.16s)]
*  Those data may be skewed in some way. They may not be [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3720.4s)]
*  Completely reliable, but it is the best database in the world and it's showing it is not showing that the vaccine will avoid [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3724.7599999999998s)]
*  Hospitalization or death we're not seeing that but why wouldn't like [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3732.0s)]
*  Fauci and Gates and some of these big-pocketed dogs have have a say so in that kind of study coming out [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3735.92s)]
*  Like why would you mean of the NHS data? That's raw data that is data that that you know it for many many years [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3741.92s)]
*  The [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3749.72s)]
*  British have been [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3751.44s)]
*  Publishing their mortality and morbidity data directly from the hospital directly from the corners directly from the health agency [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3753.04s)]
*  So anybody can look at that and when you look at that and you can you can compare on that [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3759.64s)]
*  Hospitalized people who were vaccinated to the hospitalized people who are unvaccinated and what you will see [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3766.16s)]
*  is that the that the [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3773.64s)]
*  You you're actually more likely to end up in a hospital on by that data, okay [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3776.88s)]
*  If you got the vaccine than if you did not right and that's still early in data, too [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3782.7200000000003s)]
*  We still need a long it's still early and we don't you know and also [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3787.1800000000003s)]
*  There may be the data could be data could be skewed and let me tell you how that people can understand [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3792.2000000000003s)]
*  You could argue is [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3801.2000000000003s)]
*  That the people who were early vaccinated mm-hmm [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3803.96s)]
*  Were less likely to get COVID early [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3808.3199999999997s)]
*  And when the vaccine wears off now [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3812.72s)]
*  There's more of that subset who are getting sick and getting hospitalized and people who are unvaccinated [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3816.08s)]
*  I'm by percentage. Oh [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3823.08s)]
*  So we don't know the answer that I doubt that that's really what's happening, but you know, we don't know [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3825.4399999999996s)]
*  How did um have have there been doctors that have come out and supported your book as well or is there like I mean [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3832.08s)]
*  There's a list of hundreds of doctors. I know this is not the data from doctors in there [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3837.84s)]
*  Yeah, but if you look at the beginning of the book, it's there are a couple of pages [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3842.0s)]
*  I've just very very tiny type of all the doctors who are [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3846.52s)]
*  You know who are opposing the Tony Fauci narrative [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3851.52s)]
*  And do you feel like has the book been? [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3855.76s)]
*  Have you been supported by any mainstream media lists you feel like it's growing in some senses [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3860.26s)]
*  Do you feel like the book has been completely boycotted by the media? [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3864.6200000000003s)]
*  But the sales have been amazing. We've been you know at the top of the bestseller less. I [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3869.34s)]
*  Mean the New York Times won't put us number one even though even if you were number one [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3876.0600000000004s)]
*  Well, we are number one because we know how many six and I know I think in the first week we sold not [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3880.98s)]
*  93,000 copies will Smith sold [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3887.02s)]
*  85,000 and [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3890.82s)]
*  He's the top I'm number seven and I sold more of my books and all the other ones [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3892.9s)]
*  But they still put me seven because I just think they don't you know [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3900.0600000000004s)]
*  They do not want to give me the publicity being number one [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3903.7000000000003s)]
*  Wall Street Journal put me number one the USA Today [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3907.34s)]
*  Which is the hardest one because they combine all the books in the world including fiction and nonfiction together [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3910.46s)]
*  So that's the hardest one to be number one and number one there [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3915.7s)]
*  publishers weakening number one Amazon number one number two or number three day after day after day and [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3919.5s)]
*  number one for the weeks yeah, I mean I've had a lot of people since you were coming on who certainly reached out to me and [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3926.22s)]
*  Applauded the fact that we're just gonna talk about it. We've had another good question that came in here [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3932.3799999999997s)]
*  Let's get on let's get to one of these [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3937.14s)]

*  Had a question in your book in the back you had a list of arbitrary decrees and I thought it was very interesting [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3949.42s)]
*  I was gonna get your opinion on New York's recent decree from de Blasio about [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3955.6600000000003s)]

*  We actually you know [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3966.82s)]
*  well [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3969.3s)]
*  It I mean I've already made the case if a vaccine is not preventing transmission [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3970.82s)]
*  What is the justification right or mandating that somebody take it yeah, you know I mean listen we sign the nerve [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3978.9s)]
*  I agree that's I've long that's my big question. Why do people have it doesn't seem deadly enough for people to have [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3986.3s)]
*  Even if it's deadly I mean it's my choice [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3992.7400000000002s)]
*  Nobody can make me take a medicine for my own good right and you know [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=3996.1000000000004s)]
*  there's a [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4000.9399999999996s)]
*  argument [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4002.5s)]
*  If me getting the vaccine is gonna prevent other people from getting the vaccine [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4003.8199999999997s)]
*  there's no argument that the state has the right to force me to take the vaccine, but [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4007.56s)]
*  There's no that argument doesn't exist because if you get the vaccine you're equally likely transmit the disease [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4012.4199999999996s)]
*  What it would and be you know, by the way? [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4019.98s)]
*  We sign the Nuremberg Protocol [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4023.2599999999998s)]

*  Individuals to take an experimental product with without their informed consent [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4040.86s)]
*  no form of commercial coercion is [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4046.46s)]
*  Is legal and [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4050.22s)]
*  The all of the vaccines that are available in this country now are [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4052.5s)]
*  Experimental they're all EUA. There's not one vaccine that is now available in the United States [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4057.1s)]
*  That's been approved the Pfizer vaccine one version of it the Comornati vaccine is approved, but it's not available in the United States. Oh [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4062.58s)]
*  Deplazio is ordering people to participate in a medical experiment and that's you know is not something we do in America [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4071.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, why has it become that how did we get from the point where it feels like these days like the government is more like [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4079.78s)]
*  Facebook and CNN and Twitter. These are the judge and the jury of everything as opposed to like [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4089.1800000000003s)]
*  you know human beings and I mean it's still human beings but as opposed to like an actual government as opposed to like [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4095.9s)]

*  It's like this it has such a power over. It's like how did we kind of let that happen? Was it just money that did it? [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4112.34s)]
*  Yeah, I mean my crazy. No, I think that's right and [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4119.42s)]
*  You know what we've seen this year is really pretty extraordinary to you [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4124.860000000001s)]
*  It's the it is the abolition of all of our Bill of Rights [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4128.7s)]
*  All of our Bill of Rights so they started out with with by controlling those tech companies [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4132.94s)]
*  They were able to effectively get rid of freedom of speech and freedom of expression [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4138.86s)]
*  Madison and Adams and Jefferson [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4144.9s)]
*  Said that we put [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4148.0599999999995s)]
*  Freedom of speech into the First Amendment [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4150.259999999999s)]
*  Because all of the other rights are dependent on it if a government [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4153.099999999999s)]
*  Can control can stop criticism or dissent? [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4157.46s)]
*  It has a license to commit any kind of atrocity. So as soon as they got rid of freedom of speech [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4162.18s)]
*  They went after the other half of the First Amendment, which is freedom of religion and worship [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4168.26s)]
*  It closed all the churches in our country for a year with no public hearing no debate. No, you know [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4173.62s)]
*  science Joan [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4180.9400000000005s)]
*  Then went after property rights. They controlled it. They shut down a million businesses [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4183.06s)]
*  With no due process no just compensation then they went after jury trials you cannot sue [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4188.24s)]
*  The the sixth and seventh amendment say this [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4194.28s)]
*  No American shall be denied the right of a trial of a jury of his before a jury of his peers for any [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4198.28s)]

*  well [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4209.599999999999s)]
*  That's all it says. There's no pandemic exception [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4211.04s)]
*  Today jury trials are going in our country for a if a vaccine company or pharmaceutical company [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4214.200000000001s)]
*  Injuries you you cannot so no matter how egregious really no matter how negligent they were no matter how reckless [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4219.76s)]
*  They are you cannot sue so if 20 million people die [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4226.18s)]
*  15 years from now from the vaccine there can't be a class-action suit. No Wow, you cannot sue them. There's no [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4229.56s)]
*  We gotta make a vaccine bro [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4237.240000000001s)]
*  So [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4239.8s)]
*  The vaccine will not give you immunity but it gives the company that made it immunity [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4244.16s)]
*  Liability, that's crazy. That's what's happening. And then [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4249.719999999999s)]
*  You know [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4253.08s)]
*  The prohibitions against warrantless searches and seizures are gone in there [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4254.5199999999995s)]
*  You know, they're doing you have to show your vaccine cards and you know, yes private medical information to people [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4258.76s)]
*  There's track-and-trace surveillance [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4264.68s)]
*  Well, it's cost me my value call it's starting to cost me and this is just my feeling and I am obviously a very sensitive [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4266.68s)]
*  Person but it's costing me a lot of what I feel like my whole purposes of being human are [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4272.400000000001s)]
*  And so it starts to make me feel like there's no real value in me being human [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4279.200000000001s)]
*  and so I think if you are already predisposed to ideas like that in your head and kind of negative self-thought and [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4282.88s)]
*  nihilism [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4290.320000000001s)]
*  nihilism [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4291.6s)]
*  Yeah, it's just I might have misdone it. I don't say an NIH IL ISM. Yeah. Yeah [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4292.96s)]
*  Neolism I didn't know that was it. But yeah, it's like if I'm already predisposed [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4299.320000000001s)]
*  Then that's where I see a lot of my friends who were perishing, you know, it's like because it's [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4302.4800000000005s)]
*  CDC says that [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4310.4800000000005s)]
*  One out of every four people under 20 contemplated suicide this year [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4313.76s)]

*  Farmer was like being able to manage all of this with power and money and influence, right? [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4417.08s)]
*  You know or manage at least like the information that was getting out [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4422.92s)]
*  And suppressing other information because they they [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4427.4400000000005s)]
*  advertised enough or were the biggest supporter of different [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4432.360000000001s)]
*  outlets [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4437.24s)]

*  Yeah, I think I'm saying like me like companies that would [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4459.52s)]
*  That is a really good question, but I I think one of the things they did for those companies is they bought them all off [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4462.64s)]
*  or they paid the airlines and they paid the the cruise lines and [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4470.28s)]

*  I think really destructive and that's where we're going [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4942.860000000001s)]
*  So what's gonna are people just gonna lose like just tyrants gonna take over and just attack the Samsung building or like what's gonna happen? [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4945.860000000001s)]
*  You know, I I think how do you rebel? This is happening in every country in the world [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4951.860000000001s)]
*  one place where [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4957.76s)]
*  people are [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4960.02s)]
*  standing up is [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4961.7s)]
*  Ironically, it's in the red states in America. Yeah, I was in Louisiana yesterday and I gave a [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4964.98s)]
*  speech yeah, and Haitian to [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4971.98s)]
*  The you know the legislature there and they voted against the you know [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4975.18s)]
*  The mandates to children and it was Democrats and Republicans voting against it was a bipartisan vote [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4980.62s)]
*  But I think in those a lot of the states you go to that state. There's no mass [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4987.18s)]
*  Same with Florida and with Texas people. I live in Tennessee some and there's no man. It's been fine [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4991.7s)]
*  Like that's the thing. I just don't understand what's going on [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4996.62s)]
*  Like Florida has the lowest infection rate in the country and it has the loosest rules [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=4999.58s)]
*  Yes, so what so I don't understand how none of the the reality of things isn't permeating [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5005.58s)]
*  I don't some of the smartest people I know [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5011.72s)]
*  asking questions [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5014.82s)]
*  Blowing my mind. Yeah, like one of my neighbors like the smartest dude [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5016.94s)]
*  I'm like dude. You don't think this like you you're the one who always tells me to ask questions and I forget and now here [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5020.78s)]
*  like you're not asking any quite like [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5026.82s)]
*  You you come back to LA and it's like there's a lot more mandates and stuff here in strictness even like I feel like it's [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5029.58s)]
*  Getting a little looser though [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5035.9s)]
*  But then you go you still get hostility from people if you ask questions about it. Yeah [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5038.82s)]
*  Why is there something inside of some people? They're just afraid to question or do you think that they just? [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5044.98s)]
*  I don't know some things for me to if I saw more people dying around me, you know [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5051.5s)]
*  And I'm not saying people haven't died, but I don't know one person that's died, you know, well people did die but [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5056.0199999999995s)]
*  People are dying the vaccine too and we're not you know, there's there's [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5062.5s)]
*  19,000 people [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5068.0199999999995s)]
*  Whose death has been reported after vaccination now during the [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5070.3s)]
*  in [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5076.0199999999995s)]
*  1976 when we had the vaccine the flu vaccine [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5077.38s)]
*  46 people died and they pulled the vaccine [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5082.06s)]
*  19,000 and what's what HHS says is that that system is only capturing 1% of the vaccine injuries [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5085.5s)]
*  It could be much much higher than that and you're seeing a lot of people who are [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5095.26s)]
*  Dropping dead of sudden death who are young people who should not be dying you read about it every day yesterday the [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5100.62s)]
*  editorial page editor of the Washington Post [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5108.22s)]
*  died suddenly and [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5111.06s)]
*  You're seeing that, you know, there's the sports figures who have dropped out on the field [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5113.22s)]
*  You're seeing those and those guys are not being reported as vaccine injuries. Mmm. Oh, you know [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5118.5s)]
*  But why wouldn't like places that are why wouldn't they be reported as vaccine? [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5124.66s)]
*  Is it and like why wouldn't we get that information? Who's gonna report it? [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5129.38s)]
*  The doctors, you know, first of all, it takes a half hour to do the report [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5133.9800000000005s)]
*  Doctors don't want to do it and the doctors are telling themselves that's not a vaccine injury [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5140.3s)]
*  That guy just had an heart attack, you know [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5144.54s)]
*  They don't want to admit to themselves that it's a vaccine particularly if they gave the vaccine to the guy [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5146.38s)]
*  They don't want to say it was an intervention that killed him [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5150.900000000001s)]
*  That's the problem with the voluntary system. You need a system that is a machine counting system one [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5154.820000000001s)]
*  Which you can easily do [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5161.92s)]
*  HHS actually developed one a look at [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5164.96s)]
*  All the they know who got it which vaccine [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5168.84s)]
*  under the batch number [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5173.280000000001s)]
*  Then you do a cluster analysis and saying are those guys more likely to die? [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5175.56s)]
*  Are they more likely to get diabetes? [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5179.76s)]
*  rheumatoid arthritis [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5182.2s)]
*  MS and the people who weren't you can look at that and you can do it very quickly [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5183.76s)]
*  But none of that is being done all of that kind of research gets blocked [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5187.84s)]
*  I [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5191.8s)]
*  Just blows my mind that that that there's no [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5192.84s)]
*  liability for these for the companies making things because I just feel we've had such a [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5195.76s)]
*  It's it's become obvious for me anyway, and it's just me that drug companies don't care about people [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5200.52s)]
*  You know like all the people that died of drug overdoses and oxycodone all those it's just like it [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5207.320000000001s)]
*  It just seems real obvious. So I don't know why [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5212.4800000000005s)]
*  There's just such an immediate truck like [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5216.320000000001s)]
*  Just a it was just this immediate almost like [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5219.88s)]
*  forced close everything was just closing and it just seemed like a [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5224.2s)]
*  Everyone was just gonna trust suddenly drug companies. That's the part that really I guess is always just made me uncomfortable [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5227.68s)]
*  You know, I mean I never trusted anybody. These are the same companies that gave us the opioid epidemic [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5233.68s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. It killed 56,000 kids a year and more [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5238.68s)]
*  More kids every year than died in the entire Vietnam War over 20 years [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5243.16s)]
*  And every year and we know they did it deliberately [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5248.160000000001s)]
*  The four big vaccine companies in this country Sanofi Merck Pfizer and Glaxo have paid [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5251.64s)]
*  $35 billion over the last 10 years [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5259.4400000000005s)]
*  in criminal penalties and damages [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5262.4800000000005s)]
*  or defrauding regulators for lying to doctors for killing hundreds of thousands of American Vioxx [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5265.84s)]
*  Which was Merck's drug it knew it was going to cause heart attacks and kill people [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5272.48s)]
*  I thought they can't be sued for oh, they can be sued for they can't sue for vaccinations [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5277.839999999999s)]
*  That's right for me, but even in the place where they can get sued [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5281.48s)]
*  Their criminal culture is part of who they are and he even know when they know they're gonna get caught they can get caught [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5286.759999999999s)]
*  You still do it. So what happens to that same company? [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5293.28s)]
*  When he knows there's no way he'll ever get caught because there's no discovery. There's no deposition [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5297.24s)]
*  There's no document searches and even if you find out that he killed you [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5302.48s)]
*  You can't sue him [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5308.879999999999s)]
*  Right. You think Fauci is an evil you think it's evil that's in him [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5310.5599999999995s)]
*  I mean, I mean are you saying that with this book that he's just an evil guy [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5314.839999999999s)]
*  Or do you think he's compromised with anybody have been him? It's just a power and he's just a pay [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5318.4s)]
*  He's just the man in the position. Is there darker forces at work? [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5322.919999999999s)]
*  Listen, we all as you know [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5327.32s)]
*  Think of ourselves as we measure ourselves by our intention rather than by our behavior [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5330.0s)]
*  So I don't know whether he I don't know how he views himself, but I I'm [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5335.04s)]
*  Know that he must believe that it's okay to impose collateral damage on people [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5342.160000000001s)]
*  In order, maybe he's convincing himself. There's a larger cause [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5349.280000000001s)]
*  But you know, I've documented again and again and again and how he's with the A's and B's [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5354.08s)]
*  He teed during the AIDS epidemic which he knew was poisoning people killed [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5359.52s)]
*  330,000 people and he knew it was doing that and that it was worthless and he let it happen [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5364.4800000000005s)]
*  Hannah Arendt who wrote a lot about the Third Reich and she was a you know, philosopher and writer and Holocaust survivor [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5369.92s)]

*  You know, dr. Fauci is I think he's a desk killer [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5415.12s)]
*  And do you think and how would what role does Bill Gates playing it so much? I know you've been mentioning him a lot in [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5418.400000000001s)]

*  We pay the highest prices and we have the worst health outcomes of the 79 top countries in the world [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5537.64s)]
*  We are the worst and he's been in charge the whole time. Yes, and is he the one who writes the checks for research? [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5544.32s)]
*  Is it his company? Yeah, he gives away [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5550.139999999999s)]
*  Seven point six billion dollars a year and him personally he gets to write the check who gets it. He chooses who gets it [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5552.96s)]
*  There's not a board that does it. No. Well [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5560.299999999999s)]
*  He chooses he runs that agency with a [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5562.92s)]
*  tight end [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5566.24s)]
*  What he does is he'll develop these drugs within his labs [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5568.32s)]
*  And they farm them out to you know, what they'll do is [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5573.280000000001s)]
*  In his lab, he has thousands of vials of coronavirus of dengue virus [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5578.360000000001s)]
*  Ankyl virus of flu of you know, all of the different polio whatever [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5584.52s)]
*  And they'll take different combination of molecules and they drip them into that lab culture and see if it kills the virus [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5589.96s)]
*  If it kills the virus and they have an antiviral now they have to see does it kill the rat? [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5598.0s)]
*  It kills the virus, but it doesn't kill the rat. Yeah, now they have a medicine [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5604.32s)]
*  Any farms that out to the university and he gives them money [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5609.719999999999s)]
*  So the university will will do animal studies and they'll do phase one studies, which is a hundred people basically [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5613.28s)]
*  He will give that [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5621.2s)]
*  University the Dean of that department who is called the principal investigator [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5623.08s)]
*  15 to 20 thousand dollars per recruit that Dean is a doctor. He's recruiting patients [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5627.719999999999s)]
*  to test this drug [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5635.24s)]
*  He's getting let's say twenty thousand dollars per patient that he recruits to participate in that for that trial [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5637.48s)]
*  The university skims off 50 to 75 percent of that money keeps it. So now the university is now [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5643.92s)]
*  partnering with [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5652.04s)]
*  Phase two studies and phase three where they're bringing in ten or twenty thousand people [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5655.0s)]
*  They now bring in the drug company and the drug company gets most of the patent [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5659.56s)]
*  Tony Fauci could keep some for himself for his agency [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5664.72s)]
*  or his individual [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5668.48s)]
*  The university gets keep on the university P I guess to keep it [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5670.28s)]
*  And then Fauci ushers it through the regulatory process. So here's the punchline between [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5674.76s)]
*  2009 and 2016 [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5680.92s)]
*  There were [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5683.16s)]
*  240 new drugs at word that were approved by FDA that came through Tony Fauci shop [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5685.76s)]
*  Oh, he is the biggest pharmaceutical incubator in the world. He's not yes [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5692.16s)]
*  He's the yeah, he's not doing what he's supposed to do which was [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5696.16s)]
*  Trying to figure out where's the autism epidemic coming from? Why do we now have? [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5700.2s)]
*  Diabetes and we talked about this last time we were together [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5705.16s)]
*  We got one question that came in about that actually from a young man and thank you for your time Robert [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5707.28s)]
*  Sup, mr. Kennedy. I have a question for you. I have a four-year-old [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5713.28s)]
*  Autistic son. I know you've done a little research with vaccines and how it all ties in together [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5718.04s)]
*  Maybe you could dive into that some and also with the technology growing [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5725.92s)]
*  Rapidly, do you think there's a chance for some normalcy for my boy moving forward in his life? [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5732.08s)]
*  Appreciate your time big fan Theo gang gang [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5739.52s)]
*  Yes, you kind of answered some of that. Yeah, where is he going from? [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5743.4s)]
*  like Oklahoma or something, huh an [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5748.4400000000005s)]
*  airplane or something, but [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5751.52s)]
*  Probably trying to get off the planet. I'm as scary down here. Well, I mean, here's what happened in my generation one in [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5754.4400000000005s)]
*  10,000 between 1 and 25 100 there's a couple different studies that look at the prevalence of autism [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5763.28s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah people are 67. So [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5769.28s)]
*  My generation between 1 and 25 101 and 10,000 people have all have autism [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5773.36s)]
*  Even today my age. I've never seen anybody with full-blown autism my age. Oh, I know a lot of people [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5779.4s)]
*  You know people who are [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5786.4s)]
*  Who are like the quirky uncle or the person whose ass Burgess or can't look you in the eye? [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5789.24s)]
*  Yeah party on I'm talking about full-blown awesome people men were six seven-year-old in diapers [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5794.76s)]
*  Wearing a football helmet head banging nonverbal [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5802.0199999999995s)]
*  non toilet trained [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5806.34s)]
*  Alabama fans basically [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5808.86s)]
*  But no, I know you're saying sorry, you know stimming toe walking [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5811.38s)]
*  I've never seen somebody like that and I have been around in election disabilities my whole life [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5815.22s)]
*  My family started Special Olympics best buddies, etc [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5819.7s)]
*  Never seen anybody my age with it in my my kids age group is one in every 22 boys [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5823.5s)]
*  According to CDC one in every 34 kids Oh [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5829.78s)]
*  Tony Fauci's job [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5834.3s)]
*  Is to figure out why that's happening it it when EPA was told Congress said to EPA [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5836.74s)]
*  Tell us what year the autism epidemic began EPA scientists came back and they said in 1989. It's a red line [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5843.9s)]
*  And so Tony Fauci's got a pretty easy job [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5852.1s)]
*  He used to figure out an exposure a chemical exposure or some other exposure [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5854.66s)]
*  That happened beginning in 1989 that affected every demographic group [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5861.18s)]
*  at from Cubans and kibis gain to [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5866.46s)]
*  Inuit and Homer Alaska everybody in between [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5870.22s)]
*  and that [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5873.42s)]
*  You know that affected boys at a four to one ratio to girls [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5875.18s)]
*  There has to be a chemical that does that so or some other exposure now [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5878.6s)]
*  There's a scientist called Phil Landrigan [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5882.76s)]
*  He narrowed it down to 11 things one [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5885.88s)]
*  Life-as-aid which is roundup. Oh, yeah around [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5890.4400000000005s)]
*  Something that suddenly exploded around 1989. Yeah [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5894.4400000000005s)]
*  It could be PFOA [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5898.6s)]
*  Which are flame retardants which became ubiquitous around that same time. I could be cell phones [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5901.08s)]
*  It could be ultrasound. It could be neonicotoid pesticides [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5907.280000000001s)]
*  It could be corn syrup [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5912.76s)]
*  There's a limited number of things it can be right, right? [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5914.92s)]
*  And it's an easy thing to do the science to figure out which one it is and we haven't done it [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5918.4400000000005s)]
*  And Tony Fauci hasn't done it but all of these neurodevelopmental autoimmune and um [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5923.4800000000005s)]
*  And allergic diseases that suddenly exploded in 1989 [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5929.72s)]
*  Our business all of them are also listed [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5933.96s)]
*  As side effects of vaccine on the manufacturer's insert of the 72 vaccine we went [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5937.24s)]
*  I was again, I got three vaccines my kids got 72 vaccines [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5943.64s)]
*  And it changed in 89 [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5948.52s)]
*  Vaccines have to be on that list a whole lot and there's a lot of science that says that's what's causing it including [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5950.84s)]
*  1999 cdc study called the first rat and study that they never released but we got a hold of it [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5959.46s)]
*  They looked at the biggest database in the country the vaccine safety data link [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5965.08s)]
*  It looked at kids who got the hepatitis b vaccine during the first 30 days [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5969.96s)]
*  And compared it to kids who did not get it or got it after 30 days and here's what they found [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5974.44s)]
*  The kids who got it had an 1135 [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5980.68s)]
*  Greater chance of getting on autism [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5984.52s)]
*  Autism diagnosis than kids who did not and that is pretty strong evidence [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5987.08s)]
*  What do you think is a solution then to kind of where we're at now? [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5993.0s)]
*  You feel like anthony falchi shouldn't be in his space. No, he should he should be in prison [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=5996.12s)]
*  but [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=6001.72s)]
*  The solution is really with all of us. We need to resist [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=6003.4s)]
*  We need you know, nobody ever complied their way out of totalitarian rule [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=6007.08s)]
*  We've seen our bill of rights obliterated. We're seeing a level of totalitarianism that is unprecedented [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=6012.84s)]
*  And you know what but it's not just america's across all the liberal democracies in the world [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=6019.48s)]
*  And all the powers these governments have accumulated over the last [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=6024.12s)]
*  To tell you to not do your business to not go to church to stay in your house to put on a mask to do what you're told [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=6027.72s)]
*  There's no government in history [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=6035.56s)]
*  That has ever relinquished power once it got it without a demand [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=6038.28s)]
*  We need to start demanding that our government [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=6043.08s)]
*  That we're not going to comply anymore and all of us have to [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=6046.76s)]
*  All of us have to [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=6050.2s)]
*  What I tell people is you need to do three civil disobedience a day and that could be just talking to your neighbor and [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=6052.679999999999s)]
*  educating them it could be telling somebody in your local store who has a [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=6059.54s)]
*  Don't come in if you don't have a mask sign [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=6063.88s)]

*  Yeah. Oh wow, man. That's awesome. Yeah, it all goes to fund our litigation and um [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNjr4WEY1ao&t=6080.28s)]
