*  Yes, sir. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=191.6s)]
*  And is it kind of your new movie? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=192.48000000000002s)]
*  Is it kind of like, um, is it like, what's the, is it a 12 years, a slave type of thing? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=194.32s)]
*  Is it a, like a Lincoln lawyer? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=198.20000000000002s)]
*  Like what's the, what's the arc of it? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=200.8s)]
*  You know, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=204.24s)]
*  which is like a serious slavery drama that won Oscars for the Lincoln lawyer, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=207.32s)]
*  just the middle of the road, Matthew McConnaghey entertaining movie. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=212.04000000000002s)]
*  I think it's, which are, they're both good movies, by the way. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=216.84s)]
*  That's pretty good. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=218.92000000000002s)]
*  Your slave is a little long. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=220.24s)]
*  They could have done it. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=221.12s)]
*  Maybe done in eight years. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=222.32s)]
*  Nine years. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=223.24s)]
*  Seven minutes slaves. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=226.44s)]
*  We didn't need to see all 12 of the years. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=229.84s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=231.44s)]
*  Come on. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=231.92000000000002s)]
*  We kind of get how this goes. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=234.8s)]
*  We get it. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=236.52s)]
*  Um, but yeah, what's the story arc? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=237.60000000000002s)]
*  You know, like what, yeah, what do we expect it? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=239.36s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=240.84s)]
*  So it's, it's way less, um, way, way smaller for budget than those two. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=241.24s)]
*  Honestly, the movie is, I just love dumb ass comedies. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=247.24s)]
*  Like the stuff we grew up on, like the Sandler, you know, spade Farley, you [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=251.16000000000003s)]
*  know, to Will Ferrell, to all that stuff that was just like silly as shit. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=255.96s)]
*  Good. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=259.88s)]
*  You know, like the first movie I was obsessed with was Billy Madison, right? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=260.28000000000003s)]
*  And just like goofy, technically a premise, but it's like, would [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=264.04s)]
*  this ever happen in real life? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=268.68s)]
*  No, but we just need it's there to just as like a skeleton for jokes. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=270.16s)]
*  And let's get goofy. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=274.36s)]
*  Let's get silly. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=275.28s)]
*  Let's get a bunch of funny people in it. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=276.0s)]
*  And that's what this movie is, dude. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=278.16s)]
*  It was like, I just wanted, you know, I wanted the opportunity to make something [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=279.24s)]
*  that I loved and like, I don't consider myself an actor, I'm a comic and comedy [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=283.8s)]
*  movies, I think are an extension of just like, I'm not trying to make a good ass [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=289.68s)]

*  Well, someone's handicapped something. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=330.64s)]
*  And I remember somebody was trying to do the life of Jesse bridges to Terabithia [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=332.0s)]
*  and adolescent changes when he befriends Leslie, the class outside of the children [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=337.56s)]
*  created in measuring a world called Terabithia, which is inhabited by all manner [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=340.92s)]

*  like towards the end, they all kind of had weird lessons [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=444.59999999999997s)]
*  or they just kind of got like even 40 year old Virgin. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=447.2s)]
*  It's weirdly like an allegory for virginity. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=449.44s)]
*  And like, fine, saving yourself from it. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=452.71999999999997s)]

*  some stuff that doesn't even make you laugh. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=489.47999999999996s)]
*  Like, what is this about or whatever? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=491.08s)]
*  And then like everybody at the end is kind of like handicapped [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=493.08s)]
*  or something like that. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=496.59999999999997s)]
*  And you're like, what is this? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=497.28s)]

*  Yeah, what is this? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=501.68s)]

*  or something, you know. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=519.96s)]

*  It's stupid. I get to make movies, but that's what I want to fucking do. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=628.76s)]
*  And instead of just like being broke and trying to be an actor and all this [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=632.5999999999999s)]
*  other shit, it was like, I know at least some people will see it. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=635.3599999999999s)]

*  So I don't know, man, I just think it's cool. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=654.64s)]
*  And it would be sick if people just started doing that shit. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=656.52s)]
*  If you started doing whatever you're passionate about because you have this [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=659.52s)]
*  fan base and you've built your own thing and yeah, tires is like that. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=663.12s)]

*  That was once something amazing about tires. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=668.16s)]
*  It was like you heard jokes on there for the first time. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=669.76s)]
*  There was jokes about everybody. Yeah. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=671.84s)]
*  And it was just normal stuff you would probably hear [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=673.4399999999999s)]
*  at a very alarming rubber shop. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=676.8s)]

*  You know what I mean? I want to see shit from everybody. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=688.76s)]

*  Everybody gets to make their own shit. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=693.04s)]
*  So that's what my version of that is just like a goofy ass. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=694.36s)]
*  Let's start a cult. Let's start a cult. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=699.0s)]

*  How do you all figure that out? [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=719.8800000000001s)]
*  I don't actually know, but hopefully low. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=720.72s)]
*  I'm trying to get it out there. I was trying. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=723.1600000000001s)]
*  I was trying to get there. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=724.76s)]
*  And what do you mean low? You took a 999. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=725.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, probably maybe lower even than that. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=728.44s)]
*  Well, that's yeah. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=729.9200000000001s)]

*  If somebody's like, I can get this, I can get some McNuggets. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=736.08s)]

*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=742.84s)]

*  It was like the Jim Carrey. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=760.0s)]
*  Oh, I forgot that he was Batman. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=762.08s)]

*  That movie was fucking awesome. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=785.76s)]
*  And the one after with Mr. Freeze was even more awesome. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=787.16s)]
*  They had Joel Schumacher, who was just like the gayest guy of all time. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=790.04s)]
*  He's the man. He's a great director, but he made it fun as shit. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=794.0s)]
*  Like, those movies sucked coming off the Tim Burton Batmans [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=797.0799999999999s)]
*  because they were like went from dark and like moody and kind of cool [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=799.88s)]

*  I don't believe so. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=950.76s)]
*  When did condoms really start? [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=952.04s)]
*  I had them, but they weren't using them. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=953.4s)]
*  You think there was like a luxury good. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=955.56s)]
*  It was like a fancy thing. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=957.8s)]
*  They probably had like I bet you like cavemen were like [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=959.3199999999999s)]
*  putting their dick in like sheep's like intestines, not to have killed [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=963.84s)]
*  children at a certain point. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=967.92s)]
*  Oh, just to get it out of their system. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=969.36s)]
*  I think they just figured out condoms pretty quick. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=971.04s)]
*  Like condoms have been used for centuries, but became more popular [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=973.2s)]
*  at different times for different reasons. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=976.64s)]
*  18th century condoms became more well known and the market grew [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=978.5999999999999s)]
*  despite opposition, opposition to condoms. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=982.88s)]
*  That was the first time the church was like, this is unnatural. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=985.68s)]
*  I absolutely. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=989.1999999999999s)]
*  The church was against them. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=990.28s)]
*  I promise you the church against them because every they got a nut. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=991.4s)]
*  The whole point of life is procreation. Right. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=994.76s)]
*  So for them and Mother Nature was probably against it. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=997.4399999999999s)]
*  Nature has to be because nature wants things to have sex. Sure. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1000.0s)]
*  Right. That's what nature needs that. Yeah. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1005.0799999999999s)]
*  So I wonder if nature put that in the minds of people like we can't stop it. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1007.36s)]
*  Yes. You mean like like Mother Nature planted that thought into your head [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1011.52s)]
*  or she's not going to let that not like that's her only goal. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1016.48s)]
*  Right. It's just smash and party. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1020.0s)]
*  But is it is it people because people were doing her harm. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1021.96s)]
*  Maybe Mother Nature wanted condoms so rabbits so rabbits and plants [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1025.0s)]
*  and shit could fuck and bring back the because we're fucking polluting, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1029.72s)]
*  especially this is the 18th century. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1034.6799999999998s)]
*  Mother Nature, probably she was the Industrial Revolution happened. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1036.52s)]
*  We start polluting shit. Yeah. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1039.8799999999999s)]
*  She's like, these motherfuckers are no good. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1041.32s)]
*  Yeah. You got to get we got to get them out. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1043.04s)]
*  We got to get them nutting inside of plastic bags inside of pussies [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1044.56s)]
*  instead of free and clear. Yeah, that's a good point. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1048.9199999999998s)]
*  You know, yeah. It started to become sort of this. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1051.52s)]
*  Look at this. It was like blue blockers for [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1055.32s)]
*  a purse for sex, you know, a 19th century. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1058.4799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. Go on. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1062.32s)]
*  Would you say we're going to say despite opposition, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1062.96s)]
*  they were sold in pubs, theaters and barbershops [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1064.52s)]
*  when the lineup so crispy, you know, you're going to get. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1068.28s)]
*  Like now, this that's that's a good marketing ploy. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1074.72s)]
*  It is. You're going to need one of these. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1077.56s)]
*  I like you. So nice. Yeah. Good day, sir. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1079.52s)]
*  And then you get a bad cut and the guy's like, you know, I get it. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1082.96s)]
*  I will say we have eight for the whole city. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1086.24s)]
*  And by the way, wash it out and tie it back up when you're done. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1090.12s)]
*  These things are expensive. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1093.8799999999999s)]
*  I know you see them on the clothesline. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1096.56s)]
*  Those are the days. Don't not in it too much. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1100.76s)]
*  Hey, come on over. I stole my neighbor's condom. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1105.08s)]
*  Yeah, we'll go have one. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1107.6399999999999s)]
*  Go and have one of condom with your boy tonight. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1108.9199999999998s)]
*  Tonight, Judy, like, dude, jack off before you fuck. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1110.8s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I don't want the first night of the day going in this thing. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1114.56s)]
*  We need the second week or one goes in this one. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1118.36s)]
*  We got it. We got to. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1121.48s)]
*  We got to keep the foundation intact on this. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1123.8s)]
*  Thanks. Yeah. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1125.6399999999999s)]
*  The thing can handle it can handle about seven. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1127.24s)]
*  Yes, it's not rated for the first night of the day loads. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1130.44s)]
*  It's not rated for that. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1134.32s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1137.04s)]
*  And then 19th century, it says rubber condoms became popular. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1137.9199999999998s)]
*  However, condom use was mainly limited to the upper class due to a lack [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1141.44s)]
*  of sexual education in the working class as well. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1145.8s)]
*  That makes sense. Oh, for sure. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1148.8s)]
*  Like these people can barely, you know, if this guy's [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1150.32s)]
*  making shoes all day, he's cobbling, he's cobbling or or would cobbling [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1153.56s)]
*  be like a hierarchy job you think? [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1158.24s)]
*  Oh, you like you mean you mean they're in the shoe factory. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1160.96s)]
*  The cobbler is kind of a an artisan bespoke. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1164.12s)]
*  Yes, artisan. You're right. Yeah, yeah. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1167.8799999999999s)]
*  He's probably somewhere in between the two 19th century. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1169.36s)]
*  So we're talking the 1800s. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1172.08s)]
*  You still got both. You still got cobbler's and shoe factory workers. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1173.64s)]
*  They wouldn't let them have condoms. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1176.6000000000001s)]
*  It's a little bit of both, I would say, where it's like the education [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1178.8000000000002s)]
*  keeps them not understanding how useful is. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1181.2800000000002s)]
*  So the working class has kids, working class women have to have kids earlier. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1183.4s)]
*  They're trapped. They don't get to fucking, you know, I mean, it's a classic thing. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1187.92s)]
*  The working class always gets tricked in this fucking it in all of human history. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1192.0800000000002s)]
*  While the fucking the barons fucking suck. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1196.48s)]
*  You know what I mean? They're on their fucking couches. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1199.8000000000002s)]
*  They're on the chaise lounges. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1201.6000000000001s)]
*  Yes. The factory workers, they don't know any better. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1203.08s)]
*  But then they're just letting them have sex and make more factory workers, [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1207.6399999999999s)]
*  which seems bizarre. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1210.6s)]
*  Well, that's good for, again, the upper classes. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1212.4399999999998s)]
*  They want disposable working class people in shitty living conditions. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1215.1599999999999s)]
*  What do they care? Right. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1219.1599999999999s)]
*  And so if people have more kids, it keeps them in poverty because then [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1220.0s)]
*  they have to spend a picture of the children. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1223.3999999999999s)]
*  And they get more workers and then wages go lower. Right. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1225.36s)]
*  So, you know, keep them going. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1228.8s)]
*  Keep condoms just for the rich. Yeah. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1230.8799999999999s)]
*  Condoms in 1950s and 1960s, condoms became a popular birth control method [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1233.36s)]
*  with 42 percent of Americans of reproductive age using them for birth control [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1237.52s)]
*  between 1955 and 65. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1242.32s)]
*  So that's about when we're to bring a full circle. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1244.1599999999999s)]
*  That's when Batman, I believe the first Batman was shot. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1246.24s)]
*  So they probably mixed it up. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1250.04s)]
*  They probably had gone. But those guys look like raw doggers to me. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1251.8799999999999s)]
*  I think Adam West. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1256.24s)]
*  Can we do a little research on Adam West's sexual history? [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1257.56s)]
*  Yeah, bring that up. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1260.28s)]
*  I think Adam West and Burgess Meredith, they're old school guys. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1261.84s)]
*  They're not putting on condoms unless absolutely necessary. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1265.4399999999998s)]
*  What do you say? Well, look at this. Adam West. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1269.3999999999999s)]
*  His stories of romantic conquest, including the infamous night with eight women. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1272.32s)]
*  Wow. Have become the. Yeah. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1276.0s)]
*  This man's sort of lore surrounding his life and career. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1277.52s)]
*  While some might view West candid revelations with a mixture of astonishment [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1279.56s)]
*  and disbelief, they also offer a glimpse into the complexities [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1282.8799999999999s)]
*  of living under the spotlight. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1285.8s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, wow. Sounds bad. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1287.72s)]
*  Real tough. Got the fucking suck before smartphones. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1290.04s)]
*  Yeah. Lord knows what Adam West was up to. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1293.76s)]
*  There was no way he was. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1295.92s)]
*  Well, he had that bat phone, didn't he? Sure. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1297.1599999999999s)]
*  He used to. Hey, what's that? [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1301.32s)]
*  He used it to get head. Oh, Mayor. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1302.68s)]
*  Give me the woman with the largest tits in Gotham. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1304.8799999999999s)]

*  You've got it, Batman. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1310.56s)]
*  He just signs that bat light just across into his neighbor's apartment. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1312.48s)]
*  Fucking dick. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1315.8s)]
*  He has a bat light, but he also has a dick light. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1317.28s)]
*  Whether he's horny or not. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1320.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1323.04s)]
*  Bam. Yeah. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1325.92s)]
*  Squish. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1328.16s)]
*  The crazy part was when they would like the one like this or something. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1332.28s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, they would go up a wall. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1336.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. They're pretending to go up a wall and they literally just put the camera up [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1338.4s)]
*  sideways. Yeah. It's pretty fun to watch it. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1341.04s)]
*  Yeah. We need more stuff like that. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1343.56s)]
*  But, you know, we just need more stuff that's entertainment. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1345.2s)]
*  More goofy bullshit. Yeah. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1347.88s)]
*  And no, we did not have as much sex on the I don't. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1349.68s)]
*  Yeah. There are love three. Is there a love arc in there? [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1353.0s)]
*  There you know, I will say there is a there is a sex scene. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1355.28s)]
*  Really? There is a sex scene. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1358.52s)]
*  And it was probably my favorite. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1360.5600000000002s)]
*  I wrote the movie, like I said, with my friends. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1362.24s)]
*  And so of course, you write in a sex scene, dude. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1363.92s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1365.72s)]
*  I have acting class and I was just like we'd have to do scenes and stuff. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1367.3600000000001s)]
*  And I would always bring a scene where there's like possible making out. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1370.72s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1374.92s)]
*  Suppose it would just be like two people are walking and they're in an argument. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1375.72s)]
*  And then for no reason, they kiss or whatever. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1378.56s)]
*  You wrote it in chicks. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1381.56s)]
*  But I like this. Yeah. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1382.9599999999998s)]

*  Yeah, yeah, I think it was. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1413.08s)]
*  I mean, without hiding your phone on a cabinet across the room. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1414.3999999999999s)]
*  Without being like, oh, yeah, I don't know why that teddy bear is blinking red. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1419.8799999999999s)]
*  That's weird. Yeah, I'm going to go turn it off. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1424.3999999999999s)]
*  Then you just put a piece of black masking tape over it. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1427.36s)]
*  I'm trying to think because I will. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1433.28s)]
*  Yeah. How do you think? [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1435.24s)]
*  Was that a nervous day? [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1436.4s)]
*  It was weird, man. So, yeah, there is a sexiness. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1437.96s)]
*  And I don't want to spoil too much, but it's a wild one. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1439.88s)]
*  And I will say there there was an intimacy coordinator. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1442.88s)]
*  And that's the person I felt bad for the most, because this person's job is [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1447.3200000000002s)]
*  if you're ahead of a nude scene. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1451.16s)]
*  And so if you're nude, some lady has to put a little like [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1453.0s)]
*  rubber triangle around your dick and balls. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1458.4s)]
*  Really? One of those bibs you get at a crab joint. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1460.76s)]
*  It has it has a lobster with a fork and a knife in its claws printed on it. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1464.2s)]
*  It is honestly not that far off from that, though. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1470.0s)]
*  It is just like it's like a plastic thong, essentially. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1472.3200000000002s)]
*  No. And so you're naked that day. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1476.0800000000002s)]

*  OK. You know, that's you know. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1491.16s)]
*  And so I'm definitely nude. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1492.84s)]
*  And one and a woman has to tape, [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1494.9599999999998s)]
*  literally tape my dick and balls to this fucking thing. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1498.8s)]
*  Because you want to look naked, but you don't want if, you know, [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1502.9199999999998s)]
*  you don't want people to have to look at my dick the whole day. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1505.6799999999998s)]
*  You want to put like a plastic sheet over it. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1508.4399999999998s)]
*  But this woman's job, anytime that thing like slipped, she had to just like [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1510.1999999999998s)]

*  She had the same demeanor as just like a grizzled, you know, [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1527.6s)]
*  you're going to be fine. Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1530.84s)]

*  And I wanted you might never get a chance to make a movie again. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1546.8s)]
*  So it's like, let's fucking yeah, let's leave it all out there. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1549.56s)]

*  That's just a joke. Yeah. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1591.1599999999999s)]
*  One of my dear friends. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1592.56s)]
*  That's the classic racist thing to say. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1593.6399999999999s)]
*  My best friend is Albanian, which is actually true in my case. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1596.2399999999998s)]
*  But it's like the classic. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1599.7199999999998s)]
*  What was that? [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1602.6399999999999s)]
*  And what was the budget of the film? [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1603.4799999999998s)]
*  What does it cost? It was it was seven hundred fifty K. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1604.84s)]
*  Wow. Yeah. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1608.1599999999999s)]
*  So it was it started at like two hundred K. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1609.1599999999999s)]
*  And we did it with I want to say, you know, Dark Sky, [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1612.3999999999999s)]
*  Dark Sky Films, it's like it's a smaller production company. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1615.7199999999998s)]
*  They've actually they've done a lot of cool shit, [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1617.76s)]
*  a lot of cool horror movies and stuff, but lower budget stuff. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1619.76s)]
*  And they were just fucking awesome to work with. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1622.76s)]
*  They just saw a short that we did. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1625.12s)]
*  And they thought we were going to write like a one location [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1627.1999999999998s)]
*  because the short takes place in one place. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1630.0s)]
*  But we were like, you're going to let us make a movie. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1632.1599999999999s)]
*  We're going to fucking there's going to be wild shit in it. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1634.28s)]
*  And so we pretty much pushed it to the the amount [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1636.8s)]
*  because it's such a weird you also learn so much about this kind of shit [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1641.0s)]
*  where it's like if you go over what you learn, what was the number one thing [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1643.76s)]
*  you learned? You like, well, I mean, I interrupted you if you go over what? [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1646.6s)]
*  No, no. Like one of the things I learned is that like you can't really go over [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1650.04s)]
*  a certain budget because then everything becomes more expensive [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1653.3600000000001s)]
*  and you have to like you have to get like more just like for, [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1656.52s)]
*  you know, union reasons, you have to get more people involved. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1659.92s)]
*  It becomes like a harder job, whereas like the lower budget, [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1662.8s)]
*  you make a movie, they kind of allow you to like a lot of people [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1666.08s)]
*  can do different jobs. You can, you know, obviously you have to follow [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1669.12s)]
*  certain rules and you can't overwork people. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1671.6s)]
*  But there was basically like a limit where they're like, look, [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1673.3999999999999s)]
*  if you spend any more than this, we have to pay all the actors more. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1677.6799999999998s)]
*  We have to pay everybody else more. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1680.32s)]
*  And, you know, we pretty much lost. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1681.6399999999999s)]
*  I mean, I lost money. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1683.84s)]
*  So you put some of your money in. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1685.1999999999998s)]
*  No, but like just not work. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1686.6799999999998s)]
*  I took I like, oh, yeah, I like, yeah, you know what I mean? [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1688.52s)]
*  It was like, totally, totally. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1691.8s)]
*  And I'll probably lose money just like traveling to promote it [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1694.3600000000001s)]
*  and stuff like that. But again, who gives a fuck? [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1697.2s)]
*  It's about making cool shit. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1699.64s)]
*  And it's like, I'm not starting for money. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1701.2s)]
*  And so you just learn a bunch of, you know, and you also think like, [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1703.48s)]
*  you think a movie is going to be like this fucking actor is fucking talking [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1707.88s)]
*  about each scene and shit like that. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1711.8s)]
*  They're like, dude, we have fucking 12 minutes to get this. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1714.1200000000001s)]
*  And, oh, it's actually the most crucial scene in the movie. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1717.52s)]
*  Well, yeah, good luck. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1719.72s)]
*  And this dog has to be asleep in a half hour. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1722.48s)]
*  And you're like, what? [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1724.96s)]
*  We're putting the dog down. Yeah. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1726.3600000000001s)]
*  We're putting the dog down unless you nail this scene. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1727.96s)]
*  I'm like, huh? Yeah. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1730.2s)]
*  Yeah, it's just cheaper to put him down. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1732.48s)]
*  Union rules. I don't know, bro. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1734.0800000000002s)]
*  Either nail the scene or the fucking shit suit gets it. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1735.8400000000001s)]
*  Oh, I didn't want to kill a dog. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1739.52s)]
*  You shouldn't have fucked with the team. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1741.92s)]
*  You know, right. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1744.48s)]
*  You think you'd be able to make your money back? [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1747.3200000000002s)]
*  I think so. We did pretty well. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1748.68s)]
*  You know, we didn't do crazy. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1750.36s)]
*  We had we had a release in theaters just because I just think it's important. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1752.36s)]
*  Yeah, no, I think this is that's what's amazing about it. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1756.08s)]
*  It's this, you know, like we had Kevin Smith on and he's done this. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1759.24s)]
*  Yeah. But now it's certainly that there are creators that have their own world [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1762.56s)]
*  and they want to make a film sometimes. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1768.32s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1770.32s)]
*  Me and Spade wrote a movie and we have a chance to do it. Right. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1771.1599999999999s)]
*  And so we're finally going to do it. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1773.6s)]
*  It just took forever to get it together. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1776.04s)]
*  And like nobody in Hollywood wants to finance or anything. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1777.6799999999998s)]
*  But it's cool to see people just making their own stuff. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1780.32s)]
*  And so, yeah, dude, that's why I called you even last week. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1782.6399999999999s)]
*  And I was like, hey, tell me about this. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1784.8799999999999s)]
*  I just want to know because it's just brave. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1786.1599999999999s)]
*  You're trying something. Thanks, man. Yeah. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1788.8s)]
*  And it's and it's what you want to do. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1790.48s)]
*  Nobody can kind of tell you what's supposed to be on the script. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1793.48s)]
*  The only limitation was budget. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1796.24s)]
*  And for me, I think that's so much that's so much cooler. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1798.1599999999999s)]
*  And you get to actually be an artist about it, not to fucking suck my own dick. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1801.32s)]
*  It's a movie about, you know, a fat guy and you see my nuts in it. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1804.9199999999998s)]
*  It's not like I'm fucking again. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1808.3999999999999s)]
*  We're not making both your nuts in the movie. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1809.76s)]
*  I will also mention this. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1812.12s)]
*  They didn't let me show my real nuts, which is a big problem for me. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1813.32s)]
*  Well, how much is the nuts looked little and I have pretty nice nuts foundation. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1816.92s)]
*  I have a nice foundation. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1821.84s)]
*  Truly, the dick is more of an ornamental piece. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1823.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's like the little star at the top. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1825.8799999999999s)]
*  The dick is the nose, the lung. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1828.72s)]
*  The dick is the nose. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1831.0s)]
*  The nuts are the lungs. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1832.96s)]
*  Absolutely. They go deep. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1834.8s)]
*  They go deep. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1836.96s)]
*  They go deep and they're full. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1838.36s)]
*  Deep breath, let's just say. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1839.8400000000001s)]
*  Lungs of the heavens. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1841.24s)]
*  I got Michael Phelps's lungs. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1842.5600000000002s)]
*  Nice capacity on those lungs. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1845.52s)]
*  Nose, not so much. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1847.44s)]
*  Cute little button nose. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1848.76s)]
*  Michael. Yeah, dude. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1849.8400000000001s)]
*  More of a, yeah, it's nothing a snowman would love. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1852.24s)]
*  It's not a Michael Imperiali nose. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1854.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's very, it's almost like a burn victim nose. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1856.28s)]
*  Yeah, right, right, right, right, right. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1860.72s)]

*  look, we'll do our best. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1868.76s)]
*  Yeah, it's kind of a Voldemort situation. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1873.64s)]
*  Kind of more of a cat's nose. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1878.88s)]
*  I've got a penis like a cat's nose, you know? [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1881.68s)]

*  which is a prop. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1912.48s)]
*  But again, these are the artistic sacrifices [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1913.48s)]
*  we have to make sometimes. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1915.76s)]
*  Yeah, you know, on Prop 24, you know, whatever. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1916.76s)]

*  Nuts are the fucking. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1930.04s)]
*  They show. OK. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1931.9599999999998s)]

*  I bet you he's tucked them underneath his ass. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1940.0s)]
*  You have to almost tie them in your ass. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1943.04s)]
*  There is. There is. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1944.76s)]

*  We're not going to go. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1964.92s)]
*  We're talking about what my body should be on the on the nuts. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=1965.88s)]

*  Yeah, which doesn't happen. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2002.92s)]

*  it's obviously my movie. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2037.8000000000002s)]
*  I believe it. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2038.5600000000002s)]
*  I believe in it a lot. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2039.88s)]
*  But it's like any time creative people that you like make shit outside of a system. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2040.84s)]
*  I think it's kind of important to go support that shit. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2045.72s)]
*  Yeah. Well, it's kind of like a new realm, you know, and also [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2048.2799999999997s)]
*  some movies that are billion dollar movies are horrible. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2052.0s)]
*  There was one Ryan Gosling with my mom and I went and saw horrible. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2054.6s)]
*  Yeah, I went and saw something the other night. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2059.12s)]
*  It was a chance in time or something. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2061.08s)]
*  Can you look it up for me? [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2064.2799999999997s)]
*  We live in time. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2065.52s)]
*  There you go. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2068.16s)]
*  Well, here's what I don't know. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2069.8799999999997s)]
*  Is that bad? [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2071.8399999999997s)]
*  That looks I like those actors. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2072.2s)]
*  It was sweet. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2073.6s)]
*  It was cute. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2074.8399999999997s)]
*  But every shot was so close on their faces. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2075.24s)]
*  After a while, you're like, where's all the money they spent on set? [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2078.4399999999996s)]
*  You can't even see the set. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2082.3599999999997s)]
*  So what starts to happen for me, I notice in movies is they shoot things so tight [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2083.56s)]
*  nowadays, right? Like it's just this. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2087.6s)]
*  Yeah. Right. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2090.0s)]
*  And your brain, there's no like your imagination. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2091.16s)]
*  If there's more going on, your imagination has to process things on the screen. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2094.72s)]
*  So your imagination is interested in what's going on. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2100.0s)]
*  But if there's nothing to even really think about, it's so dumb down. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2103.2s)]
*  Everything is this tight. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2107.4399999999996s)]
*  You're not you're just kind of like you just start to lose interest [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2109.3199999999997s)]
*  because I think there's a part of you that's not working. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2112.7999999999997s)]
*  You know, it's like when they shoot comedies now, it's like they shoot [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2114.7999999999997s)]
*  everything so tight and it's just about you don't you don't see people's body [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2117.24s)]
*  language, they just I feel like they miss out on a lot of things. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2121.8399999999997s)]
*  Just because they think we need it to be so simple. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2125.04s)]
*  Yeah, well, I think that is another thing that I learned about movies, [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2128.68s)]
*  which I didn't think about at all, is that it is such a visual. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2131.56s)]
*  You think it's about the writing, you think it's about your jokes, [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2135.12s)]
*  especially being a comic, you're like, it's all about the writing. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2137.16s)]
*  It's all about the jokes. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2139.8799999999997s)]
*  And you don't think about like it's a visual medium. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2140.68s)]
*  It's like a bunch of interesting pictures strung together. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2142.8799999999997s)]
*  Ultimately is what it is. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2146.64s)]
*  And it was interesting to like, like talk to our cinematographer [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2147.9599999999996s)]
*  and a scene that I thought was like pretty straightforward, [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2151.64s)]
*  just two people talking kind of what you're describing, just faces. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2153.72s)]
*  He's like, no, let's fucking play it. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2156.64s)]
*  Why don't you guys lean on the car? [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2159.0s)]
*  Why don't we make it a little more interesting? [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2160.24s)]
*  And like that was a fucking sick part of it to like, yeah, [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2161.7999999999997s)]
*  because you don't think about that. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2165.2799999999997s)]
*  I just think about the jokes and I just think about my words getting laughs. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2166.24s)]
*  And then it's cool to watch a movie and be like, oh, you just do something [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2169.8399999999997s)]
*  with your face and that's a laugh and you just fucking you run funny. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2173.12s)]
*  And that's a laugh. You know what I mean? [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2176.9199999999996s)]
*  And it's like that was a cool thing. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2178.24s)]
*  Again, I love comedy so much and I'm just trying to figure out [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2179.64s)]
*  every way to be funny. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2182.8s)]
*  And I think like, yeah, what you're saying of like making it interesting, [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2184.2000000000003s)]
*  having the visuals being really interesting, that's a huge, a huge. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2188.2400000000002s)]
*  Again, it's a cool learning experience. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2192.28s)]
*  And that's what I I don't know if you feel this way, but it's like [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2194.1200000000003s)]
*  that's the nice thing about. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2197.5600000000004s)]
*  Oh, yeah. About like learning you shit is just how can we be funny? [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2199.1200000000003s)]
*  And like the time I felt the most engaged in my life was like [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2203.44s)]
*  when I was an open mic or learning how to do comedy. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2207.92s)]
*  And it's cool to get the chance to make a movie and like feel like, [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2210.44s)]
*  I don't know, Dick, I'm a fucking dumb as shit. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2213.7599999999998s)]
*  Like, let's figure out how to how to make all this stuff. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2216.72s)]
*  I'm a recovering Greek. Yeah. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=2219.68s)]

*  You couldn't turn it off. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=3870.52s)]
*  So you had to just siphon gas. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=3872.04s)]
*  No, you have to keep putting gas. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=3874.68s)]

*  It was so hard to get back on. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=3882.68s)]
*  So we would just we keep like extra cans of gas at the fucking parking space. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=3884.8399999999997s)]
*  We had an underground parking space. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=3888.68s)]
*  Yeah, that was it. But it was a green one. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=3891.3599999999997s)]

*  Not that green. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=3898.3999999999996s)]
*  That is very. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=3900.12s)]
*  More of a seafoam. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=3902.2s)]

*  But yeah, we get the idea. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=3915.4s)]
*  Yeah. But that bitch, [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=3916.84s)]
*  we would keep a couple cans of gas because it got great mileage. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=3919.8s)]
*  You could fucking keep it going. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=3922.6s)]

*  I'd drive that bitch. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=3931.92s)]
*  Loyola where? In New Orleans? [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=3933.4s)]
*  And since you kept it running, people didn't. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=3936.52s)]
*  You could park in a weird spot and be like, other guys just [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=3938.36s)]
*  coming and going. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=3941.36s)]

*  No one stole it, huh? [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=3979.96s)]
*  No. They respected the eclipse. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=3981.6s)]
*  I guess. I mean, sometimes I'll put the plasters on. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=3984.0s)]
*  I think it's like there's a lot of reverse psychology there, you know, [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=3986.08s)]

*  But I always lived for cheap, man. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=4068.68s)]
*  I slept in my buddy's bed for probably seven months out in Los Angeles. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=4070.4s)]
*  When I first got out there, I lived in this little cupboard that was in a living room. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=4076.08s)]
*  They have a cupboard doors and it was like four or three feet high. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=4080.64s)]
*  Four feet wide. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=4085.12s)]
*  Just the bed? [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=4086.2400000000002s)]
*  No, there was no bed in there. It was just a floor. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=4087.32s)]
*  Right. But it was long and it was like probably eight feet deep. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=4089.08s)]
*  So it's perfect. I'm going to bed. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=4093.16s)]

*  And sometimes I come out right on the hour, you know. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=4098.28s)]
*  But I was always sharing, dude, I slept on my buddy's floor for one hundred [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=4105.32s)]
*  fifty dollars in college and a sleeping bag and I fucking yelled at him, complained about shit. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=4108.04s)]
*  But he needed the money. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=4112.92s)]
*  So it's fucking funny. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=4114.12s)]
*  I did the same. I similarly I convinced my friends to give me a shitty room in their house in Baltimore. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=4117.92s)]
*  I live for three hundred bucks a month. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=4123.92s)]
*  I had a room. They were just like I was literally living on the my go to meal was beans and eggs on one. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=4127.08s)]
*  I would bake them and put them on one sheet. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=4133.68s)]
*  And that way I could just use the sheet as my plate. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=4135.88s)]
*  I wouldn't have to do dishes. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=4139.8s)]

*  It doesn't sound, I got to be honest, it does not sound appealing. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=4427.48s)]
*  Fletcha. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=4430.5199999999995s)]
*  Sounds too much like flesh. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=4431.5199999999995s)]
*  Fletcha? [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=4433.32s)]
*  Yeah, I've heard it's a regular person, like I'm going to Fletcha. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=4434.32s)]
*  Fletcha Cantina? [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=4436.68s)]

*  He's done some interesting things. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=4441.0s)]
*  You know, he had an alcohol, but then he said he didn't drink and then he came out with a [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=4442.0s)]
*  tequila, which I thought was kind of wild. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=4444.84s)]
*  Interesting, interesting. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=4446.5199999999995s)]
*  What do you think that's about? [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=4447.8s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=4448.8s)]
*  I think it was just when celebrities were coming out with tequilas. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=4449.8s)]
*  It was purely a business move. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=4452.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, like when George Clooney came out with one. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=4453.72s)]
*  One time I was in Toronto, I'm sitting there, it's like probably 1230 or something, you [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=4455.320000000001s)]

*  In the lobby at 1230 on your computer. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=4465.0s)]
*  Desperate for attention. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=4468.24s)]
*  Probably. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=4469.24s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=4470.24s)]
*  That's fucking awesome. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=4471.24s)]
*  I can't remember why. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=4472.24s)]
*  After a show, you're just there. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=4473.24s)]
*  I think I was doing shows, yeah. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=4475.88s)]
*  Gotcha. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=4476.96s)]
*  I was just hanging out because, yeah, it's funny after shows you don't want to go to [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=4477.96s)]
*  like bars and shit. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=4482.04s)]
*  Yeah, it's like you go to a bar, you're going to see a lot of people in the show, it's going [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=4483.04s)]
*  to be overwhelming. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=4485.8s)]
*  Definitely. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=4486.8s)]
*  And then if I don't drink, it's hard to be there. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=4487.8s)]
*  So it's like you don't there's nowhere usually to go. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=4488.88s)]
*  Sure. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=4491.12s)]
*  No, that's true. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=4492.12s)]

*  But if he was just a nice little goat, Vanessa Shakib. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6604.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's tough to know the goat was seized by sheriffs. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6608.8s)]
*  Go back to the top a little bit. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6612.9s)]
*  Sheriff's deputies in 2022 while living at a North Carolina farm [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6614.2s)]
*  and was later slaughtered. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6617.3s)]
*  Why did they eat him as outlined in court documents? [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6619.1s)]
*  You can't slaughter a goat for no reason. [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6622.9s)]
*  For no reason. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6625.3s)]
*  No, not for no fucking reason. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6626.0s)]
*  But if you look, if they had a nice little. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6627.6s)]
*  Like, nah, we're getting this guy out of here. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6628.5s)]
*  And the goat just like the sheriff's deputy did nothing then enforce [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6632.3s)]
*  the law. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6637.2s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6637.5s)]
*  Who knows if this is you, right? [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6638.2s)]
*  And then they got this squirrel or whatever. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6640.5s)]
*  He did something some dumb bitch snitched. [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6642.2s)]
*  They shouldn't have killed peanut, but the bitch who snitched is [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6644.4s)]
*  obviously the biggest villain in here, but also the cops overstepping [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6647.3s)]
*  cops love killing a fucking animal when they can man. [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6650.8s)]
*  They do. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6653.8s)]
*  They'll shoot people's dogs for no reason. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6654.3s)]
*  They just fucking like killing shit. [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6656.5s)]
*  Yeah, he had a gun. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6658.2s)]

*  Because I know there's the election, right? [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6672.8s)]
*  Yes. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6676.0s)]
*  Do you think what are people truly scared of? [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6676.3s)]
*  Do you think when they talk about Trump? [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6679.099999999999s)]
*  Because but what is it? [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6681.099999999999s)]
*  I kind of start to wonder what do people be scared of? [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6682.2s)]
*  I can tell you right. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6685.7s)]
*  I mean the thing so for me, you know, I didn't love either [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6687.0s)]
*  candidate here. [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6690.9s)]
*  I didn't I really didn't understand being enthusiastic about either [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6691.7s)]
*  candidate. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6696.6s)]
*  I think, you know, I'm not a Trump guy. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6697.1s)]
*  Obviously, I think he is dangerous and the things that I'm scared [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6700.4s)]
*  of the most and the thing that made me that made me lean towards [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6703.2s)]
*  Kamala was more than anything was the Supreme Court and that it [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6706.3s)]
*  would be if it's put under like far right control for the [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6710.9s)]
*  next however long we've already seen, you know, women's right to [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6716.8s)]
*  you know over their bodies the abortion, you know Roe v. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6720.5s)]
*  Wade's been overturned which I think is really dangerous. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6723.3s)]
*  That's going to like really affect women's health care already [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6726.0s)]
*  in states that banned it. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6729.900000000001s)]
*  You see they're getting less just general OBGYN care because [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6730.900000000001s)]
*  it's more dangerous to be a doctor in those states. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6734.7s)]
*  So we don't think about shit that trickles down. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6736.7s)]
*  So like it's harder to get just general health care, let alone [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6739.6s)]
*  abortion in Texas now for women. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6744.5s)]
*  And that's only going to get harder in rural states. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6746.6s)]
*  And I think for me that was the number one issue. [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6748.900000000001s)]
*  That's really fucking scary to me, especially with the border [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6751.1s)]
*  being open. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6753.6s)]
*  They're letting rapists in. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6753.900000000001s)]
*  It's you know, I'm saying though. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6755.0s)]
*  It's like you're just well, yeah, I mean, I don't know if it's [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6757.5s)]
*  the best time to repeal that. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6761.6s)]
*  Yeah, if we're going to follow your logic and you claim they [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6762.900000000001s)]
*  got rapists coming in, maybe we should also keep abortion. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6767.0s)]
*  But you know, I think we got plenty of homegrown rapists too. [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6770.8s)]
*  But yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, we got our own. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6774.2s)]
*  Sure, sure, sure. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6776.599999999999s)]
*  Union got it. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6777.5s)]
*  We've got some heirloom American rapists for sure. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6778.4s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6782.4s)]
*  But I think that's my the number one thing that scares me is [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6784.0s)]
*  about that because it's not only that's the first step. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6787.3s)]
*  And I think you can really see stuff that we take for granted [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6789.9s)]
*  is progress. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6792.8s)]
*  Gay marriage is another thing. [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6793.599999999999s)]
*  There's a really weird cultural. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6795.4s)]
*  I think this is what happens anytime the party that's backed [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6797.4s)]
*  by the, you know, the powers that be big business, the rich [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6802.1s)]
*  people, the richest people in the world want far-right politicians. [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6806.900000000001s)]
*  And I think if they still absolutely without question, I feel like [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6810.3s)]
*  tech is now I just got the party is a huge is a huge Trump. [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6814.8s)]
*  That's a good point. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6820.5s)]
*  I think rich people will support whoever's in power number one, [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6821.200000000001s)]
*  but they want to transfer wealth from the poor to the rich. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6824.6s)]
*  They've been really good at doing it. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6827.8s)]
*  The biggest issue. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6829.400000000001s)]
*  I think the reason the Democrats lost is because they pretend that [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6830.6s)]
*  there is no problem that it's like that's fucking crazy. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6834.8s)]
*  You have to tell people that yes, there are issues here. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6838.400000000001s)]
*  Shit is more expensive. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6842.0s)]
*  I think inflation. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6843.5s)]
*  I think a big a big part of inflation is that companies realize [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6844.400000000001s)]
*  they can just charge you more and say it's somebody else's fault. [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6848.3s)]
*  A lot of it's price gouging. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6850.8s)]
*  That's you know, that's fucking true. [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6852.3s)]
*  And the but you should everything. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6854.0s)]
*  It's so much more expensive. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6856.1s)]
*  And companies are some of it is just real inflation, but some of [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6857.1s)]
*  his companies are hiding behind inflation. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6860.7s)]
*  And like there was no Democrats did nothing to stop price gouging. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6862.9s)]
*  Right. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6866.7s)]
*  They didn't even say they were going to do it. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6867.0s)]
*  You can't tell people that things are going good when they're [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6868.9s)]
*  just clearly not. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6872.4s)]
*  And there were just no it sucks because they offered the Democratic [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6873.2s)]
*  Party has become like they were going after fucking dick Cheney [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6878.8s)]
*  and who's like, it's so bizarre. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6881.9s)]
*  It's crazy because they're going after policy-wise, you know, [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6884.6s)]
*  moderates Republican people who most working-class people don't [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6888.2s)]
*  agree with the economic stuff that they're saying and then culturally [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6892.9s)]
*  it's not it bothers me when you become a party of like tattletales. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6897.8s)]
*  It's like it's become a party of like middle managers that want to [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6903.0s)]
*  get mad at you if you say the wrong thing and it's like that's not [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6906.0s)]
*  fucking that's not the most important issue. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6910.2s)]
*  The most important issue for people is that things are fucking [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6912.6s)]
*  more they have no health care wage inequalities out of fucking [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6915.3s)]
*  control. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6919.4s)]
*  We're not the what people's wages have not kept pace with how much [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6919.8s)]
*  bosses are earning. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6923.9s)]
*  We have what percent of me Bernie Sanders said greatly that he [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6925.2s)]
*  thought if AI starts to happen for companies, right? [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6927.7s)]
*  So companies are making more money because they don't need people. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6930.8s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6934.0s)]
*  Then some of that money should go to the employees of course as [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6934.9s)]
*  opposed and cut it cut it down their hours for the week. [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6939.2s)]
*  Now you give them a better life instead of just making it where [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6941.7s)]
*  well fuck well, we don't need you anymore. [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=6945.099999999999s)]

*  I agree with you. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7406.3s)]
*  The president doesn't have that much power. [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7407.0s)]
*  And if it wasn't for the Supreme Court, I would be like [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7412.5s)]

*  The idea that he's different from politicians is crazy. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7436.8s)]
*  He's a rich guy who had... [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7439.400000000001s)]
*  You know, he grew up rich. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7441.2s)]
*  He's a class president for sure type. [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7442.3s)]
*  Yeah, and it's like his dad, you know, he was like his [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7443.900000000001s)]
*  dad was a fucking slumlord. [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7446.5s)]

*  I tend to not trust super rich guys and I don't see how [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7455.1s)]
*  he's going to do anything different. [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7458.7s)]
*  I think it's naive to think he's going to be different [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7460.3s)]
*  than... [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7462.3s)]
*  I understand not trusting the Democratic establishment, [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7463.1s)]
*  but it's like to me Trump's funny, but he is... [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7465.2s)]
*  He's a fucking billionaire propped up by other billionaires. [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7468.099999999999s)]
*  That's... [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7471.099999999999s)]
*  I think he's part of just the complex that runs our country [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7471.9s)]

*  He's already... [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7481.7s)]

*  Absolutely. [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7501.599999999999s)]

*  And when they... [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7510.799999999999s)]
*  That's what lost me as a Democrat. [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7511.4s)]

*  To heaven? [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7537.2s)]
*  It looks like he's just about to finish a fucking marathon. [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7539.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7542.5s)]
*  But he just got out of his car. [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7542.7s)]
*  And they're still pretending every day. [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7544.3s)]
*  He's the mayor. [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7545.5s)]
*  They just told him the other day, he's the fucking mayor of Wisconsin. [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7546.0s)]
*  And he's like... [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7549.3s)]
*  And they're giving him unlimited... [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7550.2s)]

*  Unlimited ice cream and milk. [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7552.6s)]
*  Well, and that's why I agree with you. [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7554.7s)]
*  I think they made a fucking huge mistake in running him again. [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7556.5s)]
*  Like when he ran the first time, it's like, I get it. [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7561.7s)]
*  People were scared of another thing of Trump. [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7563.6s)]
*  So like put some fucking, you know, put some middle of the road ass Democrat. [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7565.5s)]
*  But then they should have had an open primary. [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7570.5s)]
*  Like people could actually vote on the issues they care about. [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7572.8s)]

*  It'll be interesting. [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7608.1s)]
*  It's a lot of pressure to see. [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7608.8s)]
*  I'm most excited about RFK and JD Vance was super cool when he came on the podcast. [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7610.5s)]
*  He's a human. [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7617.0s)]
*  Trump's hard to get to know. [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7617.8s)]
*  I don't know that JD... [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7619.1s)]
*  To me, he seems like a traditional just say whatever it takes to get elected snake, to be honest with you. [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7620.0s)]
*  I know, you know, you had him on, he was cool here. [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7626.1s)]
*  But he was a guy who said he hated Trump. [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7627.7s)]
*  He said some fucked up shit about women. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7630.2s)]
*  Like, I just think he's a... [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7632.0s)]
*  And venture capitalist guys are fucking worms to begin with. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7633.5s)]
*  I don't trust JD Vance at all. [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7637.3s)]
*  I think he's a piece of shit also. [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7638.7s)]
*  Really? [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7640.3s)]

*  I mean, just... [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7641.8s)]
*  I think he's a cut in the... [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7642.8s)]
*  Regular ass Republican that'll say any fucking fucked up thing just to get into power. [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7644.5s)]
*  He sucked Trump's cock after saying he was... [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7649.9s)]
*  He called him Hitler or whatever. [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7652.099999999999s)]
*  And he made a complete turn when he realized it was politically advantageous to be on Trump's side. [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7653.9s)]
*  I think he also is just a run-of-the-mill piece of shit politician. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7659.7s)]
*  Like I just do. [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7664.5s)]
*  And that's the thing. [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7665.3s)]
*  I think all politicians is a weird thing to be, right? [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7665.9s)]
*  But that's what I'm saying. [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7669.5s)]
*  That's what I'm saying is like I've never been excited about... [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7670.599999999999s)]
*  The politicians I've been excited about was Obama when I was 18. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7673.7s)]
*  Same, I voted for Obama. [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7676.7s)]
*  And I think he did have a real opportunity to do something and it turned out he didn't really do shit. [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7677.9s)]
*  And then he did, man. [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7682.799999999999s)]
*  But that's the thing that always happens. [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7685.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7687.4s)]
*  At least that was something that was like... [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7687.9s)]
*  And I think part of that was Obama was just too inexperienced. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7690.0s)]
*  I think if he had a little more... [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7693.4s)]
*  He didn't know what he was doing with the Senate. [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7696.2s)]
*  The healthcare thing got completely fucked and universal healthcare didn't. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7698.099999999999s)]
*  I had Obamacare. [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7701.0s)]
*  It was bad. [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7702.2s)]
*  They ended up... [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7702.799999999999s)]
*  They sent me some cups. [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7704.4s)]
*  I saw some set of cups they sent me. [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7704.9s)]
*  Nice, dude. [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7706.599999999999s)]
*  You got a mug? [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7707.299999999999s)]
*  Huh? [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7708.4s)]
*  That's the... [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7708.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7709.2s)]
*  No, it's like kind of like some plastic cups. [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7709.7s)]
*  I still use them. [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7711.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7712.9s)]
*  They're cool. [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7713.799999999999s)]
*  He got worked over by thinking he could actually, you know, find common ground with the Republicans. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7715.1s)]
*  They should have just rammed the legislation down their throat. [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7723.5s)]
*  They had both houses at the time. [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7726.200000000001s)]
*  Anyway, whatever. [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7728.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7729.200000000001s)]
*  And the only person I was excited about was Bernie because I think he was actually in that run in 2016. [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7729.8s)]
*  He was like... [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7735.3s)]
*  He would have been cool. [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7736.1s)]
*  Would have been cool, but the Democrats shut that shit down. [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7737.0s)]
*  I... [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7739.200000000001s)]
*  Hey, man. [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7740.200000000001s)]
*  Well, I like Vance as a guy. [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7740.6s)]
*  He seemed like a nice guy. [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7742.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7743.900000000001s)]
*  I know that like, like he's like, you know, they say like Peter Thiel is like the guy that got him in office that sort of thing. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7744.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7749.3s)]
*  But then you start to see that all these guys have backers. [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7749.8s)]
*  Will things be different with some of these guys? [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7752.5s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7754.4s)]
*  I think but one thing that's cool is that we both like Bernie. [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7755.4s)]
*  I like Bernie too. [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7758.2s)]
*  I would have voted for Bernie. [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7759.4s)]
*  And see, that's the... [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7760.7s)]
*  Is I think those ideas unite people because he's just saying like, look, we have issues to deal with. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7761.4s)]
*  There's real issues. [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7768.9s)]
*  We're not going to pretend shit's good when it's not. [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7769.8s)]
*  And let's find real ways to do it that everybody gets and every... [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7772.2s)]
*  That's real equality. [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7775.6s)]
*  He wants to help everyone because it's not about... [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7776.9s)]
*  It's not... [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7779.6s)]
*  It's not a fucking... [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7780.2s)]
*  It's not about like, you know, cultural shit. [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7781.2s)]
*  It's about economic shit and more people are disaffected because of the, you know, people at the top. [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7783.8s)]
*  And I think that's a message that everyone can agree with. [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7790.3s)]
*  And I think when people aren't looking at things ideologically, if you just ask them about issues, people agree on a lot of fucking issues. [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7793.4s)]
*  I say that every day. [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7801.1s)]
*  They want to be able to fucking buy a house. [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7801.4s)]
*  They want to be able to afford shit and they want to be able to fucking, you know, get health care. [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7803.4s)]
*  How many people do we know? [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7807.599999999999s)]
*  Like I have, you know, I know people extended family, stuff like that, that are struggling off shit that they shouldn't... [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7809.0s)]
*  Because somebody got sick and it derails your whole fucking family. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7815.4s)]
*  We talk about that all the time. [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7818.299999999999s)]
*  It's fucked up, dude. [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7819.099999999999s)]
*  The number one cause of... [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7820.099999999999s)]
*  I mean, we say this all the time now because it's one of the few facts I know, but the number one cause of bankruptcy in America is medical debt. [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7820.799999999999s)]
*  Crazy. [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7827.4s)]
*  And so it's a fucking... [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7827.9s)]
*  The whole system is a money laundering scam. [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7829.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7831.3s)]
*  And I don't know why that hasn't changed. [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7831.8s)]
*  And if you would think at some point, one of these fucking groups would be able to change the shit, you know? [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7833.6s)]
*  I mean, there is so much money in politics and I was... [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7838.8s)]
*  Right, but it's just... [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7841.5s)]
*  It's so... [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7842.3s)]
*  People are so fed up with the fucking system. [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7843.5s)]
*  I just... [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7845.7s)]
*  You almost want there to be a war to end it all or whatever. [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7846.400000000001s)]
*  I know what you mean, man. [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7851.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7852.5s)]
*  I do know what you mean and some people do believe that. [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7853.0s)]
*  Some people think there's no way... [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7855.2s)]
*  Something has to change because this is not changing over time, right? [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7856.5s)]
*  Yeah, some people believe revolution is the only way to fucking do it. [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7859.8s)]
*  Hey, Tony tried to start one. [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7863.9s)]
*  That was the main reason, like Shane said it too on his podcast. [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7868.0s)]
*  It would have been so funny to be able to blame Tony. [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7871.7s)]
*  He'd come on one. [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7874.7s)]
*  He would just be able to like, you bombed so hard. [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7876.099999999999s)]
*  That the part of your candidate fucking lost. [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7879.3s)]
*  How fun would that be to tell Tony for the rest of his life? [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7881.9s)]
*  That's actually the thing I'm most pissed off about. [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7886.0s)]
*  Supreme Court is number two after being able to mock Tony for the rest of my life. [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7888.4s)]
*  That's what I regret the most about the election. [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7894.599999999999s)]
*  He was sweating. [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7898.9s)]
*  I sat there and watched it with him. [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7899.599999999999s)]
*  He was sweating, man. [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7902.5s)]
*  I think we could do... [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7903.9s)]
*  I know that we could do better in this country about being... [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7904.599999999999s)]
*  Making useful things. [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7907.799999999999s)]
*  I was just looking the other day in Japan. [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7909.099999999999s)]

*  You're walking by them. [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7915.2s)]
*  The fucking building is powered by... [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7916.299999999999s)]
*  People walking on it. [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7917.9s)]
*  That's fucking cool. [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7918.7s)]
*  Yeah, our infrastructure is so fucked too. [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7920.0s)]
*  It's like how... [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7921.7s)]

*  It's falling around, dude. [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7957.4s)]
*  Yeah, but it's like meanwhile, we have all these homeless people wandering around town. [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7958.5s)]
*  If you put them all in an area... [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7961.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7963.099999999999s)]
*  And set up one of these, because this floor in Japan turns footsteps into electricity. [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7963.599999999999s)]
*  Play a bit of it there. [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7967.5s)]
*  So you're thinking... [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7968.599999999999s)]
*  In Japan, even walking generates electricity. [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7969.5s)]
*  Tokyo Metro. [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7972.7s)]
*  I don't like this guy's voice. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7973.9s)]
*  The trains are powered. [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7975.5s)]
*  Yeah, I mean... [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7979.700000000001s)]
*  But if you could get 50 or 70 homeless people to power a Jamba Juice or something, you know? [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7980.3s)]
*  I agree with you, dude. [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7984.1s)]
*  How fucking great would that be? [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7984.900000000001s)]
*  They come out, they dance for 12 minutes or whatever. [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7986.200000000001s)]
*  And bam, the fucking... [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7989.6s)]
*  It's exercise for them. [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7990.6s)]
*  It's good electricity. [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7992.1s)]
*  The blender's cut on in there. [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7993.6s)]
*  And they get a free smoothie for their trouble. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7995.700000000001s)]
*  But instead, everybody's like, they need pills, you know? [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=7998.900000000001s)]
*  It's like, fucking no, dude. [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=8002.1s)]
*  That's a perfect example, though, of homelessness. [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=8003.3s)]
*  It's like, give them homes. [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=8005.3s)]
*  We have the... [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=8007.7s)]
*  We know what it takes. [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=8008.7s)]
*  Like, make fucking apartment buildings. [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=8009.8s)]
*  And like, that has been shown to work. [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=8012.2s)]
*  And most people just don't have access. [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=8014.5s)]
*  But there is all this weird, like... [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=8016.0s)]
*  You will create nonprofits to help the homeless that cost more than just getting them little apartments. [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=8018.2s)]
*  They give them recipe books. [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=8025.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=8026.2s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=8027.6s)]
*  And they'll just keep bussing them back and forth to different cities. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=8028.8s)]
*  It's basically political parties play Red Rover with them. [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=8032.4s)]
*  I know. [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=8035.9s)]
*  What they should do is, instead of bussing them, sign them up for Southwest Miles. [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=8036.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=8041.4s)]
*  And then they get some fucking miles out of it. [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=8041.9s)]
*  Give them a Southwest credit card. [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=8043.9s)]
*  Every time you ship them from Texas to New York to fucking wherever the fuck. [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=8045.4s)]
*  And then they can go on vacation. [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=8049.4s)]
*  They can earn some miles. [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=8051.9s)]
*  You're not afraid to cough about the cabin. [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=8052.9s)]
*  Someone's just hacking up a fucking dead sparrow in his throat. [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=8055.599999999999s)]
*  And I only say that because I was in San Francisco one time. [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=8059.9s)]
*  A guy threw a fucking bird at me for no reason. [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=8061.599999999999s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=8064.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=8065.099999999999s)]
*  It was a sparrow? [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=8065.599999999999s)]
*  It was small enough. [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=8066.4s)]
*  Small enough. [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=8067.7s)]
*  It could have been a warbler. [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=8068.4s)]
*  But I'm going to get him back. [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=8070.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=8071.4s)]
*  We'll see. [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=8072.4s)]
*  He put an air tag in his bindle. [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=8073.4s)]
*  And you're tracking him. [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=8075.4s)]
*  You're going to get him back. [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=8076.9s)]
*  Every time I close my eyes, I still see what he looks like. [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=8078.4s)]
*  That's horrifying. [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=8081.9s)]
*  Birds to me are unsettling creatures. [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=8083.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=8085.4s)]
*  To have one thrown at you is very tough. [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=8085.9s)]
*  The dirtiest surprise. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=8087.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=8089.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=8089.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=8090.4s)]
*  We did great, man. [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=8090.9s)]

*  Thanks so much, man. [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=8112.4s)]
*  I'm going to come back in December so I can do yours in. [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=8112.9s)]
*  Please. [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=8114.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=8115.4s)]
*  I would love that. [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=8115.9s)]
*  Remember, I didn't even know you were the guy from Comtown that I liked. [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=8116.4s)]
*  That was so fun, dude. [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=8118.4s)]
*  You're like, I met that guy once. [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=8119.4s)]
*  I was like, it was me, dude. [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KBQaT_DYzg&t=8121.4s)]
