*  I enjoy food more than just eating it. Like I just I love the whole idea of [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=414.56s)]
*  Culinary shit and food so they took me to the Beverly Hills [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=418.72s)]

*  They just brought us out a bunch of these cheeses imported from Italy [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=426.62s)]
*  Imported from Italy look at the next one. Look at the table. Look at the back room. That was the back room [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=429.78s)]
*  Oh, so there's a back room. It was I was a back room [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=433.86s)]
*  Full experience brought us out a few peronies plated cheese some sun-dried tomatoes and stuffed cherry peppers [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=436.94s)]
*  Oh like this low moisture mozzarella. They just made buffalo mozzarella straight from Italy [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=442.74s)]
*  They said it lands in LAX every Tuesday, so we kind of got the shitty one [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=447.26s)]
*  It was a Monday, but it was still great [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=450.78s)]
*  Yeah, we got you got the end of the week Buffalo mozzarella, but Buffalo mozzarella is kind of like that one thing [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=452.78s)]
*  Even when it's bad, it's good. It was fantastic. They find it from Buffalo. They said no how they find it from Italy [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=457.34s)]
*  Oh, wow, these use Buffalo milk in Italy. That's why it's like Buffalo mozzarella. Oh, and so it's oh, it's out of the Buffalo animal [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=462.34s)]
*  Yes, sir. Oh like the milk they uses from Buffalo milk. So that's like so if you're getting mozzarella from Italy [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=469.38s)]
*  Most of the time Buffalo mozzarella not what you would envision just straight fresh mozzarella is here [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=473.78s)]
*  Yeah, I thought somebody's milk and Dawson Knox up there, you know, don't be a good-looking piece of cheese [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=478.34s)]
*  So you take so they now how does that even work so I never you get hooked up with like a lot of back room [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=486.21999999999997s)]

*  What is a monger? Let's look it up that I believe it's cheese markers. That's only from watching [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=503.3s)]
*  It's always sunny in Philadelphia [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=507.94s)]
*  Charlie's dad was a cheese monger because she's monger is somebody that would die for cheese, right? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=508.94s)]
*  I think this man would die for cheese this guy Dom we were with yesterday. He would definitely die for cheese [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=513.1s)]
*  He would take one on the cheek for cheese [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=516.98s)]
*  Yeah, I'm rich and he specializes in Jesus. Okay [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=518.98s)]
*  And what's a monger just overall cuz they have a warmonger I hear of all the time. Yeah, sounds something like Mongolian maybe [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=522.4200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, what's just a monger I could say getting his con being a monger [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=530.14s)]
*  Like a broker or a dealer of something. Okay. Oh a monger. Yeah, I guess why is the cheese monger? I guess [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=534.42s)]
*  Yeah, so okay, so you get there the guy comes out [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=539.9s)]
*  Yeah [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=543.62s)]
*  so great chef Aaron may but as we met Aaron May there and then the guy came out and met Aaron and then [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=544.12s)]
*  Dom came out met Aaron and they just said let's go in the back and then they [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=548.42s)]
*  Literally brought us in the back like we weren't good fellows set up plates forks knives plates for us brought us out [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=552.3s)]
*  Peronies brought in these cheese plates and I'm a first anchovy [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=558.1s)]
*  They brought out apparently this this fantastic fantastic anchovy straight from Italy as well [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=561.7s)]
*  Was it alive when they brought it out or not? It was not was in a can was like a little tiny aluminum can but I [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=566.2s)]
*  Equated it so my first time golf my first time on a golf course was Pebble Beach and I told them I told them yesterday [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=569.86s)]
*  That's what this was like because I'm having anchovy and poured from Italy first anchovy instead of an [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=575.0600000000001s)]
*  Honest shit pizza. So the anchovy was damn good put a little anchovy on bread a little buffalo mozzarella [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=581.02s)]
*  Dried tomato on it and then they had imported olive oil from Italy. It was it was it was an [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=585.8000000000001s)]
*  Immaculate time that's some more [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=592.08s)]
*  It was a macula dude. Hey, if you're ever in a land you want to go we'll go. Yeah, man [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=595.08s)]
*  I can't I don't get offered things like that. It must be because obviously I guess people assume that you have you [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=599.44s)]
*  Enjoy food. I very much do and not enough not in a stereotypical fat guy way, right? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=609.12s)]
*  Like I don't this may shock you. I don't eat like I don't eat too much fast food, right? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=614.1s)]
*  It's not like I'm going home and pounding Burger King every day. Just yeah, I appreciate good food [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=618.36s)]
*  Yeah, good food is is the best it is good, man [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=623.34s)]
*  I think I did I I grew up on just really not good food, right? Yeah [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=627.44s)]
*  I think there was no appreciation for food exactly. I've done the same way like I never grew up like going [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=631.36s)]
*  Insanely nice steak houses and whatnot, but even I mean there's also bad food. That's fantastic as well [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=636.66s)]
*  I was talking to a co-worker in my last week Kate. She was saying she grew up always eating the [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=641.5799999999999s)]
*  Very very thin pork chops that once you cook them that like you can see like the white bubbles [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=646.06s)]
*  Oh, yeah pop up on them. Those are pretty damn good. Oh, I don't mind [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=650.74s)]
*  It is interesting how they have that fat bubble that bubbles if fats bubble and I'm taking it [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=654.54s)]
*  It's it's the cheap pork chops, but they do the job [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=659.14s)]
*  Yeah, I'm trying to think of something else that we oh, you know, what was big when I was young [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=662.8199999999999s)]
*  Ah fish sticks really you ever do fish stick I never did I never did maybe I don't know that was maybe Louisiana thing [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=667.38s)]
*  There was more fish sticks by you, but I'm also I also grew up by the water too, but I never dabbled in a fish stick [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=674.62s)]
*  What is it? I guess theoretically just a what about a warm clam or something come across the table. Yeah. Yeah, yeah never never home [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=679.6999999999999s)]
*  I don't know if I can one time I tried to make clams in my house [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=686.18s)]
*  It was a mess of failure [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=688.76s)]
*  Yeah [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=690.2199999999999s)]
*  You have to because you're you're gonna have to wait to make sure if they're alive or not if they don't um if they don't [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=690.66s)]
*  Open immediately. They're still alive. So if you have to pry it open, it's dead and you can't eat it [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=696.54s)]
*  So that was that was troubling to me and then I tried to cook about the barbecue [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=700.38s)]
*  It didn't work out and how do you know if they're alive is you do like you just like whisper in there? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=702.9399999999999s)]
*  Like how do you even know? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=706.74s)]
*  I believe what the process was was you put them in under hot water [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=707.54s)]
*  You boil you boil them and then one the ones that crack open are dead and then that's the ones you eat [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=710.86s)]
*  That was I was our big clam kick like during kovat during kovat. I tried to expand my culinary life [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=716.5799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and it was during kovats [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=721.9s)]
*  Probably three years ago now, but the ones that don't open [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=723.46s)]
*  They had big dead. They're dead dead and you can't pry them open even because that would be in dead thing [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=726.82s)]
*  Oh, yeah, and you don't want I think there's something like even when in the clam culture. You don't [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=731.96s)]
*  You don't like after something's buried you don't go get you know, no, you don't get in the coffin with it. Absolutely not [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=736.7800000000001s)]
*  And then we can't cook it. We got to eat raw clams [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=742.7s)]
*  I wonder if I were to make a baked clam though if I could have a dead baked clam. I [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=744.46s)]
*  Don't that's a good question see that's the problem because then you they're all closed right so you don't know the difference [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=749.42s)]
*  Well, the baked clam is usually they'll like take the clam. They'll shuck the clams say the clam out [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=754.62s)]
*  Oh, yeah, and then put it in the half shell put on the half shell and then but like bake it so it gets cooked [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=758.4599999999999s)]
*  I mean everything is dead before it gets cooked. Yeah, but raw clam obviously can't even dead one [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=762.2199999999999s)]
*  I guess it was interesting that clams and oysters are living things [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=766.26s)]
*  Oh, well, someone told me one time that clams are like oysters that got molested when they were kids and never grew up [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=769.66s)]
*  Yeah, I could kind of see it I mean I when I do envision clams and oysters [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=776.0400000000001s)]
*  I think of oysters as maybe say the grandfather of shellfish. Yeah, they're definitely the elders. They're the senior citizens [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=779.9200000000001s)]
*  Oh, they definitely they have like a newspaper under their oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, maybe maybe a walker. Yeah [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=785.5600000000001s)]
*  Trying to just wrangle in a clam to talk tell about the old days. Yeah [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=791.6800000000001s)]
*  And then listen to muscles too. I love a good muscle, but those are the big three [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=795.84s)]
*  It's hard to denote sometimes the difference for me between clams and muscles [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=799.2800000000001s)]
*  Let's look at what is the what is the purpose of oysters in the ocean Zach? [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=802.62s)]
*  Let's look it up because we've had recently we've actually been talking about this on here [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=806.54s)]
*  That oysters are like a um, I would bet they're pretty vital honestly [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=812.0600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, oysters are a crucial component of global ocean health these animals [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=815.9s)]
*  Oh, they're animals filter and clean the surrounding water and provide habitat food and jobs Wow [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=820.18s)]
*  so they're kind of like a [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=826.98s)]
*  Like a [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=829.58s)]
*  Temp service or something maybe I guess and their reefs could also serve as barriers to storms and tides. Mmm, that's pretty sick [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=830.62s)]
*  Wow, so they they got a lot of responsibility [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=837.26s)]
*  How do they filter can you look up how oysters filter in the ocean? [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=840.66s)]
*  Because if they're filters and this is the crazy part [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=845.78s)]
*  That if they're filters [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=849.1s)]
*  Oysters comes and other shellfish help remove excess nitrogen from waters by incorporating into their shells and [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=851.26s)]
*  Tissues as they grow that would make sense if I've never seen a clean oyster shell [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=857.1s)]
*  Mmm, that's a good they're all pretty damn dirty. They're all got a little bit of dirt in there sacrifice themselves for the ocean [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=861.46s)]
*  Which is interesting. You know, which is a new every day, but that's crazy [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=867.78s)]
*  Then so say you broke into like a trap house right somewhere sir, and there's some dude in there. He's dirtied up, right? [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=870.46s)]
*  He's got soil even a little bit of soil around his mouth, right and you just put it right [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=876.3s)]
*  You put horse radish [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=882.34s)]
*  Dumped horse radish well because that's like a oyster. Yeah, dude, you're a horse rash would take him out pretty quickly [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=884.9s)]
*  So he's right is so kind of like would be his kryptonite that he has kryptonite [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=890.82s)]
*  But then you eat him like that's what you're doing your break [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=894.38s)]
*  You're basically because the oysters like something like it's like a like a car filter. Maybe your grandfather's car filter [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=896.86s)]

*  Sandwich for lunch every day. There's no need for it not every day [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=1982.22s)]

*  Yeah, I know I know quite literally everybody on this plane is looking at me saying, please don't sit here [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2018.22s)]
*  Oh, that's why it's nice though because now I'm a Delta Diamond guy. No big deal. I got to order I got to um [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2023.42s)]
*  Board the flight first. Yes, so at least I get that out of the way [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2029.78s)]
*  but I mean there was one time me Kate me Caleb and our and our girl Kelsey were traveling to [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2033.02s)]
*  Lake Tahoe from LA's was a quick flight, but our flight got canceled night before so we had to get on a southwest flight [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2038.08s)]
*  Last minute and we got like the 54th opening on Southwest how there's his first come first serve [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2043.24s)]
*  so we were few the last people to sit down and [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2049.12s)]
*  I was walking on the island literally I felt like far as come getting on the bus knowing nobody wants you to sit there [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2052.08s)]
*  There were only middle seats left then thank God road say 23. I saw like a 12 year old kid by the window [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2057.16s)]
*  I said you're my motherfucker just sat right next to we took out [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2062.14s)]
*  We became friends name was Terry. He was a great kid. He was like 13. We bonded the whole flight [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2066.0s)]
*  He was saying he was going to visit his grandparents in Reno and we we had a great time [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2070.7200000000003s)]
*  We played baseball on his iPad together [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2074.62s)]
*  He was great [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2076.4s)]
*  But he say he saved my day because I was quite literally shitty bricks knowing every single person on this plane is [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2077.2s)]
*  Telling themselves, please don't sit here. Please don't sit here. Please don't sit here. It's a shitty feeling [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2082.76s)]
*  That'll make you want to lose a little weight [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2087.2400000000002s)]
*  It's like that Plinko game kind of real like but you don't want it to get in that you don't want it [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2088.4s)]
*  The Southwest was quite literally like it was a scary experience because there were only middle seats left [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2093.6s)]
*  There were only middle seats left and then there was maybe maybe the idea that there was an aisle seat all the way in the back [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2098.48s)]
*  But should I risk that instead of sitting next to the 12 year old? I went with the 12 year old [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2104.28s)]
*  Yeah, you got to make that I was a 12 year old and isn't amazing that at that point you go to the warmth of children [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2108.6800000000003s)]
*  You go to the kindness of a young child who has yet to determine in his head [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2114.1200000000003s)]
*  Hey, I don't like I don't want to sit next to this fat guy to the fix [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2118.8s)]
*  Yes, it was well, it was it was not that Terry was a great kid, but it was also just he's smaller [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2122.54s)]
*  He's a small guy. Okay, so he's a very small kid. So you small you guys put matching up together [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2127.46s)]
*  Yeah, there's it almost made sense. It's a beautiful relief whenever someone ever big skates that's next to you [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2132.5s)]
*  It was like a mice and meat. Yes, that's perfect example. I mean Terry we bonded we had a great time Wow [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2137.46s)]
*  Yeah, it was really nice [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2142.5s)]
*  But there it's always great like sometimes when you sit next to a toddler you get lucky for a toddler [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2143.48s)]
*  Sit next to you on a plane. That's always convenient at work. We have we have a [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2147.14s)]
*  Shorter gentleman. I like to sit next to him if we travel together. I've seen him you guys did the yeah [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2151.68s)]
*  Yeah, we did our first Morgan mall and Sunday Conversation. He took my place [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2156.44s)]
*  Oh, you might have seen him in that yeah, but the brother and he snuck in the brother on walling [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2160.94s)]
*  Yeah, well what happened was well what happened was we we originally when we first started Sunday Conversation [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2165.12s)]
*  We were doing to Rome, you know who ronas [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2169.72s)]
*  Rome was also doing them as well [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2172.12s)]
*  So I went I was I was pissed because at the time I'm still a massive fan [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2173.52s)]
*  But I always loved arius rucker and that was the day they were doing like a four-place scramble like with wall and Hardy [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2177.52s)]
*  Darius and Jake Owen and then we had me and ron had a shoot with Doug Flutie in Melbourne, Florida [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2183.32s)]
*  hmm, and they said you're gonna you're going to Doug Flutie's Oz going a [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2189.68s)]

*  Fucking Zaz about to hang out all day with Darius man [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2197.4s)]
*  And I'm sitting here with Doug Flutie in the conference room in a Marriott in Melbourne Beach, Florida [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2199.8s)]
*  That's I was disappointed about that. Luckily two years later [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2203.6s)]
*  We did Darius on Sunday Conversation and that was great. But right at the time it stung right stung [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2206.88s)]
*  We have when the boss says the boss says yeah [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2211.92s)]
*  So you're growing up there only child right and what kind of work are you in when you're doing? [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2215.08s)]

*  You got you got to start you and you started thickening up. Yeah, we picked up we picked up pretty good [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2226.6400000000003s)]
*  Did the whole family because sometimes there's kind of like a thing where a whole family will put on weight at the same time [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2231.84s)]
*  like something happens a grandmother dies or there's a [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2236.88s)]
*  like a not a power outage but like a [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2240.56s)]

*  I would say half half thix half non thix [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2249.7400000000002s)]
*  Okay, but in like the not the immediate family like man's and uncle's and whatnot, but I've grown up [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2252.42s)]
*  Yeah, I would just say I would say fun guy [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2257.1s)]
*  I don't think I don't think absurdly funny but fun always hung out with the with the with the good guys [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2259.04s)]
*  I'm still best friends with all my friends growing up. So yeah, I think relatively normal childhood Catholic high school [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2264.0s)]
*  I'm Catholic high school and grade school. That was interesting. Oh, wow, cuz that's all boys in there, huh? [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2270.02s)]

*  They must have been so jealous. You guys. Yeah, dude [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2280.44s)]
*  The thing with two of them is there was so there were three high schools in the area Catholic high schools [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2283.12s)]
*  Sacred Heart was all girls. Sean and I was all boys and then Kellenberg where I went was co-ed [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2287.28s)]
*  So they all had Sacred Heart I think had Catillion and shaman on had aqua prom [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2291.74s)]
*  So then we always had to watch our our few secret heart or shaman out of friends trying to match up [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2296.62s)]
*  Yeah, so they all had to get each other from a distance and we actually had no problem at Kellenberg [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2300.74s)]
*  Yeah, our prom got canceled for a flaunting of affluence and what people being wealthy [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2304.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, definitely not me but like other people like got canceled in 2006 our prom did so I never had a problem [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2310.14s)]
*  Yeah, that was that was a whole big thing Colbert talked about it on Colbert report. Do you prom got canceled? [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2315.7s)]
*  What happened your problem got canceled? Yeah, well, I don't do a fake prom somewhere [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2320.4s)]

*  Which pretty fun it was fun [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2328.84s)]
*  But hey, let me tell you as a larger gentleman that did not have sex in high school [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2331.06s)]

*  It was like sitting next to a toddler on a plane. Seriously. It was quite nice that that I will say was fun [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2340.04s)]

*  Dude what if you don't think about that? [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2347.8s)]
*  You don't think about the other half of the school because there's half of the school that's like yeah prom. This is it [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2350.4s)]
*  I have a girlfriend. I have a boyfriend. I'm lucky. Um, you know unisex. I don't need anybody [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2355.52s)]

*  I I was a little concerned though people were gonna start taking dates to this boat ride [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2384.16s)]
*  Luckily they didn't right and it was fine. We basically just hung out. It was dude [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2387.34s)]
*  Do you remember how nerve-racking it was if somebody I can have you to make to get a date, right? [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2391.24s)]
*  like we had like Sadie Hawking right where the kid had a [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2397.32s)]

*  They definitely find something I was watching an animal show one time and they like went to the end of the earth to find their [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2439.44s)]
*  Thing to present their lady. I think you're watching maybe ice age or something. I think it's something like that using a pearl to propose [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2443.7200000000003s)]
*  I think so because I I'm not seeing anything maybe not a pearl but definitely something they like they have to find something and then [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2450.4s)]
*  Give it to the lady. I'm pretty sure how do penguins propose to one another? [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2455.84s)]
*  Pebbles sorry, mmm [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2462.8s)]
*  Unless fancy pearl it's a very good point. That's all a pebble is dude. Yeah a pebble is just a pearl [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2465.4s)]
*  It's fine. This is smoothest pebble [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2471.1600000000003s)]
*  Is it that nice romance people think romance is that huh? That's a good point [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2473.88s)]
*  Is it during courtship a male penguin will find the smoothest pebble to give to a female as a gift if she likes the offering? [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2477.6800000000003s)]
*  She'll place it in the nest and the two will continue building up their little pebble mound in preparation for the eggs [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2484.88s)]
*  That's actually beautiful. I didn't know that that yeah, I'm gonna cry right now [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2490.52s)]
*  I don't know that that was their beginning of the foundation for their nest for their eggs. That's fucking cute [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2493.6000000000004s)]

*  It's first of all to even be a penguin right and balance a little pebble [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2501.28s)]
*  Yeah, and they don't it's like they look down at the pebbles there. They got to go find the smoothest pebble [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2506.4s)]
*  Yeah, and first of all, how do you even lift the pebble further? [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2510.08s)]
*  Because you can barely even look down I don't think a penguin can [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2512.84s)]
*  So you have to almost get the pebble way up here. Look at it. Maybe kick it. Yes, but then how do you test if it's the smoothest? [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2516.2400000000002s)]
*  How about that [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=2524.1600000000003s)]

*  You know, you got to have an agent subservient to god [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=3570.72s)]
*  For example, the god [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=3573.2s)]
*  Typically regarded as a metaphor for the yet yetzir hara or evil inclination. So the evil inclination of god [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=3576.24s)]
*  What does that say zack [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=3585.04s)]

*  And then went bad, but it's first appeared in a hebrew bible. So that kind of means he was like the judge judy kind of of [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=3592.96s)]
*  Right and then again he went wrong. He wanted all the power for himself, I guess [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=3598.7999999999997s)]

*  Older sibling or a father teaches the child how to masturbate really [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=5323.06s)]
*  Because then you're learning it you're learning sex from like it's part of a familial thing [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=5327.3s)]

*  I know what they're doing [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=5704.42s)]
*  I [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=5706.58s)]
*  But my problem is I start to then think of sex only in like the frames and the things you see on pornography, right? [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=5708.0199999999995s)]

*  You just go through these vignettes [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=5723.94s)]
*  That our own pornography doesn't even feel like a lot about like physical touch anymore 100% [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=5726.179999999999s)]
*  And a lot of guests have said that that porn makes people delusional about how sex actually is [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=5730.5s)]
*  Not every time we're having sex as a girl going to be streaming at the top of her lungs [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=5735.62s)]

*  Or saying anything talking like this. Oh, yeah. Oh, I'm the dude during sex. I am the silent [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=5744.82s)]

*  I think I a lot of times feel like i'm about to get caught [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=5780.9s)]
*  So and I think that comes from having had sex outdoors I think that comes from [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=5785.78s)]
*  You know, I gotta be you know, I got bj'd behind a um [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=5789.86s)]

*  Yeah, if I said maybe did it that night of the podcast, which I never have but I think I think that would be that would be [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=5928.26s)]
*  towing a line [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=5933.86s)]

*  Porn to prepare for your guests then like that has to be [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=5955.700000000001s)]
*  Sometimes because so a lot of most of my guests there's like porn girls and only fans girls [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=5959.04s)]
*  The only most of them are only fans girls. So not all of them do porn [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=5964.42s)]
*  That's a good point and that's not all the report. Sorry [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=5967.54s)]
*  There's a lot that there's a lot that are just some some don't even post like their boobs [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=5969.860000000001s)]
*  Some literally don't even post boobs and make [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=5974.1s)]
*  Astronomical amount of money so my guests vary from porn full-blown porn stars like angela white two girls that literally don't even post [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=5976.26s)]

*  I'll definitely i'll definitely tune in I got subscribed for science for research today of but how do you use york and all then? [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=5999.14s)]

*  That's true. But then again, it's also it depends on what they're posting on their only fans [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6015.0599999999995s)]
*  Not everybody's posting the the the peak the peak of what you want to see what's your only fans bill every month? [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6018.98s)]
*  um [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6026.179999999999s)]
*  I think I subscribed to like 28 accounts, but honestly a lot of them are free [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6027.7s)]
*  So a lot of girls do free accounts and then they'll charge in the dms for a whole bunch of money for the nudity or whatnot [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6030.820000000001s)]
*  So I don't I don't like I buy everything in the dms. I would say the bill a month maybe 100 200 bucks [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6036.820000000001s)]
*  It really not many girls do too many. Um [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6041.46s)]
*  High prices a lot are free [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6045.9400000000005s)]
*  And and I really I don't buy much content from my guests. I literally just look at it [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6048.5s)]
*  Sounds stupid but journalists i'll just look at like when you subscribe to them the dm that comes up [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6053.3s)]
*  What they're offering how much they're offering stuff for i've also found like a great way to prepare for the guests is to go [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6058.34s)]
*  Through their twitters like they're just there we sweet fun stuff tick tock stuff [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6063.54s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of dating questions like talk about dating but um, no actually the porn itself. I don't watch too much of the porn [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6066.98s)]
*  Hmm. I also I also do that work. I can't watch too much porn at work [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6073.54s)]
*  But then again, it's work [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6077.78s)]
*  But it does there's something that if you're watching porn at work, there's something that feels like you are [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6079.38s)]
*  Not doing well, would you agree with that? [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6084.82s)]

*  But if you have your wits about you and you haven't drank in a day or two and you're thinking to yourself [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6178.74s)]

*  How do they create an only fans that could be marketable? [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6340.18s)]
*  Well, that's what a lot of people say. I mean they're the only thing the one of the beautiful things about only fans is so many girls [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6343.78s)]
*  There's a market for everything. I've learned. Yeah, literally a market for everything [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6349.3s)]
*  So if you're not feeling maybe like a maybe like bo derrick [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6352.5s)]
*  There's still probably guys that are in the market for what for what you're selling [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6356.02s)]
*  Yeah, and that's just completely a fact [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6359.3s)]
*  I mean one of my favorite questions to ask every guest i'll ask every guest this is what is your most interesting odd [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6361.62s)]
*  Subscriber request you've come across from your subscribers and they all say the most [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6367.3s)]
*  Ridiculous things there's there's people out there that will like you for you. No matter what there's there's there's a category for everybody [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6371.68s)]
*  I think and that that's I've learned that yes [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6377.46s)]
*  Do you think it's healthy for women to do only fans? [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6380.34s)]
*  Do you have do you ever do you gain any thought on it by getting to meet a lot of these ladies and uh, [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6382.660000000001s)]
*  Have you what do you think about that? I think it's it's an interesting [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6387.299999999999s)]
*  It's interesting and it depends on the way they think about themselves kind of [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6390.5s)]
*  Like if there's a there's a lot of girls that will complain to me [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6394.58s)]
*  But they can't find a boyfriend because they're doing only fans or something [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6397.62s)]
*  And i'll tell them all the time like I say this all the time. There was a point in in my career at borstal where [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6400.82s)]
*  So many comments about me were like very very mean and like I would I just thought to myself [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6406.419999999999s)]
*  I'm not gonna like i'm just gonna stop reading them because I don't want I don't mean this to sound the wrong way [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6410.9s)]
*  but I think like [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6416.419999999999s)]
*  Probably if there's like some guy and these are also people that are commenting super mean shit about me on twitter [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6418.179999999999s)]
*  So that guy probably is more mad at himself [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6422.98s)]
*  I guess he doesn't like himself and he's just deflecting that onto me to be mean to me [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6424.74s)]
*  So I i'm telling the girls that i'm I always tell them even off camera [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6428.58s)]
*  I'm telling them if someone is being mean to you calling you let's say a whore about for being only fans [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6432.099999999999s)]
*  They're probably just jealous that they can't do what you do that [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6437.46s)]
*  They don't have that opportunity to do what you do because let me tell you the the money they make and what they do [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6439.62s)]
*  It's it's unbelievable only fans is like it's a crazy platform [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6444.66s)]
*  And if you and anyone that would make fun of them for doing that I just think is it's crazy. They're [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6447.7s)]
*  They're they're geniuses. I often say they're geniuses and they're lovely geniuses [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6453.7s)]
*  Well, I mean it's like yeah people will call you a whore. They will call you a fat. They will call you a [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6457.46s)]
*  piss baby or whatever [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6464.42s)]
*  But a lot of that is on them. It's on them. I've never I've often said this i've never [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6467.0599999999995s)]
*  Wanted to talk shit about somebody that [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6473.86s)]

*  I found it after dark one night in high school [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6562.1s)]
*  And just these four gigolo's hanging out in vegas and fucking chicks doing their job [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6564.26s)]

*  That's almost worse than a dick tattoo and a dick tattoo and over a fat you gotta stay hard for [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6606.66s)]
*  Or they'll have them write like this is a butt and like point at it [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6609.94s)]

*  Frank Sinatra. He just had that vibe about him. He was just the coolest guy and just amazing [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6651.38s)]

*  And before I forgot what caleb asked her but she was basically saying in her acting career [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6742.74s)]
*  She's never wanted to fake things. Hmm, and then i'm telling myself [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6746.66s)]
*  Does it mean drew brymore's about to kiss me right now? [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6750.82s)]
*  The way she was talking she kept saying she never fakes things in acting [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6754.26s)]
*  And we started reading it and as you see there [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6758.5s)]
*  she got up out of her chair then came up and sat still like right in front of me and then [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6760.74s)]
*  Said in the line, then she went in for a kiss and then we kissed and I just said to myself was though [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6765.06s)]

*  And then we fucking caleb told her well not that not that we just did this for fun [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6776.820000000001s)]
*  We had to we had as you see in the clip too [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6780.26s)]
*  We had to like get a shot of us both going in directly so we had to get the cameras closer [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6782.26s)]
*  So we did we had to shoot it again and she did it again. Oh my I kissed her twice [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6786.1s)]
*  Now the second time you have to feel like you're in like a little relationship [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6790.1s)]
*  I did I said to myself am I about to go to dinner with you brymore? [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6793.3s)]

*  I think she posted that clip and she tagged me before caleb no big deal, but she seems really cool [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6807.14s)]
*  she seemed like she's gotten into the uh [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6811.46s)]
*  Like the podcast social media space like she gets it, you know [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6815.3s)]
*  Yeah, I think there's some people that are like getting real like really late to the train of like being okay with doing social media [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6818.900000000001s)]
*  She was so nice and I will say which is kind of shocking now [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6824.26s)]
*  We've never really had a mean guest per se I think as the guests get bigger and bigger [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6826.740000000001s)]
*  I'm noticing there's a reason why they get why they're so big and I think it's because they're just like good people [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6831.06s)]
*  Everyone is just so nice. There's really no one that's mean not that it won't be me, but like they're all just [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6836.9s)]
*  Exceedingly nice like overbearingly nice. She was amazing like drake was so nice to us rogers was so nice to us [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6843.04s)]

*  So there's a there's a difference between a lot of them will be well that caleb said on when he was on here like well [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6855.3s)]
*  They'll book it our booking people will book it and then they'll just be in and out like ice cube [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6861.14s)]

*  A few guests are mean to me, which is fine. I don't really care [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6907.62s)]
*  I think larry david would both be mean to me and caleb and he would just kind of take it over which I think [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6910.1s)]
*  Would be hilarious. Yeah, and I think kind of my other I know he's going to have to go through stuff right now [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6913.54s)]
*  But I think jamie fox would be really funny [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6917.86s)]
*  I think jerry fox would be a great one. So I guess those are my current white whales [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6919.94s)]
*  Yeah, I think uh, who else I would love to have on here is um, uh quaid randy quaid [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6923.86s)]

*  Um randy quaid, where'd you get that from? He's just like he's just so I just [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6937.22s)]
*  I don't know. I just wonder about his journey what he's been up to. He's such like this iconic actor [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6942.9s)]
*  um and played such an iconic character in uh [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6947.62s)]
*  National lampoon, I don't know. I think I would just be intrigued. Would he be your acting world? Um white whale [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6951.38s)]
*  No, i'd probably go julia roberts first [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6958.34s)]
*  Respect who doesn't love julia roberts god, dude if I oh if she only knew what I would love to if I just [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6961.78s)]

*  For some reason I could see her enjoying a sweet tea [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6972.82s)]
*  I don't think she'd let me sit that close to her, but that would be fine [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6974.74s)]
*  I picture a porch. I picture a large porch rocking chairs back and forth like maybe the distance where I right now [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6977.9400000000005s)]

*  I think in the actual show i'm drew brahma would have been my pick. I I do do believe that [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6985.86s)]
*  I mean obviously like sandler would be cool. Oh, yeah sandler chanting tatum. I think would be good [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6990.02s)]
*  Tatum who else? Uh, but yeah my top right now is like larry david jimmy fox sandler. Yeah, that'd be my top three [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=6995.86s)]

*  Way to tell it properly. I would imagine you can't really tell it properly though in school [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=7491.22s)]
*  I hope that's also not not a project you're reading that loud [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=7494.5s)]
*  That sounds like a teacher only [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=7497.700000000001s)]
*  But if the teacher only is reading it to me that has hella perv vibes, dude [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=7499.7s)]

*  uh [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=7537.06s)]
*  My high school there was like um [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=7537.7s)]
*  We had tests at the end of every trimester that was worth about 30 of our grade and then the [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=7539.7s)]
*  Average of those three trimesters was half of it [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=7545.38s)]
*  Then the other half was comps and the end of your test would be 50 of our grade [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=7548.18s)]
*  The end of your test would be 50 of our grade [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=7552.1s)]
*  So my buddy literally at the end of senior year or junior year whenever you're applying to colleges [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=7554.5s)]

*  Wrote a paragraph to the teacher at the end on the last um thing saying I really don't want to go to community college [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=7582.1s)]

*  I think in this instance, man, I I feel like this is something you do in college [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=7595.7s)]
*  I feel like it's a little risque to do it in high school [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=7599.78s)]
*  um [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=7603.14s)]

*  This had to be last period dude, you have a mouth full of fucking sweet tarts [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=7634.26s)]
*  You just rocked up and then everyone's probably walking around the hallway saying who had the best sex story of the day [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=7638.1s)]
*  And everyone's exchanging sex stories. So this seems to be a ninth period type of thing. Wow, it's interesting [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=7642.34s)]
*  But then also it's like who could become a graphic novelist, you know, and this is where they start [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=7647.54s)]
*  And this is really learn that they have that ability. Um, what else we got zach? Well, you mentioned the weekend [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=7652.1s)]
*  This is a big deal. A I generated a fake song of uh drake in the weekend, which is uh, [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=7657.62s)]
*  I guess a lot of people in the industry are very concerned by this obviously because I I can't play the song [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=7663.46s)]
*  But if you hear it, it's pretty [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=7668.5s)]
*  It sounds like it's an actual track from these guys really so someone has said ai create a fake weekend drake collab [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=7670.5s)]

*  I don't know if he showed you this either but for drake caleb made [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=7690.26s)]
*  Used ai to make a drake sunday conversation song and then we played it for him [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=7693.54s)]
*  And he like enjoyed it like it sounded like drake and it was a full song that caleb wrote [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=7698.66s)]

*  those art books from like the 1500s or something. Oh, yeah with the [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=8419.779999999999s)]

*  I don't judge. Yeah, I mean that earlier when you mentioning that you would go five miles to get it to get a your eyes in some porn [[02:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=8578.42s)]

*  They're obviously gonna say their food's good. Right? What if the food's not actually good and then yeah, it's awkward [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=8685.619999999999s)]
*  What um [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=8691.14s)]
*  What uh [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=8693.300000000001s)]
*  Do you think you'll ever end up maybe doing a food show or something like that? It would kind of fit [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=8694.42s)]
*  Huh, maybe I would love to that's like that's that I guess that would kind of be the goal [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=8697.300000000001s)]
*  I just like I like food tv. I really enjoy it [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=8700.42s)]
*  I uh, I mean I used to do a burger show at work for quite a while [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=8703.06s)]
*  There was a good period of like maybe three years where I was just not doing that great at work [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=8705.54s)]
*  And I was always doing a burger show and I enjoyed it, but I probably did I don't think I was [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=8708.98s)]
*  that good at [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=8713.54s)]
*  Describing the burgers. I would like to see now that i'm so much more comfortable in front of a camera [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=8715.6s)]
*  How I would redo it and just make it more back. I would just put it down [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=8719.539999999999s)]
*  I basically do like a Dave pizzeria view [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=8722.42s)]
*  But with burgers and definitely was just wildly less successful obviously [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=8724.98s)]
*  But if ever did a food show, I would like to do way more like high more higher produced [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=8728.5s)]
*  Maybe trying more different cuisines that I haven't tried. Yeah a lot of intriguing that like indian food [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=8733.22s)]
*  I would like to dive into [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=8738.82s)]
*  Mmm, maybe some thai. Oh, yeah. I'm really enjoying mediterranean food [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=8739.939999999999s)]
*  Yeah, stuff like that just expanding the old palate [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=8745.539999999999s)]
*  So I'd be I would definitely do a food show at the time for the time that we're doing ice cream and only fans [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=8748.42s)]
*  But maybe down the road. I would I do love food. Yeah, you got a palette for it man, and that's nice [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=8752.66s)]
*  Because some people their tongue they really it's a [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=8757.14s)]
*  It's got more uh intel in it. Yeah when I got when I had covid I couldn't taste anything that kind of stung [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=8760.18s)]
*  Yeah, that was horrible [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=8765.859999999999s)]
*  Did you um [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=8767.859999999999s)]
*  We might have talked about everything, uh, we've been here a while three hours [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=8770.42s)]
*  Yeah [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=8774.34s)]
*  um [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=8775.54s)]
*  Did you ever been to a live taping of an only fans or pornography shoot dude? I have not [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=8779.78s)]
*  There's i'm is that something you would do or not? [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=8785.140000000001s)]
*  I think I don't really see the allure [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=8788.02s)]
*  There are some girls I know in la right now [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=8790.5s)]
*  They're actually trying to get me to go to one tomorrow, but I gotta leave I gotta leave tomorrow [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=8791.86s)]
*  So i'm not gonna go but then he told me to come with so much fun [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=8795.220000000001s)]
*  I don't really see the the allure of it like if i'm not doing the fucking I don't [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=8797.62s)]
*  Why do I want to see somebody else do it? Yeah, so I don't really see the allure there [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=8801.619999999999s)]
*  And i'm assuming it's awkward. I mean i've for every porn person i've talked to [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=8806.179999999998s)]
*  They make it seem like it's a pretty professional setting doesn't sound fun to go to [[02:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=8810.179999999998s)]
*  There's no wanting in my brain to want to go to a porn set. I would I don't want to I like to see how the cookie [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=8815.38s)]
*  Gets crumbled in a kitchen [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=8819.38s)]
*  Maybe not on the porn set. I'll enjoy the porn. I don't need to see how it's made. Yeah [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=8821.46s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I feel you man. Um, I don't think the actors want us there either [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=8825.14s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's probably yeah, I don't know if you're sitting over there [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=8830.179999999998s)]
*  I don't want to be like say you're chewing gum or something and they look over and they're like, you know [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=8833.46s)]
*  Then what yeah, they're getting you're talking in their shot talking in their backswing. Yeah, or just like yeah, you blow a cum shot [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=8839.779999999999s)]
*  Oh, never want to blow a cum shot and you gotta restart [[02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=8846.58s)]
*  Oh, are you cheer when somebody ejaculates that would see that would be kind of cool. Actually. Yeah, there's a live audience [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=8850.5s)]
*  Like that's the thing though if you want to go bills when somebody yeah, someone jumps over a table [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=8856.58s)]
*  You guys want to see I mean I bet they [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=8861.62s)]
*  Not that I bet I would guarantee if porn companies did live audiences for porns [[02:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=8863.94s)]
*  They would pack it out [[02:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=8868.1s)]
*  That's a great point. Huh? That could be what's next. Yeah [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqLAvJ2kpC4&t=8869.94s)]
