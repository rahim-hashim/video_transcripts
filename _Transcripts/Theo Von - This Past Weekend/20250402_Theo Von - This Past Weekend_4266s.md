*  You gotta keep it timed up right [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=179.76s)]
*  to where you're not sticking around in one place too long [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=181.88s)]

*  he was fasting whenever we were doing that. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=222.44s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=225.48s)]
*  He'd been on a 40 day fast. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=226.32s)]
*  Yeah, he's done that for as long as I can remember. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=228.08s)]
*  I remember him, when I was growing up, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=230.88000000000002s)]
*  he would just go and stay out in the wild, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=232.56s)]
*  in a tent or something, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=237.04000000000002s)]
*  and just drink apple juice or something. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=238.0s)]
*  I'm like, dude, how is this possible? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=239.92000000000002s)]
*  That doesn't sound like that. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=243.88000000000002s)]
*  That sounds like hiding from your wife. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=244.72000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, he needed some space, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=246.44s)]
*  didn't have enough money to get a trailer or something. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=248.8s)]
*  Cause it was crazy, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=253.92000000000002s)]
*  cause I'd just been looking into fasting, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=254.76000000000002s)]
*  cause people say if you fast, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=256.0s)]
*  it'll help eat away the cancer cells that are in your body. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=257.76s)]
*  So when he was like, I've been on 40 days. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=260.94s)]
*  Well, they say that only takes a couple days to do that, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=262.96000000000004s)]
*  what you're talking about, right? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=265.56s)]
*  Like if you fast for a couple days, it'll do that. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=266.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=268.6s)]
*  I think. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=269.44s)]
*  Yeah, no, that's what I hear. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=270.26s)]
*  Once you get past 48 hours. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=271.1s)]
*  Yeah, I think what he was doing it for was spiritual purposes. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=272.24s)]
*  That's what he used to do it for, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=277.68s)]
*  and that's probably what he's doing it for now. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=278.92s)]
*  Yeah, a team of researchers from MSK has shown [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=281.0s)]
*  for the first time that fasting can reprogram [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=283.48s)]
*  the metabolism of natural killer cells, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=285.28000000000003s)]
*  helping them to survive in the harsh environment [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=287.12s)]
*  in and around tumors while improving [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=289.08s)]
*  their cancer fighting ability. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=290.64s)]
*  But it just blew my mind. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=292.12s)]
*  I was like, God, this dude's on 40 days. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=293.40000000000003s)]
*  Put this dude back in the Bible. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=295.6s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, dude, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=297.12s)]
*  I don't understand how that's physically possible. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=298.96000000000004s)]
*  I pretty much have been for the last little while fast [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=301.92s)]
*  until noon. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=304.72s)]
*  I'll do my workout and everything [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=306.88s)]
*  in the first part of the day without eating. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=309.92s)]
*  But I can't imagine going a whole day [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=311.96000000000004s)]
*  without doing it, to be honest. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=315.40000000000003s)]
*  He's got some bandwidth on him, man. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=316.44s)]
*  Yeah, he's a pretty strong-willed guy. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=317.96000000000004s)]
*  He's always so chipper, dude. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=320.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I'd love to get in and hang out with him. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=321.68s)]
*  That was probably, and he tells stories [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=323.28000000000003s)]
*  showing he'd be in the military and stuff. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=324.72s)]
*  Some of that stuff is bonkers. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=325.84000000000003s)]
*  Oh yeah, some of that stuff [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=327.44s)]
*  ain't gonna be repeated on here. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=328.6s)]
*  He makes me look calm. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=330.56s)]
*  Dude, that's the crazy part. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=331.76s)]
*  You start talking to him, you're like, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=333.24s)]
*  oh, well, some of this checks out. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=334.40000000000003s)]
*  For sure it checks out. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=336.24s)]
*  We don't need a DNA test in this family. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=337.6s)]
*  But you said they're moving down here? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=340.7s)]
*  Yeah, I'm trying to get them to. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=342.46000000000004s)]
*  We'll see how it goes, but I'm working on it. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=344.3s)]
*  I've been talking to him about it for a while. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=345.90000000000003s)]
*  But just somebody uprooting their entire life [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=349.7s)]
*  to come somewhere, but me and my sister live down here. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=352.54s)]
*  It's always tricky getting stuff like that to happen, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=355.02s)]
*  but we're working on it. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=358.78000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, that's a lot, man. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=360.54s)]
*  I know you have a son, Indio. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=364.14s)]
*  Indio, yeah. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=366.46000000000004s)]
*  His name's Indigo, but I call him Indy. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=367.3s)]
*  What's that been like, dude? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=369.86s)]
*  Because that's been probably one of the biggest things [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=371.22s)]
*  in your life, I'm sure. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=373.22s)]
*  I mean, outside of your, I mean, like, yeah, that's crazy. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=374.06s)]
*  Yeah, I think. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=377.34000000000003s)]
*  I don't even know how to ask that question. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=378.42s)]
*  I think it just gets better and better [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=379.26s)]
*  as the older he gets. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=380.46000000000004s)]
*  I mean, it's always been cool, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=381.74s)]
*  but when he's four years old now, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=382.78000000000003s)]
*  he'll be five this year. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=385.14s)]
*  Just the personality that keeps coming out [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=386.62s)]
*  and the relationship that you build. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=388.94s)]
*  And he's got a little sass on him. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=390.7s)]
*  He's got a little attitude, which is, I like. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=393.66s)]
*  I like that spunk. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=396.74s)]
*  Yesterday, my dad was telling him, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=399.62s)]
*  he was trying to get him to eat. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=403.26s)]
*  It's kind of a task to get him to eat, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=404.14s)]
*  to sit still long enough to eat, you know? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=406.06s)]
*  And my dad was like, hey man, if you don't eat, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=408.3s)]
*  I'm gonna put you in the bedroom. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=411.26s)]
*  You gotta go to sleep or whatever. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=413.22s)]
*  I don't know exactly what my dad said to him, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=414.54s)]
*  but he looked at my dad and he said, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=416.18s)]
*  I don't want you to stay here anymore. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=418.42s)]
*  All day, brother, wow. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=420.18s)]
*  But I just, I mean, like, it's just hilarious, you know? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=423.66s)]
*  When you're behind your dad, you're telling him, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=427.74s)]
*  like, keep telling him. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=428.78s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=429.82s)]
*  Just anything to keep him rocking, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=432.3s)]
*  but he's a sweetheart, but whenever you get him. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=434.21999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, oh yeah. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=436.9s)]
*  He's almost too sweet. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=438.5s)]
*  He's too nice to everyone. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=439.7s)]
*  Like people he doesn't know, you know? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=441.34s)]
*  Like, hey man, we don't like everybody, man. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=442.94s)]
*  We don't know these people, man. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=445.7s)]
*  Stranger danger, baby. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=448.21999999999997s)]
*  So I'm trying to teach him a little bit of that. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=449.74s)]
*  He's wild, definitely. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=451.41999999999996s)]
*  He emailed me the other day, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=452.97999999999996s)]
*  asking me to send him some zens. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=453.86s)]
*  I was like, dude, you gotta. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=455.26s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I couldn't believe he figured out, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=456.46s)]
*  you know, how to get a hold of the iPad like that. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=458.7s)]
*  I'm not really big on letting him, you know, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=461.41999999999996s)]
*  sit around with an iPad, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=464.06s)]
*  but I guess he got my nieces or something. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=465.18s)]
*  She probably had him send, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=468.38s)]
*  or he probably had hers send the email, you know? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=470.26s)]
*  Hey Haven, type this out for me. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=472.29999999999995s)]
*  Three's or six's? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=474.5s)]
*  Does he, yeah, yeah, does he have? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=479.46s)]
*  Three's or six's? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=483.17999999999995s)]
*  I just downgraded to the three's, man. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=484.5s)]
*  I'm weaning myself off. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=487.38s)]
*  Are you? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=488.22s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=489.06s)]
*  Might just be putting two in. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=489.90000000000003s)]
*  That's just a little bit of mouth math, homie. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=493.26s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=495.06s)]
*  But you'll see a dude with like 11 three's, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=495.90000000000003s)]
*  and I'm like, bitch, just get a damn 20 or something. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=499.34000000000003s)]
*  That's like Andrew. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=501.5s)]
*  Oh, your cousin? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=503.42s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=504.38s)]
*  He'll have a multitude in there. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=505.22s)]
*  He's only on the citrus though. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=509.58000000000004s)]
*  He's hilarious, dude. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=511.18s)]
*  Well, I'll ask you about him in a little bit, man. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=512.58s)]
*  All right. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=515.34s)]
*  Does your son have a favorite song of yours or anything? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=517.02s)]
*  Yeah, it's a song that's not out yet. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=518.8599999999999s)]
*  This album that I've been working on, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=520.9s)]
*  this is the first time where he's, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=523.3399999999999s)]
*  it seems like he's really starting to put two and two [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=524.8199999999999s)]
*  together, you know? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=527.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=528.54s)]
*  I would come home after I'd been writing, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=530.9s)]
*  and I'd show him songs this time. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=532.8599999999999s)]
*  This is the first time that he's ever cared. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=534.66s)]
*  And there's a song called Eyes Are Closed on my record, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=537.14s)]
*  and I brought it home that night. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=540.02s)]
*  We wrote it that day and took it home that night. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=542.66s)]
*  And I was just playing. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=544.3399999999999s)]
*  I wasn't really playing it for him. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=545.5799999999999s)]
*  I just had it kind of playing in the background [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=546.98s)]
*  because it was my first time hearing the demo [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=548.38s)]
*  of what we had just done that day. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=550.0999999999999s)]
*  And he was in the background, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=551.6999999999999s)]
*  and he kind of moseyed on over there [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=552.78s)]
*  and started being like, what's this? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=554.98s)]
*  And then after it was done, he said, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=557.62s)]
*  I like that song, daddy. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=559.66s)]
*  Really? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=560.86s)]
*  And it was like the first time he had ever done that. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=561.6999999999999s)]
*  So it was a special moment for me, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=563.66s)]
*  something I'll never forget. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=565.02s)]
*  And he said, play that again. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=566.14s)]
*  Oh, that's cool. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=568.14s)]
*  And I was like, yeah! [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=568.98s)]
*  This song's a hit for me no matter what. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=570.38s)]
*  So that was the first time I had really seen him, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=572.34s)]
*  like all those dots start connecting. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=577.46s)]
*  Yeah, I'll bet that's special. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=580.46s)]
*  For a while, he thought that Soul by John Michael Montgomery, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=582.4200000000001s)]
*  he thought that was me singing. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=586.1800000000001s)]
*  He was like, play daddy's fast song. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=587.5400000000001s)]
*  He called it the fast song. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=590.1800000000001s)]
*  Soul, I'm gonna let you in. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=591.58s)]
*  It's like I'm rolling. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=592.4200000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=593.26s)]
*  Hallelujah, I hear it. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=594.1s)]
*  He thought that was me singing. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=594.94s)]
*  I said, damn, man! [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=597.62s)]
*  I mean, that dude sounds pretty good, but come on. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=599.74s)]
*  And then he's just bidding on pigs at his daycare. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=603.3000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, probably. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=605.6600000000001s)]
*  Well, I went down to the Grumly County. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=607.82s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=609.86s)]
*  He called it the fast song. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=611.1800000000001s)]
*  And I finally broke it to him. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=612.4200000000001s)]
*  I said, that ain't me, dude. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=613.6600000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah, and the email he sent me, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=615.5400000000001s)]
*  he's like, yeah, you need to listen to my father's hit, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=617.5400000000001s)]
*  Cotton Eye Joe as well. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=619.1s)]
*  Oh yeah, well, we are from Knoxville. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=620.7s)]
*  He's seen that sign a few times. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=623.14s)]
*  That checks out, man. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=625.46s)]
*  As you make more music, so the new album, I'm the Problem, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=628.22s)]
*  as you make more music, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=632.38s)]
*  because you have been so prolific, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=634.3000000000001s)]
*  I think that's the word. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=636.26s)]
*  What does prolific mean? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=637.1800000000001s)]
*  I think that's the right word, too. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=638.58s)]
*  Okay. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=639.82s)]
*  But I don't know if either one of us should be. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=641.58s)]
*  If there were the dictionary guys? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=643.46s)]
*  Yeah, dude, definitely. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=645.0600000000001s)]
*  It's like a lot. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=649.0600000000001s)]
*  Producing much fruit. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=649.9s)]
*  Producing much fruit foliage or offspring, actually, it says. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=651.46s)]
*  I ain't been that prolific in that term, but yeah. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=655.6600000000001s)]
*  Presenting one plentiful, it says. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=658.22s)]
*  Producing many works. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=660.46s)]
*  Does it get tougher to like, okay, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=662.0600000000001s)]
*  how do I not have a song that sounds, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=664.02s)]
*  that's similar to a song I've previously had? [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=667.78s)]
*  Because when you have so many songs, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=669.46s)]
*  does that get a little bit tougher? [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=670.9s)]
*  What's that like? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=671.94s)]
*  Yeah, I think it does. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=672.78s)]
*  Like has there been a great song that you guys [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=674.22s)]
*  have put together and then you're like, oh man, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=676.58s)]
*  it's just a little too close to this? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=678.58s)]
*  Well, for this album, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=682.14s)]
*  I feel like I just didn't let it get to that point. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=683.58s)]
*  At least if I was a part of writing it. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=685.82s)]
*  I think, I can't remember exactly how many ones I was [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=687.62s)]
*  and wasn't a part of writing. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=690.86s)]
*  But if a song came in as a pitch, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=693.98s)]
*  I kind of knew immediately, I was like, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=697.26s)]
*  oh, these people are writing, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=698.66s)]
*  this might've made my last record, maybe. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=700.42s)]
*  Probably not, but you know, it's like, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=703.66s)]
*  that's what it felt like to me. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=706.98s)]
*  A lot of the pitches were that. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=709.42s)]
*  Yeah, because I guess people are just going, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=711.14s)]
*  they don't know where your next step is and who you are. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=712.5s)]
*  There was a select group of writers that I kind of [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=715.0600000000001s)]
*  told a little bit what I was trying to accomplish. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=718.1s)]
*  And I feel like that really helped me find a certain, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=721.1s)]
*  one of the sounds of that's on my record. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=724.4200000000001s)]
*  But for me, when I'm writing, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=726.7800000000001s)]
*  I kind of, you can kind of tell from the idea almost [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=728.0600000000001s)]
*  if the song is going to be similar or not. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=731.2600000000001s)]
*  And that was something that was tougher for me [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=733.46s)]
*  because a lot of the things that were successful [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=734.7800000000001s)]
*  and that were easy in the past were just like whiskey, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=738.5400000000001s)]
*  drinking, like all that stuff. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=741.1800000000001s)]
*  And I've kind of just almost explored every angle of that [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=742.7800000000001s)]
*  that's possible. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=746.22s)]
*  There's still some possible ways to get that in there. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=748.5s)]
*  But I tried to dig deeper, man. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=752.2199999999999s)]
*  And you know, a lot of my guys that I write with, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=754.1s)]
*  we kind of kept, at least for me, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=757.18s)]
*  when I was writing, we kept five or six guys. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=759.9399999999999s)]
*  We didn't always write together, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=761.6999999999999s)]
*  but that kind of core group of guys, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=763.02s)]
*  we all just had a good sense of what we were shooting for [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=765.5s)]
*  and just trying not to say the same thing [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=769.3s)]
*  that I've said before and incorporate new things. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=771.02s)]
*  So I feel like it was harder. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=773.66s)]
*  I had to work harder. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=776.42s)]
*  Like what do you mean, like finding new angles? [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=778.26s)]
*  Like drop in. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=781.26s)]
*  Yeah, just finding new angles and just thinking up ideas. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=782.0999999999999s)]
*  And there's, you know, or just maybe somebody had an idea [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=783.6999999999999s)]
*  and they brought it in and I'm like, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=787.9s)]
*  well, that's pretty good. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=789.38s)]
*  But like trying to find a way to make it something different. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=790.26s)]
*  It sounds like that idea would have been [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=795.4599999999999s)]
*  on the last record, but maybe I can flip this [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=797.26s)]
*  or flip that into making it something that's more unique. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=799.02s)]
*  So just trying to dig deeper and not just saying, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=802.5s)]
*  oh yeah, not just being content with something. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=805.3s)]
*  Oh yeah, taking it easy. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=807.5s)]
*  Yeah, just digging deeper. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=808.74s)]
*  Cause you can kind of, yeah, it's funny. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=810.18s)]
*  I was talking to Charlie Hanson the other night. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=811.74s)]
*  Dude, that guy, bro, him and Marissa, is that is Marissa? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=814.42s)]
*  Yeah, Marissa, yeah. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=817.98s)]
*  Bro, they're hilarious, bro. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=818.98s)]
*  They are hilarious. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=821.02s)]
*  She's so funny, dude. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=821.9399999999999s)]
*  She kind of keeps him in check, I feel like. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=824.74s)]
*  The pairing, both of them, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=827.1s)]
*  cause he's kind of so kind of rough around the edges. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=829.58s)]
*  Like, I don't, maybe that's a crazy, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=832.22s)]
*  it's not a crazy thing to say about him. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=833.98s)]
*  No, definitely not. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=835.5s)]
*  I think he'd probably agree with that. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=836.34s)]
*  Yeah, he's just so, he's so real. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=837.3800000000001s)]
*  He's pretty blunt guy. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=841.1s)]
*  Yes. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=842.1s)]
*  Pretty blunt. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=842.94s)]
*  Yes, he is. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=843.7800000000001s)]
*  Which I've always loved that about him. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=844.6s)]
*  When he first got to town, I guess that was probably, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=845.82s)]
*  shoot, we wrote, if I know me. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=848.7s)]
*  I mean, it had to be either 17 or 18 when I first met him. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=851.34s)]
*  Wow. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=854.3000000000001s)]
*  And 2017 or 18, not when I was 17 or 18 years old, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=855.1400000000001s)]
*  but he kind of, I think he came from LA [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=858.62s)]
*  so he had like this, I don't know, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=863.98s)]
*  I guess it's different out there. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=866.86s)]
*  It seems like it's like a dick measuring contest [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=868.7800000000001s)]
*  out there a lot. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=870.9000000000001s)]
*  Well, people are probably, yeah, that could be true. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=872.1800000000001s)]
*  And I think he had brought a lot of that mindset [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=874.5s)]
*  to Nashville, and whenever we were first writing, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=877.0200000000001s)]
*  I'm like, hey man, you ain't gotta be like that. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=879.7s)]
*  Like, it ain't like that here. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=883.2600000000001s)]
*  So we just, and I would give him a hard time [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=885.4200000000001s)]
*  when he would be acting like that. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=887.98s)]
*  I'd always talk shit and stuff. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=888.98s)]
*  So we just became instant friends, like that kind of friend. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=890.48s)]
*  I could see that 100%, dude. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=892.5799999999999s)]
*  Cause what did I say? [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=894.86s)]
*  Oh, he'd gotten married, right? [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=895.78s)]
*  And his wife one night, I think that she probably [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=896.9s)]
*  had a cocktail or two and invited me to their wedding, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=898.8199999999999s)]
*  right? [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=901.02s)]
*  And I had to work that weekend. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=901.86s)]
*  But I saw pictures you win, I think Hardy win. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=903.98s)]
*  It looked like a good time. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=905.9399999999999s)]
*  I mean, it was a beautiful wedding, man. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=906.86s)]
*  I mean, really, really beautiful. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=908.14s)]
*  It was on an island somewhere. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=910.86s)]
*  Yeah, an island of Marotta. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=911.9399999999999s)]
*  It was like, you know, you heard of that show, Bloodline? [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=912.9s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=916.14s)]
*  It was that compound where that was filmed. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=916.98s)]
*  Oh damn. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=919.6999999999999s)]
*  So it was legit. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=920.54s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=922.06s)]
*  Yeah, but, and then so when I saw him, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=923.3s)]
*  I said, hey man, I'm sorry I couldn't make it [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=924.9399999999999s)]
*  to the wedding. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=926.18s)]
*  He's like, well, you know, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=927.02s)]
*  we weren't really expecting you there. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=928.8199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know if they, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=930.18s)]
*  I was in the damn wedding, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=931.46s)]
*  and I don't know if they was expecting me there. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=932.46s)]
*  I showed up about an hour before it was supposed to start [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=934.22s)]
*  and left before it was over. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=936.34s)]
*  But I was proud to be there, man. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=938.02s)]
*  It was cool. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=940.8199999999999s)]
*  I really appreciated it. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=941.66s)]
*  It was cool. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=943.3s)]
*  But he's just like, look, man, [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=944.14s)]
*  we don't super know each other that good, he said. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=945.14s)]
*  But it was so like just the realest shit ever. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=948.02s)]
*  He's like, and if we become better friends and, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=950.58s)]
*  you know, and that happens, then yeah, man, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=952.6600000000001s)]
*  I'd expect you to be at my, you know, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=954.4200000000001s)]
*  if I get divorced or if I do a renew of the vows. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=956.1s)]
*  I said, but it was just. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=959.34s)]
*  I'd expect you to be at my divorcing now. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=960.5400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but it was just like, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=962.1800000000001s)]
*  and I was like, dude, you're so right. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=964.14s)]
*  I was like, and it didn't make me want to get to know him [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=965.46s)]
*  more because it was like just cutting through the bullshit. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=967.6600000000001s)]
*  I love that. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=970.58s)]
*  He's, that's a definite, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=971.4200000000001s)]
*  that's an accurate way of describing him. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=972.82s)]
*  Which I think is probably what makes him a good songwriter [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=974.34s)]
*  too, cause it's like, you gotta like, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=977.3000000000001s)]
*  if you too much bull, it's like, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=979.5s)]
*  if you can cut through the bullshit. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=981.34s)]
*  Well, yeah, he's, he's, he'll definitely tell you like, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=982.38s)]
*  or if you're, if you're on something, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=986.46s)]
*  he's like, man, that sucks, you know? [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=987.6600000000001s)]
*  And that's what I mean. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=989.34s)]
*  I feel like I have a pretty good gauge of, you know, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=990.58s)]
*  what's good and what's not, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=992.74s)]
*  but like it's, it's nice to have another person in the room [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=993.7s)]
*  who will tell you straight up, you know? [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=996.4200000000001s)]
*  Cause especially when you, when you do get to like, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=998.02s)]
*  get to this level, people sometimes don't check you [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1000.58s)]
*  the way they should, you know? [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1002.9000000000001s)]
*  They'll just let you rock with it and you know, whatever. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1004.3000000000001s)]
*  Damn dude. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1007.4200000000001s)]
*  Well, it's just interesting to hear you say that. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1008.26s)]
*  I had a guy a few years ago, I was, I'd taken out a guy, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1011.14s)]
*  we went to lunch and he's married and we're both straight, [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1013.86s)]
*  but we went and had lunch together and- [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1017.9s)]
*  Thanks for clarifying, man. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1020.66s)]
*  But yeah, he was just, he's been like a manager [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1021.66s)]
*  of like some of the most popular comedians over time. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1024.26s)]
*  And I was talking to him and he goes, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1026.58s)]
*  well, you kind of have to evolve with your audience. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1027.74s)]
*  He's like, if you, you know, going back to kind of, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1029.7s)]
*  kind of what you said earlier about like, you know, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1031.62s)]
*  some people probably present songs to you [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1033.58s)]
*  that would have been great an album or two ago. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1036.54s)]
*  It's like, damn, that would have been, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1038.1799999999998s)]
*  but it's like you- [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1039.3799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you can't blame, you can't blame them. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1040.22s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1042.02s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1042.86s)]
*  You can't expect them to know what's in your head [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1043.6799999999998s)]
*  and what you're going to do next. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1044.86s)]
*  Yeah, and they only have like the footprints [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1046.34s)]
*  that they've seen you leave so far make [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1048.1399999999999s)]
*  that they can even judge on. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1050.06s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1051.5s)]
*  Like I've heard Wasted On You, I've heard that 2.0 [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1052.34s)]
*  18,000 times, you know, in my inbox. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1055.46s)]
*  A lot of them don't even make it to me [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1060.5s)]
*  because it gets snipped before it even gets to me. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1061.78s)]
*  But I've heard plenty of them, you know? [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1063.82s)]
*  Oh yeah, for sure. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1066.34s)]
*  I understand it, but you know, [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1067.1799999999998s)]
*  you can't settle like that. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1069.6599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1071.3s)]
*  But you also don't want to go too far either. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1072.1399999999999s)]
*  Cause then your fans are like, dude, you know, what's- [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1075.34s)]
*  Yeah, what's his name, Chris Gaines? [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1077.78s)]
*  Is he just taking a lot of mushrooms or something? [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1079.86s)]
*  You know, like you can get that guy too. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1081.4199999999998s)]
*  This man at one time, he said, he goes, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1083.6599999999999s)]
*  one thing you have to evolve with your audience, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1085.5s)]
*  if you try to hide that you're evolving [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1087.86s)]
*  or that you're growing, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1089.78s)]
*  cause your audience also grows, right? [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1091.1s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1092.8999999999999s)]
*  So he's like, if you try, it can be a trap sometimes [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1094.66s)]
*  to try to just fit your current feet [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1096.54s)]
*  back in your old footprints. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1099.6200000000001s)]
*  And I just thought it was interesting to hear somebody say [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1100.86s)]
*  that I'd never really thought about. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1102.38s)]
*  Cause sometimes you're like, oh, this worked [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1104.02s)]
*  and I gotta stay right here, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1105.42s)]
*  but you're not there anymore, you know? [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1107.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1109.86s)]
*  And I mean, even if it's just subtle changes, [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1110.7s)]
*  it don't have to be like huge things, you know? [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1112.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1114.9s)]
*  You don't have to come out and do like a Mozart style. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1115.74s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1117.54s)]
*  You know, like my last album, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1118.38s)]
*  I had plenty of trap beats and stuff like that. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1119.5s)]
*  This time I was like, hey man, let's just, [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1121.66s)]
*  let's tone that back a little bit. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1124.5s)]
*  I'm tired of it. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1125.34s)]
*  I'm tired of hearing it. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1126.1799999999998s)]
*  So if I'm tired of it, they probably tired of hearing it. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1127.02s)]
*  You know, so just like certain things that [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1129.02s)]
*  you can still get that same swag or that same, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1131.1399999999999s)]
*  you can accomplish certain things [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1133.1399999999999s)]
*  without doing the same exact thing, you know? [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1134.3799999999999s)]
*  So it's just simple stuff like that in some cases. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1136.9399999999998s)]
*  Do you feel like you've always had a pretty good like [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1139.9799999999998s)]
*  instinct about that kind of stuff? [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1142.3799999999999s)]
*  Like, is that something that you think you really have? [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1143.78s)]
*  Like you kind of can feel? [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1145.3s)]
*  I like to think so, man. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1147.1399999999999s)]
*  I feel like I can tell when something's getting tired, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1148.3799999999999s)]
*  you know? [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1151.02s)]
*  And... [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1152.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1153.1s)]
*  I don't... [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1154.1s)]
*  That's a gift, man. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1154.9399999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I guess so. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1156.02s)]
*  Maybe God gave me that. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1157.02s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1158.1399999999999s)]
*  I've also learned from people in my, you know, [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1159.4199999999998s)]
*  that I've been around for the last 10 years [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1162.26s)]
*  who I feel like I've learned from [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1163.82s)]
*  and that have helped me with that as well. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1165.9399999999998s)]
*  You know, I don't think I was just fully just, [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1167.54s)]
*  I think I had a knack for it already, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1170.1399999999999s)]
*  but I think I've, you know, [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1171.78s)]
*  developed it and learned from people as well. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1172.98s)]
*  So, yeah. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1174.74s)]
*  I've always had a tough time, like, [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1175.98s)]
*  cause I've always been like a do it yourself kind of guy. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1178.78s)]
*  Like, I feel like I know what I'm doing. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1180.54s)]
*  Like, I work hard. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1182.06s)]
*  But then recently I've had to like, [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1183.4199999999998s)]
*  realize I need help more. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1186.1s)]
*  It's like, I can't always give this guy a hard time. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1187.34s)]
*  I need it. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1190.7s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1191.54s)]
*  Like, I can't always butt up against every wall, you know? [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1192.3799999999999s)]
*  Cause I'll just do that. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1194.4199999999998s)]
*  It's just my nature. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1195.26s)]
*  Cause I don't want help a lot of times. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1196.1s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1197.6599999999999s)]
*  Man, that shit has been... [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1198.54s)]
*  That's a big deal. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1199.7s)]
*  Yeah, it's been getting better though recently. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1201.3799999999999s)]
*  Even just like, just little things. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1203.26s)]
*  I just started noticing it's getting a little bit better. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1205.62s)]
*  And the irony is everything's been easier. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1207.3s)]
*  The more I let help come in. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1211.06s)]
*  I think there's certain areas in my life, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1212.7s)]
*  like with music, I've always kind of, [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1214.78s)]
*  I've been a good teammate. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1216.94s)]
*  I don't know why that is. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1219.06s)]
*  You know, maybe I've just always, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1220.7s)]
*  like the, I like the aspect of feeling like you're on a team. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1222.82s)]
*  I guess cause I played sports and stuff so much growing up. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1227.3s)]
*  You know, like for me, I enjoy the camaraderie [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1229.26s)]
*  of making music with my buddies and doing all that stuff. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1231.74s)]
*  You know, so I've always kind of enjoyed the help [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1233.86s)]
*  and the team aspect of that. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1237.7s)]
*  But there's other areas in my life [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1238.8999999999999s)]
*  where I'm like you, where I'm like, I don't, you know, [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1240.9s)]
*  whatever, no, no, no, I'm good. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1243.46s)]
*  Yeah, I'm good. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1245.14s)]
*  Yeah, so it doesn't necessarily permeate [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1245.98s)]
*  throughout my entire life. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1248.8600000000001s)]
*  It's just that one thing where I've been able to do that. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1249.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1253.42s)]
*  Oh dude, I'll be sitting in the damn bottom of a hole. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1254.3000000000002s)]
*  There'll be a thousand people out there with rope [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1257.42s)]
*  and I'll be like, I'm good. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1259.0600000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I'll find one. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1260.0600000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I'll find, I'll figure something. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1261.74s)]
*  There's one down here somewhere. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1262.9s)]
*  And they'll be up there and they're like, [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1265.9s)]
*  just willing to help. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1267.5800000000002s)]
*  They're like, this dude's an idiot. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1268.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1269.74s)]
*  Yeah, you're damn right. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1270.98s)]
*  Yeah, I'm proud of it too. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1271.82s)]
*  Yeah, I'm proud of it. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1273.66s)]
*  That's the best part. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1275.14s)]
*  Is it tough in your life? [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1277.94s)]
*  I mean, dude, your music, it's like, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1279.1000000000001s)]
*  it's just been such a wave that like, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1281.42s)]
*  I mean, you couldn't travel around town [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1283.9s)]
*  without seeing every guy at a stoplight look like, [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1286.26s)]
*  you know, look like a Morgan Wall and look like a, [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1289.66s)]
*  or hear your music every store. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1293.26s)]
*  Are there moments for you where it's like, God, [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1295.78s)]
*  this guy's got a tonic? [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1297.6200000000001s)]
*  It's like, where it almost, [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1299.1s)]
*  where you become too much for you? [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1300.3s)]
*  Like, is that ever, does that make any sense? [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1302.02s)]
*  Yeah, no, it does. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1304.1799999999998s)]
*  It's still weird and there's parts of that [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1306.1s)]
*  that I don't like. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1308.86s)]
*  I mean, I think anybody who has to deal with that, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1309.6999999999998s)]
*  it's not ideal, you know, it's not ideal to go everywhere. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1312.6599999999999s)]
*  And even if you don't get like, you know, bothered, [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1315.1399999999999s)]
*  you were on edge the whole time [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1318.06s)]
*  because you thought you might. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1320.3s)]
*  It's like, there's just not a lot of, [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1321.3s)]
*  there's things that you just don't do. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1324.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1327.2199999999998s)]
*  You just don't do them anymore. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1328.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1329.1s)]
*  You know, but that's okay. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1329.94s)]
*  That's why I've taken up hunting so much, I think, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1330.78s)]
*  you know, because I can go be with my buddies. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1333.1s)]
*  I'm in the middle of nowhere. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1335.1399999999999s)]
*  I can be at ease. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1336.62s)]
*  I can not stress out. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1338.54s)]
*  You just find ways to supplement it, I think, you know. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1341.3799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1344.1s)]
*  Yeah, it's kind of funny that you can't really go [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1344.94s)]
*  to a bar anymore because there'd be too much hassle [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1346.8999999999999s)]
*  and it's probably best thing for you. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1349.74s)]
*  It's definitely the best thing for me, you know. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1351.94s)]
*  I mean, if you're using a bar as a specific example, [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1353.94s)]
*  that's definitely the best thing for me. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1358.46s)]
*  I ain't been in a bar since the last time I was in a bar [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1361.6200000000001s)]
*  that everybody knows about. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1368.22s)]
*  That feels like a bar right there. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1370.7800000000002s)]
*  It does. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1372.02s)]
*  I ain't been in a bar since the last time. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1372.8600000000001s)]
*  It sounds like an old country song for sure. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1373.94s)]
*  But yeah, that's the most public time I was in a bar. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1378.26s)]
*  That's the last time I was in a bar. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1382.7s)]
*  Dude, have you seen those, [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1384.3400000000001s)]

*  He was in jail. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1746.86s)]
*  Did he? [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1748.06s)]
*  I think so. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1749.06s)]
*  Not a long time. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1749.86s)]
*  Not long enough. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1750.86s)]
*  I went to jail too, man. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1751.6599999999999s)]
*  Hey, if you're behind bars, write a couple. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1757.86s)]
*  No, it was kind of spur of the moment thing, though. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1762.86s)]
*  I got a song on my record called Miami. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1764.86s)]
*  I haven't heard that one yet. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1768.06s)]
*  They sent me a couple of the songs. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1769.06s)]
*  Did they? [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1770.06s)]
*  Yeah, it's cool, man. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1770.46s)]
*  Miami, it's like a Keith Whitley flip. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1771.46s)]
*  So it's like an old Miami, Miami, that song. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1774.26s)]
*  Have you ever heard that? [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1776.6599999999999s)]
*  Miami, Miami, what took you so long I don't you never call? [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1777.66s)]
*  Oh, no, I've never seen it. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1786.26s)]
*  People talk about Keith Whitley. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1787.26s)]
*  That's one of his bigger type songs, I guess. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1788.26s)]
*  But we flipped it and turned it into more of like a, [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1790.66s)]
*  it's a little more like rap style. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1793.0600000000002s)]
*  But it's cool, man. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1795.46s)]
*  I like it. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1797.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1798.26s)]
*  It's cool. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1798.66s)]
*  It seemed like it could use a rapper on there. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1799.26s)]
*  I didn't end up using a feature. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1802.26s)]
*  We ended up just making a second verse. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1803.46s)]
*  But it's one of those songs where I could, [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1805.06s)]
*  it wouldn't be surprising if we got like a remix and did that. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1807.6599999999999s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1811.46s)]
*  Once it's out and all that stuff. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1811.86s)]
*  What you're famous, like you guys had this whole time, [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1813.26s)]
*  like these different walkouts that you did over the years. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1816.86s)]
*  Right. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1819.46s)]
*  Really fun. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1819.86s)]
*  And thanks for letting me be part of the one in Nashville. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1820.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1822.26s)]
*  What would do you have a favorite one that kind of stood out to you [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1824.06s)]
*  and no judgment to any of them? [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1826.46s)]
*  What was it? [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1827.46s)]
*  I mean, Neelan Stadium is, you know, that's my home. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1827.86s)]
*  That's where I grew up. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1831.6599999999999s)]
*  And put those pads on. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1833.26s)]
*  Peyton, that one was really good. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1834.86s)]
*  The baseball team when we did was really good too. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1836.06s)]
*  But that Peyton one, that was one of the, you know, it's hard to beat. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1837.86s)]
*  Anything that happened those two nights at that stadium, [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1842.6599999999999s)]
*  I find myself just being like, yeah, that's pretty, those are like the, [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1845.86s)]
*  you know, some of the best memories I've had. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1850.4599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1852.4599999999998s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1853.86s)]
*  With shows. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1854.4599999999998s)]
*  So sick. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1855.06s)]
*  He's so ridiculous. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1857.06s)]
*  He came out looking like he was actually about to go play with his facial expressions and stuff. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1857.6599999999999s)]
*  Hey, I think half the boosters wanted to sign some boosters. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1862.86s)]
*  I think we're trying to holler at him. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1866.6599999999999s)]
*  Probably. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1867.86s)]
*  Hey, man, you got another year eligibility. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1869.26s)]
*  We'll find something else. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1871.26s)]
*  Yeah, man, that was special, dude. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1874.26s)]
*  So cool. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1875.86s)]
*  Yeah, but the walkouts are, they're just the energy that comes from those. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1877.26s)]
*  It just could last you. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1881.6599999999999s)]
*  I mean, maybe not the entire show, but it'll last you a while, you know. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1883.86s)]
*  And then once you get out there and compound the energy that comes along with the actual show, [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1886.6599999999999s)]
*  it's just, it's a rush. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1891.66s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1895.0600000000002s)]
*  Yeah, there's that coach right there that we put that water on. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1896.8600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, Hypal. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1899.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1900.46s)]
*  Oh, he's thugging. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1901.46s)]
*  He's big thugging right there. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1902.26s)]
*  He was, dude. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1903.26s)]
*  What else has happened? [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1906.0600000000002s)]
*  So you have your, the first time you're going to play your new album will be at Sand in My Boots Fest? [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1906.8600000000001s)]
*  I'll play some of my album there. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1914.0600000000002s)]
*  Okay. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1915.66s)]
*  You know, the album comes out on the 16th. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1917.46s)]
*  I play on the 18th. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1918.8600000000001s)]
*  I'll probably, I'll play some of the new stuff. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1920.86s)]
*  That's another thing, man. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1923.86s)]
*  It's hard to, it's hard picking setlist at this point too. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1925.06s)]
*  Oh. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1928.86s)]
*  You know, that gets real tricky. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1929.86s)]
*  Do you do that yourself? [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1931.4599999999998s)]
*  You kind of organize it? [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1932.4599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, me and my band do it together. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1933.4599999999998s)]
*  You know, it's, a lot of it's data driven, you know, because you can see, you know, which songs people, [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1938.26s)]
*  the majority of people want to hear. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1947.06s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1949.4599999999998s)]
*  You're always going to miss somebody's favorite song. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1950.26s)]
*  You're probably going to miss my favorite song, you know, in some sets. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1952.46s)]
*  Just trying to figure out a way this year since I'm, you know, I'm only playing 20 shows. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1957.46s)]
*  So probably if I can try to figure out a way to not play the same setlist all the time, you know, [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1961.26s)]
*  because last year I had to interchange a couple, but I think it's going to be, [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1968.86s)]
*  I'm going to make a bigger effort to try to make the setlist different for at least each night, [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1974.06s)]
*  you know, maybe not every single show be a different setlist, but like night one, night two. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1979.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1983.66s)]
*  Because we're playing two nights in each place. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1984.26s)]
*  So a night, you know, trying to separate the two nights as far as music goes should be, [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1985.86s)]
*  should be interesting because we've never done that before. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1991.86s)]
*  We would always just do like maybe change one or two songs, you know, [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1994.26s)]
*  I'm thinking maybe a little more than that. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1997.26s)]
*  So I like that. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1998.66s)]
*  Yeah, that way if he wanted to come for both nights too, they could hear different stuff. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=1999.66s)]
*  Yeah, and a lot of people already do come both nights. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2002.46s)]
*  So that would be nice for them too. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2004.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2005.46s)]
*  There's really no way to do it perfectly. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2006.46s)]
*  Somebody's going to be disappointed or, you know, at any point, [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2008.86s)]
*  oh, they didn't play this song or they didn't play that song, but trying our best. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2012.26s)]
*  I'm not going to play for four hours either. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2015.06s)]
*  So, you know, you got to keep it within reason. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2016.6599999999999s)]
*  We got to meet in the middle guys. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2020.4599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2021.6599999999999s)]
*  I'll do my best. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2022.6599999999999s)]
*  I don't want to sing for four hours, you know, two hours about maybe a little longer two hours. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2023.4599999999998s)]
*  You put it on, man. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2029.4599999999998s)]
*  I like my show, like I'll be out there for maybe about an hour and 15 minutes is probably the sweet spot for me to be on stage. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2030.4599999999998s)]
*  I think with a comedian where they're just because we don't have any backup instruments. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2037.06s)]
*  So people are like, fuck somebody tap in a violin or something with this bastard. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2040.46s)]
*  You know, people get a little bit tired. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2044.26s)]
*  But I can't and that burns me out, man. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2046.26s)]
*  I used to do two shows now only do one a night, but I can't imagine two shows in one night. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2048.66s)]
*  Yeah, back to back. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2053.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2055.2599999999998s)]
*  When you first started as a, I think I remember you telling me that. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2056.06s)]
*  Yeah, I think like even whenever I first came to town, you guys came one night and and saw me at Zanies. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2058.46s)]
*  Yeah, that was cool. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2063.2599999999998s)]
*  You came to my podcast early, man, and that helped me. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2064.66s)]
*  It helped give me some just support in the community. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2067.66s)]
*  I didn't even realize it was early because to me, I'd been listening to you for like a little while. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2071.46s)]

*  Golly. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2106.46s)]
*  We bought some better lights. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2107.46s)]
*  Looking pasty boy. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2109.66s)]
*  What's up with the free time now? [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2113.2599999999998s)]
*  So you go hunting. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2115.2599999999998s)]
*  Where do you guys like to go? [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2116.46s)]
*  Well, all over the place, man. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2118.06s)]
*  I got a farm outside of town that we've been planting and getting all the agriculture right. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2119.86s)]
*  I don't think you've been to my farm. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2131.26s)]
*  Have you? [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2132.46s)]
*  Oh, no, I may have been your house. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2133.46s)]
*  Yeah, you just been to my house, I believe. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2134.46s)]
*  But yeah, so we got we got deer and turkeys down there. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2135.46s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2138.26s)]
*  So that's that's pretty much what it's geared towards. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2139.26s)]
*  It's a really good we we bought it. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2141.86s)]
*  It was already a really good turkey farm. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2144.06s)]
*  And then we've just been adding a lot of the agriculture and all that stuff to try to make it a better deer farm. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2147.06s)]
*  What makes a good setup like that? [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2153.46s)]
*  Like, what's the best way to make it set up where it's challenging to the hunter? [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2155.2599999999998s)]
*  But also, like, I mean, it's always going to be challenging when deer hunting just, you know, because you only get to kill two two bucks in a in a season in a state, you know, so you're not you're not just going to go out there and shoot everything you see. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2159.06s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2172.8599999999997s)]
*  Like you may let a really good deer walk because you're trying to get a better you know that there's a better deer in the area or you believe there's a better deer in there. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2173.8599999999997s)]
*  You know, like we have cameras and stuff now so we can kind of take inventory on stuff. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2182.8599999999997s)]
*  But you're not you don't I think people I don't know what people think about hunting, but like you don't just go out there and just massacre animals. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2186.66s)]
*  You know, I mean, I don't know if it was a handgun or not. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2194.46s)]
*  No, but I mean, it's a it's interesting. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2196.2599999999998s)]
*  I mean, the main thing is food, you know, food and bedding. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2200.26s)]
*  That's that's really all it that's what those are the two main things that you need to have a good hunting farm. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2203.46s)]
*  Okay. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2208.46s)]
*  As long as you got there, the type of bedding that they want and preferably the type of food that they want, then you're going to keep those deer on your farm because they ain't going to they don't need to leave to go find either one of those. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2209.46s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2220.46s)]
*  They're happy. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2221.46s)]
*  So they'll stay in their home range and they'll stay there and you can grow them. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2222.46s)]
*  You know, like we don't want to at least try to get them to be five years old. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2223.46s)]
*  That's minimum that what we want to do, you know, depending on where you're at in the country, people will let them get older. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2228.46s)]
*  It's a little different, I think, depending on your land, depending because, you know, like if you if you spend all this time and money and then you got your neighbor who if your deer walks across to their property line, they might shoot it before you. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2235.46s)]
*  You were planning on shooting it. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2248.46s)]
*  So, you know, it's a little bit of it can be a little bit of a game. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2250.0600000000004s)]
*  So there can be property be property line beef like that. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2254.46s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2257.0600000000004s)]
*  I mean, there's a lot of hunting property line beef. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2258.86s)]
*  And what about reindeer? [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2261.86s)]
*  Do you ever see reindeer out there? [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2262.86s)]
*  I personally came across one. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2263.86s)]
*  My son did just get a reindeer call and one of my one of my buddies from from Alabama made him a reindeer call. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2266.86s)]
*  Oh, wait for Christmas. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2274.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2275.66s)]
*  Oh, it's hilarious. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2276.66s)]
*  That's cool. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2277.66s)]
*  Well, you got to use that with him. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2278.66s)]
*  That's pretty cool. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2279.66s)]
*  Imagine that, do you? [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2280.66s)]
*  You're a kid and you think it was a nice reindeer call you're bringing in Santa, dude. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2281.66s)]
*  Yeah, he thinks that's what he's doing. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2285.46s)]
*  I mean, that's that would be I don't even think he's actually tried it like he I guess that was probably the last last Christmas. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2287.26s)]
*  So he's just he's came. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2295.46s)]
*  He's just got a lot of new interest and stuff this year. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2297.46s)]
*  So I think I was I came home this this past weekend and I was working on my turkey call just in my mouth, you know, and he was trying to like mimic me and stuff. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2300.0600000000004s)]
*  It was hilarious. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2308.0600000000004s)]
*  He's just screaming basically. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2310.46s)]
*  Is it fun to watch him kind of grow? [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2314.46s)]
*  Like what does it been interesting? [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2316.26s)]
*  Is there moments where you see him learn something and you almost see him learn it? [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2317.46s)]
*  Like does that kind of happen? [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2320.46s)]
*  Yeah, it's cool. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2321.6600000000003s)]
*  Like I've been working on him on how to catch and stuff. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2322.46s)]
*  You know, I've just been using like a soft basketball that I've got one of those, you know, just basketball goals. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2326.0600000000004s)]
*  You hang up on the door and oh, yeah, there's just so much fun. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2332.46s)]
*  I use it more than him still. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2334.86s)]
*  Yeah, you just make it a brief. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2336.6600000000003s)]
*  I'm just yeah, every time I'm on a phone, I'll just put my headphones in and just start shooting for like 30 minutes. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2339.46s)]
*  Since it's been cold, especially. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2346.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2347.6600000000003s)]
*  But yeah, just you know, when I first when we first started, he couldn't do it. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2350.0600000000004s)]
*  And then, you know, a couple weeks later, he's like catching and you know, you can catch a bounce pass now. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2354.46s)]
*  You know, it's just like just seeing those things progress in such a short period of time is cool. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2359.6600000000003s)]
*  Does it make you have a different appreciation for your own dad or is it just a y'all's relationship? [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2364.26s)]
*  Any you think is that a weird question to ask? [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2367.6600000000003s)]
*  No, it's not a weird question. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2369.26s)]
*  I think. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2370.46s)]
*  Yeah, I think it probably does. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2372.86s)]
*  You know, I mean, me and my dad, we butted heads a lot growing up, especially once I got to high school, just because I was I was you were you. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2374.86s)]
*  I was kind of ridiculous. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2382.06s)]
*  And I think he was kind of ridiculous when he was that when he was that age, too. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2383.26s)]
*  So he was just trying to hey, don't be like me when I was that age, you know, like I know what this turns. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2387.6600000000003s)]
*  I know how this ends usually. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2392.6600000000003s)]
*  So we just butted heads. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2394.06s)]
*  I didn't you know, you don't believe anything your parents say when you know it is the last person you want to believe it's so crazy. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2395.86s)]
*  Not even possible. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2400.26s)]
*  I there wasn't possible in my head to believe that. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2401.06s)]
*  That's crazy to think now. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2403.66s)]
*  I'm like, damn, they were right. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2404.8599999999997s)]
*  But in my head, it was not physically possible to think that they could be right. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2406.06s)]
*  It just wasn't. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2410.8599999999997s)]
*  It's kind of crazy because like, oh, these two people that love me and care about me and raised me this far. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2411.66s)]
*  They're trying to ruin my life. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2416.46s)]
*  Yeah, that's what you think. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2419.06s)]

*  It's insane, really. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2421.46s)]
*  But that's what I thought. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2422.66s)]
*  But yeah, I mean, after you know, I moved out and once I really once I think I got moved down here to Nashville, that's when we became closer. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2424.8599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, closer than ever because I moved here pretty young. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2433.66s)]
*  You know, I was 22 when I moved here. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2435.8599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, and almost been here 10 years coming up. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2437.46s)]
*  Mm hmm. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2440.46s)]
*  So it's I think just having that space and then just being able to get older too, you know, and you know, that's the biggest thing. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2441.06s)]
*  You're like, oh, shit, no, that other shit even matter. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2448.06s)]
*  I can't you may maybe you could have went about it a little different or whatever. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2450.06s)]
*  You know, like the intentions were right. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2453.46s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I just got to spend time with my mom is like a lot of my life. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=2455.2599999999998s)]

*  That bitch pulled up slow, dude. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3031.36s)]
*  It's got a two cylinder in it. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3035.36s)]
*  Probably had a fucking outboard motor engine in it. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3039.36s)]
*  You had to steer it like with the reverse way, like you had to do a John Boat. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3043.36s)]
*  Yeah, it had a boat motor in it too. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3048.36s)]

*  No, it had three extra little seats in the back. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3061.36s)]
*  Oh, okay, okay. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3063.36s)]
*  But they weren't even a bench. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3064.36s)]
*  It was three individual little bitty seats. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3065.36s)]
*  Three booster seats up there? [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3069.36s)]
*  You either had to have three kids that were triplets, I guess, or a couple small buddies. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3072.36s)]
*  But somebody had stole my damn passenger seat, dude. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3077.36s)]
*  Did you ever get it back? [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3080.36s)]
*  Uh-uh. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3081.36s)]
*  Somebody were eating at a Burger King and somebody stole that bitch out of there. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3082.36s)]
*  But then people had to get in the car, but they couldn't sit right there. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3086.36s)]
*  Did you put a couple blankets down or something? [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3095.36s)]
*  I don't know, whatever, dude. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3097.36s)]
*  But the one time I picked up a dude, I was getting him to buy me alcohol at a gas station. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3098.36s)]
*  I was skipping school. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3103.36s)]
*  And he got in, this kind of homeless-y kind of guy. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3104.36s)]
*  And he got in. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3107.36s)]
*  Instead of sitting in the back, he just got on his knees right there at the passenger side. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3108.36s)]
*  So I'm driving and he just... [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3113.36s)]
*  He was your friend? [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3115.36s)]
*  No, no. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3116.36s)]

*  I just cleaned out my car. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3125.36s)]

*  That's not true. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3128.36s)]

*  and we, Jelly Roll was here, and we hadn't charged the batteries [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3199.36s)]
*  for the audio recorders and they gave up halfway through it. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3204.36s)]

*  Does it feel, is there a moment where you feel that the album is finished? [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3327.36s)]
*  Is there a moment where you're like, I just can't, this is far enough? [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3331.36s)]
*  Could you keep going on and out and could you keep fine-tuning it forever? [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3334.36s)]
*  Yes, for sure. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3338.36s)]
*  So that's a real possibility you can overdo it? [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3339.36s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3341.36s)]
*  The powers that be will give you a deadline if you want certain things to happen. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3343.36s)]
*  You know, like you want your vinyl to come to be out, to be ready by when the record's ready. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3350.36s)]
*  Things like that. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3356.36s)]
*  So you kind of, they give you a buffer because they know you're not going to have it in time. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3358.36s)]
*  They got a buffer for the buffer. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3364.36s)]
*  They got like an eight-week buffer, I think, that they put on me. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3366.36s)]
*  But those time limits are healthy, I think, because especially, I mean, it's not like we wouldn't work. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3371.36s)]
*  I mean, we worked really hard on this album. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3378.36s)]
*  I mean, pretty much since tour was over, I've been writing and, you know, just recording all that. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3381.36s)]
*  So, I mean, we recorded 50 or 51 songs and cut 13 or 14. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3388.36s)]
*  Wow. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3395.36s)]
*  Really? [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3396.36s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3397.36s)]
*  So what happens to a lot, you just kind of decide this doesn't fit here right now? [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3398.36s)]
*  Yeah, some of the songs were songs that I wrote, some of them weren't. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3402.36s)]
*  So if I didn't write them, then they'll just, whatever happens to them, not up to me anymore. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3405.36s)]
*  And then if I did, you know, who knows, I might make a side project of something, [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3410.36s)]
*  if something that has nothing to do with my name, I've always kind of wanted to do that anyway. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3416.36s)]
*  You know, just kind of figure out a way to, it wouldn't be my voice. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3421.36s)]
*  I don't know how you would do that. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3426.36s)]
*  I'm sure there's all kinds of ways to go about it now, you know, these days. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3428.36s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3431.36s)]
*  But it would not be my name, not my voice, not be any kind of style of music that I normally do, [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3432.36s)]
*  you know, just to see what happens to it. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3436.36s)]
*  It might be like house music or something, you know. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3439.36s)]
*  That'd be pretty sick, dude. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3441.36s)]
*  Yeah, dude, if you had house music. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3443.36s)]
*  I mean, people would, if they saw my name on it, they would, I don't want it to have my name on it. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3445.36s)]
*  I want to just see what happens if it just gets put out into the world. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3450.36s)]
*  You know, maybe I'll like put it on a story or something of whoever it is, you know, Dream Jacker [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3453.36s)]
*  or whatever the team is, but whatever the name of the guy is. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3457.36s)]
*  Yeah, dude, wet Dream Jacker, that'd be mine. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3462.36s)]
*  Dream Jack in currently. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3466.36s)]
*  I mean, we were talking, me and my buddies were talking about this topic the other day, actually. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3470.36s)]
*  And I don't know, it might actually happen. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3476.36s)]
*  Putting out something secret, low key. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3478.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3479.36s)]
*  Creating something. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3480.36s)]
*  Yeah, well, I bet, because that's an interesting thing. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3481.36s)]
*  It's like, once you kind of have made a name in one space, it's kind of hard. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3482.36s)]
*  You can't, you know, you almost have, if you want to get a real test of what people think of something, [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3486.36s)]
*  you kind of have to secretly do it some other way. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3491.36s)]
*  Yeah, but it wouldn't even be similar to the type of music that I'm doing. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3494.36s)]
*  It would be nothing even close to what I'm doing now. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3498.36s)]
*  It would be like, I mean, I like house music a little bit. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3501.36s)]
*  So I'll listen to it working out or driving or stuff, you know, like melodic stuff. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3506.36s)]
*  Like that kind of stuff? [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3509.36s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3510.36s)]
*  But I feel like a lot of that stuff doesn't necessarily have a lot of words and stuff, you know. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3511.36s)]
*  So maybe what if I took a song of mine that didn't make my album, but it's got a story, it's got all these things, you know. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3518.36s)]
*  What if, what would people like that? I don't know. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3523.36s)]
*  Dude, I've thought this, I thought, started thinking about this about two years ago. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3525.36s)]
*  So they have like ED, you go to these nightclubs and stuff and they'll have like John Summit, [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3529.36s)]
*  these different kind of guys who are playing like house, like trance or whatever, whatever it is. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3533.36s)]
*  It's just people doing dope really late at night and just doing like this, you know, whatever that is. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3538.36s)]
*  I don't know the difference between all of those styles of music. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3542.36s)]
*  It's like, it's one style of music. I know there's sub genres and all that, but yeah. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3545.36s)]
*  Same. I don't have a clue. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3549.36s)]
*  But I'm always like, why don't they have a more like country or like, why is it always like if they had remixes of a lot of great country music, [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3551.36s)]
*  and you put it to that same type of shit, because a lot of people want to still go have that environment, [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3560.36s)]
*  but I don't, sometimes you get tired of that music, it just gets kind of old. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3565.36s)]
*  So if they had remixes of some dope country shit, I'm like, if they had two country DJs that came out, [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3568.36s)]
*  I feel like it would be so sick just doing remixes and shit. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3573.36s)]
*  It would be cool. I'm surprised they don't have that already. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3576.36s)]
*  Me too. Me and Kayla Pressley tried, thought about trying to do it, but then it was just like, you don't have a lot of time, you know? [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3578.36s)]
*  And that becomes something too, is like there's things you want to do and you just don't have enough time, you know? [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3583.36s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. And that's smart for you to realize that. I mean, it'll be like, well, I'm going to quit my job. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3587.36s)]
*  It pays all my bills and, you know, go be a Mason. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3592.36s)]
*  It's like, well, maybe don't do that. So yeah. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3596.36s)]

*  Before you go, man, you have some, you have some amazing artists are going to be on some of these tour dates with you. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3603.36s)]
*  Yeah, I do. Did you have to call them individually and ask them how'd that kind of go? [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3610.36s)]
*  Because some of these are idols really in the industry. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3614.36s)]

*  So that was pretty easy. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3625.36s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, that was, that was already mutual interest. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3626.36s)]
*  And that's something that's kind of been a conversation for a little bit longer than just, you know, this year. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3629.36s)]
*  So that one kind of just worked itself out between them and my, and my managers. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3633.36s)]
*  I'm good friends with Thomas Redd as well. So that one, they were all. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3638.36s)]

*  I'm not going to lie. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3649.36s)]
*  Yeah, I think you're right. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3651.36s)]
*  It just all kind of happened pretty naturally, but I mean, it's unbelievable to me. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3653.36s)]
*  You know, like I haven't really this, this page that's pulled up. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3657.36s)]

*  Oh, he'll eat fucking two beers, dude. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3715.36s)]
*  Yeah, he doesn't give a damn, dude. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3718.36s)]
*  He played offensive line for Bud Light for a couple of years. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3720.36s)]
*  I think there is nobody like him. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3723.36s)]
*  He's fucking he's definitely outlandish. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3727.36s)]
*  What are those things? [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3730.36s)]
*  Those military? [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3731.36s)]
*  What are those M.R.E.s or whatever? [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3732.36s)]
*  He's got beer in there. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3734.36s)]
*  But he he's he's entertaining. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3740.36s)]
*  He's got he's got a good voice, too. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3743.36s)]
*  And his music seems like he just keeps getting better, too. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3745.36s)]
*  So I'm I'm happy for him. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3748.36s)]
*  I got to tap in more than my song play with a kid rocking them on his one of his shows last year. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3750.36s)]
*  Dude, I'll say this. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3755.36s)]
*  Bob Richie, his live performance, dude. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3756.36s)]
*  No, he'll he'll let him have it. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3759.36s)]
*  I mean, I know, you know, but I didn't hear it was good. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3761.36s)]
*  I've never seen it personally like firsthand, but it was really I can imagine. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3766.36s)]
*  I mean, I knew it would be. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3770.36s)]
*  It's just been some time. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3771.36s)]
*  You know, it's hard to keep up, you know, I mean, being out there for two hours, I mean, you guys get I mean, it's a lot, man. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3772.36s)]
*  It is, man. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3779.36s)]
*  It can be for sure. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3780.36s)]
*  I mean, depends on how often you do it, too. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3781.36s)]
*  You know, I mean, if you're doing it, some people, I guess, still do it three three nights a week. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3784.36s)]
*  I'm just I'm just going to do it, too, because it feels like a disservice to to me and everyone else to do it three days in a row. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3790.36s)]
*  You know, but to to seems like a good sweet spot. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3796.36s)]
*  You can as long, you know, you play the show, probably don't go to bed till three, four in the morning just because you're so wound up. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3799.36s)]
*  Yeah, you're up. People visit and you got to say bye to everybody. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3807.36s)]
*  All that shit. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3809.36s)]
*  Well, I don't do all that anymore. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3810.36s)]
*  But your family's here. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3812.36s)]
*  Yeah, but even still, they know what the priorities are at this point. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3813.36s)]
*  So if I if I play a show, you'll head out with my boy, if my boy is with me, he'll be asleep already anyway. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3816.36s)]
*  So I'll just we head straight out. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3821.36s)]
*  Don't stick around. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3824.36s)]
*  I try to go to bed as soon as possible. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3825.36s)]
*  Usually, like I said, don't have no three or four. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3827.36s)]
*  Then you try your best to sleep till noon, one, two, as late as you possibly can, just because your voice after doing all that, you know, you need all that rest. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3829.36s)]
*  So it's a it's become a little bit more like a regiment for me, which is which is good. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3838.36s)]
*  You know, I got a vocal coach and all that stuff too now. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3843.36s)]
*  So it's just like it's like a whole boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3846.36s)]
*  This is how it is now, you know, and that seems to help me a lot. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3849.36s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3852.36s)]
*  It's kind of interesting when I was a little younger, I could do those. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3853.36s)]
*  I could do, you know, some of the stretches. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3856.36s)]
*  And now I'm like, I don't wish I when I do see him on the schedule, it's a little bit tougher not comparing comedy and what, you know, no, but you're I mean, it is. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3858.36s)]
*  I mean, it's still the same thing. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3866.36s)]
*  It's like a regiment. It's like, yeah, I got to sleep in late. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3867.36s)]
*  It's like, well, that kind of sucks because now it's like kind of hard if you wake up at 10 to go back to sleep for two more hours, it's just it's light out. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3869.36s)]
*  It's really hard. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3874.36s)]
*  It's hard. But you know, you need that two hours of sleep. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3875.36s)]
*  Otherwise, I'm going to be edgy, you know, and I won't be able to man. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3877.36s)]
*  I might not want to go work out just all the little things like. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3880.36s)]
*  Yeah, it is. It's important because it's just about getting yourself back on the stage for that next that when it's time to go, it's time to go. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3883.36s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, back in the day, I mean, which we weren't playing two hour shows back then either, you know, but we would play six, six shows in one week. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3890.36s)]
*  So I don't know how I mean, it just had to be young, I guess, you know, I mean, it wasn't like we were. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3896.36s)]
*  I want no. The only regiment then was sleep till four, start drinking at five. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3902.36s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like, that's what it was then. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3907.36s)]
*  And we're going to be good. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3909.36s)]
*  Is that right? [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3911.36s)]
*  Bro, hell yeah. That's a Gavin Adcock national anthem. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3913.36s)]
*  Yeah, I think if I think back in the day, if I had a camera on me like like adcock does now, they might they might be they would be probably saying some similar things. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3916.36s)]
*  He's a little more. He's a little more bold with it, I guess than I was. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3925.36s)]
*  Well, he's really. Yeah, he's. Oh, dude, he's fucking on stage people. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3929.36s)]
*  I think there's some he's like people are throwing fucking beers. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3933.36s)]
*  He just has beers bouncing off of him. He's an animal, dude. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3936.36s)]
*  You're like the PA system shut down, but we're going to still fucking perform. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3940.36s)]
*  He just yell. He just he'll hollow out a beer can and just yell out of it and shit. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3944.36s)]
*  He is ballsy dude. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3948.36s)]
*  His personality is cool. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3951.36s)]
*  He's fun guy. Very entertaining. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3953.36s)]
*  I got to tap into more of his music. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3955.36s)]
*  I haven't listened to a lot of it. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3956.36s)]
*  Yeah, you need to get him on here. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3957.36s)]
*  Yeah, I do need to. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3958.36s)]
*  People say that would look alike a little bit, but I think they're just being nice to me. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3960.36s)]
*  To you, to you or him. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3965.36s)]

*  I like it on ice better. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3980.36s)]
*  Yeah, but I've always liked sweet tea better on ice. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3983.36s)]
*  I mean, you know, because I've been I'm trying to eat and live and drink and all that stuff clean. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3986.36s)]
*  So for something that's actually, you know, healthy, it's it's good. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3991.36s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, it's good for sure. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3995.36s)]
*  I like it. I like having a nice little beer. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=3997.36s)]
*  I'll keep a couple in the car. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=4000.36s)]
*  I'll drink a warm even. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=4001.36s)]
*  Do you? [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=4002.36s)]
*  Yeah, I'll get a whole one in me at a stoplight. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=4003.36s)]
*  Yeah, I don't do all that. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=4005.36s)]
*  You don't know my my drummer told me one time he had drink like I can't remember how many, you know, like 13 or something. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=4006.36s)]
*  And ungodly in a short amount of time said, damn, man, you're going to have kidney stones for sure. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=4013.36s)]
*  Well, maybe he'll have a band, a cover band. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=4020.36s)]
*  Of the Rolling Stones, it's called Kidney Stones. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=4025.36s)]
*  Kidney Stones. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=4028.36s)]
*  Is there a song sometimes of your own that you'll listen to or one that catches you sometimes it'll kind of catch in your feels a little bit? [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=4029.36s)]
*  Is there any one that you're like? [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=4037.36s)]
*  I mean, yeah, the song song I wrote to my son is the song. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=4039.36s)]
*  Oh, the one that's not out yet. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=4042.36s)]
*  Yeah, that does that. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=4043.36s)]
*  It'll be out soon. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=4044.36s)]
*  But I mean, it's also one of those things to where you know, you know, you're going to be able to get a little bit of a feel for it. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=4045.36s)]
*  It's also one of those things to where, you know, I've tried so many times to write a song like that for him and it always fell flat. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=4052.36s)]
*  So I'd listen to it on the way home or whatever after we wrote it and I'd be like, that's that's good. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=4059.36s)]
*  You know, but it's not it's not how I want it. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=4065.36s)]
*  And I also didn't want to write like a song to him that was all I don't know, sappy and slow. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=4068.36s)]
*  You know, just like what you would expect a dad's son song to be, you know, I wish you wouldn't grow up, you know, all that. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=4079.36s)]
*  Like I didn't want it to be that I wanted a birthday cake. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=4086.36s)]
*  It's like I didn't want that song at all. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=4091.36s)]
*  That song has been written plenty enough. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=4093.36s)]
*  So and I wanted it to keep like have a little bit of my my sound and my swag and just like and to be honest, you know, so it was a hard thing to try to get all those things wrapped up into one song. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=4095.36s)]
*  And it's called Superman's what it's called. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=4108.36s)]
*  And I feel like we accomplished that. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=4110.36s)]
*  And when I was when we wrote it and I was riding home, it was actually the last song that made my record. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=4112.36s)]
*  So it's not like I've had it for a long time. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=4116.36s)]
*  You know, it took us a while to to get that song. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=4118.36s)]
*  And it was actually Blake, one of my buddy Blake's. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=4122.36s)]
*  It was his idea. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=4126.36s)]
*  And the hook was different, though. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=4128.36s)]
*  It said Superman. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=4130.36s)]
*  I don't remember what the hook was exactly, but I was just singing it. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=4132.36s)]
*  And I was like, oh, I know. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=4135.36s)]
*  I know what it is. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=4137.36s)]
*  And I changed. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=4138.36s)]
*  I changed the hook and it like it made it. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=4139.36s)]
*  It was like, oh, there it is. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=4141.36s)]
*  Unlocked. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=4142.36s)]
*  And we all three of us there are four of us in the room just kind of I was like, oh, yeah, that's it. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=4143.36s)]
*  You know, and then on the way home, I was listening to it and started crying. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=4147.36s)]
*  And that's the first time I had that happen with a song for him. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=4150.36s)]
*  So that's I kind of knew. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=4155.36s)]
*  Yeah, that's cool, man. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHNhzChFZI&t=4157.36s)]
