*  Do a lot of Indian people, is that, you know, some places in America are certain like kind [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=117.03999999999999s)]
*  of spots where people start to come. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=121.0s)]
*  Is that a popular place that a lot of Indian people have gone to over the years? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=122.52s)]
*  You know, where I grew up in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, there were a few Indian families, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=126.08s)]
*  but it was 99% white. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=129.2s)]

*  Edison has got a lot of Indian food. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=137.28s)]
*  Have you eaten Indian food? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=139.24s)]
*  Oh yeah, I've had some good Indian food. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=140.24s)]
*  What's your favorite dish? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=141.24s)]
*  I think it's like the one, it's like where you all sit in a circle and everybody kind [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=143.07999999999998s)]
*  of like catches a cold together or whatever. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=147.18s)]
*  Catches a cold. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=149.24s)]
*  I just mean like everybody's like kind of sharing off of this. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=152.04000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, it is a very sure thing. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=154.44s)]

*  That's the best Indian food in the country. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=158.52s)]
*  But Fremont, Silicon Valley, a lot of Indian families, New York, New Jersey. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=161.0s)]
*  You know, but my upbringing was interesting because I was one of the few Indian kids growing [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=165.08s)]
*  up in Pennsylvania. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=170.0s)]
*  And you know, I grew up though with a lot of people who, teachers who believed in me, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=173.04000000000002s)]
*  little league coaches who believed in me. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=178.68s)]
*  And at times I would get teased being Indian. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=180.68s)]
*  But by and large, it made me very hopeful about the country. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=182.96s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=186.56s)]
*  Well, thanks. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=187.56s)]
*  I know we wanted to talk about, I'm trying to think, I actually wrote some questions [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=188.56s)]
*  down today because I feel like it's important. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=192.02s)]
*  This is like meet the press. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=195.12s)]
*  You got, you're on a different level. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=196.44s)]
*  I thought, you know, the thing I love about your show is it's kind of just you talking [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=199.92000000000002s)]
*  like a regular person. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=204.44s)]
*  Maybe you're right. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=205.44s)]
*  Should I put these away, you think? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=206.44s)]
*  I mean, no, you can give it a try. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=207.92s)]
*  I mean, I think you know why? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=209.64s)]
*  I think this is what I realized. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=211.44s)]
*  I was like, man, I have, sometimes I have conversations with people that I want to be [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=212.44s)]
*  able to get more information from and I can't remember everything. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=216.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=221.64s)]
*  But you know what the thing about you is, I'm not saying this to flatter you. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=222.64s)]
*  A lot of times you'll ask questions and they're like deeper and smarter than some of the Sunday [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=224.96s)]
*  talk show hosts. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=230.2s)]
*  And I think it's because you actually talk to real people and it's sort of like, well, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=231.2s)]
*  how does this affect my buddy? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=234.6s)]
*  How does this affect real people? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=236.08s)]
*  So you could give it a try with the. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=237.76000000000002s)]
*  Well, we'll do a mix. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=239.36s)]
*  How about this? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=240.36s)]
*  We, I know how we got in touch is you and I have like similar thoughts on different [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=241.36s)]
*  topics online. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=245.72000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=246.72000000000003s)]
*  Well, let's just start with Iran or Iran. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=247.72000000000003s)]
*  People say it differently, but do you think we're headed into World War Three here? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=250.20000000000002s)]
*  What do you think is going on? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=253.0s)]
*  I'm really concerned. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=254.36s)]
*  I'm fearful. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=255.96s)]
*  We have a possibility where we're going to blunder into another war in the Middle East. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=258.44s)]
*  And just today, actually, to make some news, Thomas Massey, who's a principled Republican [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=265.32s)]
*  and myself introduced a war powers resolution saying that the president should not get into [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=270.48s)]
*  a war with Iran without coming to Congress. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=277.15999999999997s)]
*  You know, the president to his credit ran against the war in Iraq. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=281.76s)]
*  He ran saying I don't want any wars. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=284.84s)]
*  And the reality is that if we strike Iran, they start hitting us back and hitting our [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=288.68s)]
*  troops in the Middle East, terrorist activity. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=294.24s)]
*  That's going to cost this country a lot of money that should be being spent here at home. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=297.47999999999996s)]
*  It's going to mean people could die who are serving the country. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=302.08s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=305.24s)]
*  Well, let's look at this by the bill you guys were thinking about. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=306.24s)]
*  What is it called? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=308.8s)]
*  It's called the War Powers Resolution to Stop a War in Iran, which basically says before [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=309.8s)]
*  the president does anything to go into war with Iran, he's got to get a vote in Congress. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=314.71999999999997s)]
*  And how long does that take though? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=320.32s)]
*  Like usually to get a vote in Congress? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=321.88s)]
*  Is there a certain period of time? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=323.44s)]
*  Can they do it in 24 hours? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=324.44s)]
*  It takes weeks or what? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=325.47999999999996s)]
*  They could. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=326.47999999999996s)]
*  It's the decision of the speaker of the house when he can bring it. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=327.47999999999996s)]
*  He has to bring it within 15 days. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=329.4s)]
*  But what we want is today. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=331.79999999999995s)]
*  But by the way, you know, there are a lot of Trump supporters who are telling him don't [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=333.79999999999995s)]
*  go into this war. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=337.47999999999996s)]
*  Tucker Carlson, Marjorie Taylor Greene. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=339.23999999999995s)]
*  Oh, Dave Smith was talking about it. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=342.23999999999995s)]
*  He's a political, he's a comedian who also talks a lot about politics, you know. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=344.03999999999996s)]
*  Oh, I think this is a horrible idea. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=347.88s)]
*  You know, and yeah, people say, well, you don't know a ton about the Middle East. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=350.8s)]
*  Well, like, that's fine. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=353.12s)]
*  I don't want people I know, my friends getting called up. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=354.12s)]
*  I don't want the children of my friends getting called over to die. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=358.92s)]
*  I don't even understand how it's an option. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=364.0s)]
*  The only reason I even kind of want it to be possible is to give is that if Israel goes [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=366.64s)]
*  to war with Iran, then it'll at least stop killing Palestinian people for a day or two. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=373.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=378.96s)]
*  It's like, at least point the guns that way, you know, kind of that's where some of my [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=380.91999999999996s)]
*  thoughts are. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=384.32s)]
*  Look, you've been such a courageous voice on Gaza. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=385.32s)]
*  I mean, you look at what's going on there, right? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=388.84s)]
*  55,000 people killed. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=392.24s)]
*  Now Israel says some terrorists and they're right, some terrorists, but most of them women [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=395.2s)]
*  and children. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=399.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=400.76s)]
*  You've got 130,000 people injured. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=401.76s)]
*  You've got over 600,000 kids who are not in school there. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=404.47999999999996s)]
*  You've got the entire population of Gaza being forced into a corner, southern corner [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=409.22s)]
*  of Gaza. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=415.70000000000005s)]
*  And then you've got over 400,000 people who are starving, who don't have enough food to [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=417.34000000000003s)]
*  live a decent life. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=424.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=426.26000000000005s)]
*  And the saddest part I feel like is you see this and you're like, somebody should come [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=427.26000000000005s)]
*  help them. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=430.42s)]
*  That's my first thought a lot of times. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=431.42s)]
*  And then the saddest thought for me after that is we should come out. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=433.18s)]
*  It feels like America is the group that would go to help that situation usually. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=437.38s)]
*  That's we're the good guys, right? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=443.09999999999997s)]
*  I mean, we were the good guys in World War II. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=444.09999999999997s)]
*  We saved the world from Nazism. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=446.9s)]
*  We were the good guys in the Cold War. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=448.52s)]
*  We stood up the Soviet Union. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=451.09999999999997s)]
*  People want to think that we are the good guys. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=453.21999999999997s)]
*  Why are we helping Netanyahu in the killing of children, women, and so many Palestinian [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=455.9s)]
*  civilians? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=465.73999999999995s)]
*  Israel was hard hit October 7th. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=466.74s)]
*  I'm sure like many people, you thought that was horrific, the October 7th attack. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=469.54s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=475.5s)]
*  And neither of us have any sympathy for Hamas. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=476.5s)]
*  They're a terrorist group. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=480.14s)]
*  But what happened is I supported initially Israel saying go get those terrorists who [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=481.94s)]
*  committed those horrific attacks on October 7th. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=486.7s)]
*  But by within three months, they had destroyed a lot of Hamas. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=489.86s)]
*  What now is happening over two years later, they're still going and bombing. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=495.7s)]
*  And they're bombing because Ben-Gavir and Smotlich, two of the people in Netanyahu's [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=501.34s)]
*  cabinet are saying don't stop the war, even though they know that you can't bomb and [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=507.38s)]
*  eradicate Hamas. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=512.62s)]
*  They haven't been able to do it. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=514.28s)]
*  And the only thing that's happening is that civilians are getting killed and Israel actually [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=516.42s)]
*  is becoming less popular in that region. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=523.12s)]
*  I mean, I was in Saudi Arabia and Jordan. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=526.04s)]
*  They're losing support. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=528.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=530.4s)]
*  So why is Netanyahu trying to drag us into it? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=531.4s)]
*  What do you think that relationship is like between him and Donald Trump? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=534.36s)]
*  So I think Donald Trump actually initially stood up to Netanyahu because he wanted to [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=538.16s)]
*  bring this war to a close and he didn't want to get dragged in initially to a war in Iran. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=543.04s)]
*  I mean, you know what Trump's courage was while he became president in 2016? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=548.76s)]
*  Do you remember the Republican stage and they all asked, are you for the Iraq war? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=553.28s)]
*  And Jeb Bush, who was George Bush's brother, wasn't willing to say that his brother made [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=558.12s)]
*  a mistake. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=562.1999999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah, he's a little oil bunny. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=563.1999999999999s)]
*  And Donald Trump, to his credit, stood up on a Republican stage and said the Iraq war [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=565.12s)]
*  was a disaster. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=570.4799999999999s)]
*  I think that's how he became president. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=571.9399999999999s)]
*  And he ran saying, I want to be a president who ends these wars. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=573.78s)]
*  I really believe that's what he thought at the time. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=577.5799999999999s)]
*  Oh, well, sure. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=581.4599999999999s)]
*  Well, I think recently, you know, how are we doing okay without the notes so far? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=582.4599999999999s)]
*  You're doing great. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=586.6999999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=587.6999999999999s)]
*  I wish people had more common sense like you than the people who are making this foreign [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=588.6999999999999s)]
*  policy stuff. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=592.86s)]
*  Actually, my recommendation is that before Donald Trump makes a decision, he needs to [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=593.86s)]
*  have a conversation with you. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=597.62s)]
*  Oh, God. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=598.9399999999999s)]
*  No, well, to remind him, because I watched your actually clip with him during the presidential [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=599.9399999999999s)]
*  campaign, and I said you made him the most human that I've actually seen him. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=605.06s)]
*  I mean, you're a conversation with him about his brother and alcoholism. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=610.34s)]
*  And then he asks you, what is it? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=614.54s)]
*  What was it like for you to have cocaine and your addiction? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=616.42s)]
*  And I thought, well, this is like him having a normal conversation. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=618.9399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it felt pretty normal. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=622.1s)]
*  And so, you know, but I think, do you know anyone, Theo, in your life who's like, yeah, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=623.3s)]
*  we should go out and go to war with Iran? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=628.66s)]
*  Like any of the folks you talk to? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=630.9s)]
*  Nobody. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=632.46s)]
*  Even like even like hardhead, you know, like even guys who like Navy, former Navy, no, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=633.62s)]
*  none of them. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=641.14s)]
*  Nobody is saying yes. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=642.14s)]
*  And I felt like the biggest thing that's I mean, there's so many things right now. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=643.7s)]
*  And it's like that I feel like in the world that are kind of stressing people and making [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=648.82s)]
*  people nervous. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=653.86s)]
*  But one of the things is I felt like it was supposed to be America first. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=655.4000000000001s)]
*  Like we're focusing on like, what are we doing to get things back into America? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=657.9000000000001s)]
*  To like increase like the purpose of being an American, to refill like our hearts with [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=661.94s)]
*  blood and like and and and make us feel something again here and make us be excited about being [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=668.1s)]
*  an American. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=674.1800000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=675.1800000000001s)]
*  And I felt like that was what a lot of the energy was for. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=676.1800000000001s)]
*  And then now that we're caught up here and it feels like we are just working for Israel. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=679.74s)]
*  I think to a lot of people, it's I don't know. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=686.0600000000001s)]
*  You just really start to feel very disillusioned pretty quickly. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=689.62s)]
*  And I don't mean disillusioned in people. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=694.46s)]
*  I don't mean disillusioned in like the human beings, but this disillusioned in our leaders. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=695.9000000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=701.34s)]
*  You start to feel like, I don't know, at one point, neither one of these parties is helping [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=702.34s)]
*  us. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=706.82s)]
*  Well, they both seem like parties that have gotten us into war. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=707.82s)]
*  I mean, six trillion dollars had cost us into Iraq and Afghanistan. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=711.22s)]
*  We need now an anti-war movement in this country. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=716.38s)]
*  And I don't think it has to be Democrat or Republican. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=720.0600000000001s)]
*  I think Americans are sick of war. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=722.4200000000001s)]
*  Here are the two things I think we could do. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=725.6600000000001s)]
*  Look on how do you end the war in Gaza? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=727.38s)]
*  Yeah, that's a great question. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=731.02s)]
*  How do you know what would you do to curtail things right now in Gaza? [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=732.4200000000001s)]
*  Do you think they're really going to aim for like a two party state over there? [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=735.82s)]
*  To me, it looks like they're just going to try to sweep these people into the ocean. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=738.86s)]
*  You know, I hate to say that. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=743.38s)]
*  The problem is you've got Netanyahu who is listening to his right wing, right? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=745.5s)]
*  Ben Gavir and Smotlich. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=750.26s)]
*  These are two guys. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=753.02s)]
*  Smokless is the other guy's name? [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=754.02s)]
*  Smotlich. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=755.02s)]
*  Smotlich. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=756.02s)]
*  Smotlich, bring him up. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=757.02s)]
*  There he is. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=758.02s)]
*  Smotrich. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=759.02s)]
*  Mazzalo Smotlich. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=760.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=761.02s)]
*  And these guys are basically telling, they're telling Netanyahu that if you stop bombing [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=762.02s)]
*  Gaza until all of Hamas is killed, that we won't support you for prime minister. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=768.94s)]
*  So Netanyahu stops, he stops being prime minister. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=775.9000000000001s)]
*  I see what you're saying. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=779.5400000000001s)]
*  So he's in a bit of a catch-22. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=780.5400000000001s)]
*  He's in a catch-22. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=781.5400000000001s)]
*  But why do I don't understand if they're, because you always hear great things about [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=783.58s)]
*  the Israeli military, right? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=786.5400000000001s)]
*  The IDF, you always hear like how amazing they are. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=788.5400000000001s)]
*  And I've met a lot of former people that have been in it and guys who were like in the Krav Maga, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=791.34s)]
*  some really talented warriors really. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=796.14s)]
*  But then why not send like your Navy SEALs to get the actual Hamas people? [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=800.1s)]
*  I don't understand this. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=804.54s)]
*  If you're so precise, then what is this, you're bug spraying this group, these people, you [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=806.1s)]
*  know, like. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=812.66s)]
*  They got them in the first three months. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=813.9s)]
*  They destroyed most of Hamas's military capability. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=816.1s)]
*  But the reality is, Hamas is both a military movement, but it's also partly a political [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=819.38s)]
*  movement. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=826.02s)]
*  I mean, there are people. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=827.02s)]
*  Some people in Palestine elected Hamas because they thought they needed a desperate political [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=828.02s)]
*  party. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=831.98s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=832.98s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=833.98s)]
*  So then the question is, well, what do you do? [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=834.98s)]
*  Because I agree with you that Hamas can't be governing Gaza. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=835.98s)]
*  And so there is a solution. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=839.18s)]
*  And the solution is the president, Donald Trump, can call Netanyahu and say, OK, enough [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=841.12s)]
*  with the bombing. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=845.02s)]
*  You know, we're giving them right now 2000 pound bombs to hit these civilians. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=846.02s)]
*  We're giving them. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=852.18s)]
*  There's a video the other day. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=853.18s)]
*  Sorry to interrupt you, bro. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=854.18s)]
*  Can you see if you can pull it up, Trevor? [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=855.7399999999999s)]
*  There's a video of a child picking up the casing of a missile and and reading it. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=857.14s)]
*  I think see if you find that. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=865.14s)]
*  Maybe we can't find it. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=869.02s)]
*  That's OK. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=869.8599999999999s)]
*  Do you think there's any chance of Palestine getting its land back there? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=872.06s)]
*  I do. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=876.14s)]
*  But first of all, you talked about this child getting a missile. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=877.3399999999999s)]
*  I mean, how would it make you feel that our tax dollars actually were paying for a lot [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=880.5s)]
*  of the missiles and the weapons that are being used to now kill Palestinians? [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=885.98s)]
*  I agree. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=891.5400000000001s)]
*  I think we've given them $12 billion this year. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=892.5400000000001s)]
*  Israel allegedly. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=895.22s)]
*  Can you look up what amount of war materials that we've given them, Trevin? [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=896.22s)]
*  United States provided significant military at Israel throughout 2025. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=901.74s)]
*  The Trump administration, which took office in January 2025, has approved nearly $12 billion [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=909.18s)]
*  in major foreign military sales to Israel. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=914.14s)]
*  This includes nearly a $3 billion arms sale. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=917.9s)]
*  Does that mean we're selling them to them? [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=920.26s)]
*  We're selling part of them to them. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=922.0999999999999s)]
*  And then we've also given aid. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=924.02s)]
*  Now, I voted against the offensive weapons aid about last year, but we approved it. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=925.2199999999999s)]
*  So some of it is an aid. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=930.9s)]
*  Some of it is in sales. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=932.8599999999999s)]
*  Trump is giving them 2000 pound bombs that they can be using. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=935.18s)]
*  So here's, though, what I think that I'm hoping he or others may be listening to this, because [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=939.3399999999999s)]
*  your voice really matters, because you know, and a lot of people have voted for him and [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=944.78s)]
*  they voted for him because they wanted American patriotism. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=948.3399999999999s)]
*  They wanted to focus on building our industrial base. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=951.38s)]
*  They wanted us out of these wars. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=954.26s)]
*  Donald Trump can call Netanyahu and he says, enough, we're not going to be giving you more [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=956.26s)]
*  offensive weapons to kill more civilians in Gaza. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=961.5s)]
*  But here's what I'm going to do. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=965.38s)]
*  I'm going to convene Saudi Arabia. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=966.9799999999999s)]
*  I'm going to convene Jordan. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=970.3s)]
*  What does convene mean? [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=971.3s)]
*  I'm going to convene and bring them together. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=972.3s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=974.3s)]
*  Bring them together. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=975.3s)]
*  We're going to get the Arab states together. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=976.5s)]
*  Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, people in Palestine, Fatah, Israel, the United States. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=979.4599999999999s)]
*  And we're going to say we need a new government in Gaza. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=986.3399999999999s)]
*  It can't be Hamas. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=988.86s)]
*  Hamas is a terrorist organization. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=990.62s)]
*  We're going to get rid of Hamas. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=993.38s)]
*  And we're going to make sure that this new government has Palestinian voices, but also [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=995.42s)]
*  has Saudi, Jordan, Egypt, part of it to make it secure so that they don't attack Israel. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=999.9s)]
*  Because Saudi doesn't want to attack Israel. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1007.1800000000001s)]
*  He could win the Nobel Prize. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1010.02s)]
*  He wants to always win the Nobel Prize. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1011.98s)]
*  Who, Donald Trump? [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1012.98s)]
*  Donald Trump could win the Nobel Prize. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1013.98s)]
*  How could he win it, do you think, right? [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1014.98s)]
*  I think if he comes in and he says to Netanyahu, stop, stop this, I'm actually the president [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1016.1s)]
*  who's going to bring peace. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1021.74s)]
*  And here's how we're going to do it. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1023.1s)]
*  It's not just going to be Israel, the United States, and Palestine, because we agree Hamas [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1024.9s)]
*  can't be anywhere running Gaza. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1028.82s)]
*  I mean, Hamas has called for the destruction of Israel. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1031.02s)]
*  We have to stand for Israel's right to exist as a Jewish democratic state. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1033.78s)]
*  I mean, that is a principle we have to respect. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1037.82s)]
*  But we're going to get Saudi Arabia. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1041.54s)]
*  And they have to respect Palestine's right to exist. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1043.18s)]
*  They have to respect Palestine's right to self-determination and have a Palestinian [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1046.74s)]
*  state in Gaza and in the West Bank. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1050.4199999999998s)]
*  And you can get those two states. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1052.8999999999999s)]
*  And with land swaps, you could actually make it that even a lot of the settlers are still [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1055.26s)]
*  going to be able to stay in some of the places. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1061.1s)]
*  I mean, you could get to a lot of the deal we know that needs to happen. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1063.82s)]
*  But Trump has a good relationship with the Saudis. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1067.8999999999999s)]
*  We have a good relationship with Jordan. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1071.1799999999998s)]
*  We've got a good relationship with Egypt. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1073.26s)]
*  We've got all of these countries on board and say, OK, what is the new Palestinian [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1075.46s)]
*  leadership going to look like? [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1079.78s)]
*  Saudi, Egypt, Jordan, are you going to guarantee? [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1081.22s)]
*  Qatar too. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1083.42s)]
*  Qatar. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1084.18s)]
*  My boys over there. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1084.7s)]
*  You got, you know. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1085.66s)]
*  I was just over there, man. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1086.3400000000001s)]
*  They had us all dressed up like a bunch of Ku Klux Sans. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1087.54s)]
*  You were in Qatar? [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1089.8600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1090.6200000000001s)]
*  What were you doing in Qatar? [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1091.02s)]
*  They had me come and perform for the troops. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1092.18s)]
*  Wow. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1093.94s)]
*  It was really great. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1094.7s)]
*  It was pretty special. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1095.42s)]
*  But sorry, I interrupted you just to get a joke in. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1096.74s)]
*  But I also was excited and had a great time there. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1098.74s)]
*  They really treated me very nice. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1101.9s)]
*  People thought I was a spy. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1103.18s)]
*  I thought maybe they were going to. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1104.22s)]
*  You can be part of this whole Middle East plan. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1105.42s)]
*  Maybe you'll go perform if they get if they get it, if they get a if they get a state [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1107.02s)]
*  there. I mean, I look, what bothers me is we know what we need to do. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1111.54s)]
*  Right. So why is Trump afraid? [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1115.66s)]
*  Is Trump is Donald Trump afraid of Netanyahu? [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1117.5s)]
*  I don't understand that, you know, because Trump certainly feels like he's seen he is [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1119.38s)]
*  a guy who does not seem afraid to say what he wants to say. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1124.22s)]
*  I don't think I don't know what it is because I want Trump to do the right thing. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1128.46s)]
*  Like I want him to start to end the war in Gaza to actually figure out how we get peace [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1133.38s)]
*  there. And I think he could he could if he picks up the phone and he says, Netanyahu, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1140.5800000000002s)]
*  you're done. Netanyahu is going to stop the bombing. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1144.98s)]
*  And then Netanyahu is going to say, OK, but we got Hamas. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1147.7s)]
*  I can't stay here with Hamas. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1150.1000000000001s)]
*  And Trump can say, OK, I'm going to help you get rid of Hamas. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1151.66s)]
*  But you can't keep bombing and killing women and children. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1155.3400000000001s)]
*  That's not getting rid of Hamas. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1157.74s)]
*  Yeah, it's freaking crazy, dude. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1159.0600000000002s)]
*  I mean, it's just like. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1160.8200000000002s)]
*  And so you get Egypt, you get Jordan, you get Saudi Arabia. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1162.5s)]
*  I call it the twenty three state solution. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1165.18s)]
*  You get all of those Arab. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1167.54s)]
*  But Mississippi, dude, I'll tell you this. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1168.7s)]
*  We can get Mississippi to Palestine. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1171.5s)]
*  I've been saying that for 15 years. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1173.22s)]

*  could use an economic boom. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1187.74s)]
*  You know, they could use, I think, some [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1190.06s)]
*  for Palestinian immigrants coming, maybe. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1192.58s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I'm saying with Palestinian immigrants coming, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1194.62s)]
*  it would just kind of like add a new texture to that whole state. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1198.22s)]
*  I think it needs like a rebirth of of thought. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1200.78s)]
*  You know, they have a lot of great arts there, but I think they had Faulkner. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1204.1s)]

*  I mean, those are easy when some of them. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1214.86s)]
*  But but no, I'm just saying if they had the Palestinians there, it'd be interesting. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1216.22s)]
*  So I've just always thought that that would be interesting. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1219.26s)]

*  And I'm reading this. Just give me a break, guys. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1586.1s)]
*  Real quick. We are at a point, I believe, [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1588.5800000000002s)]
*  where a lot of people are starting to see that neither party really represents [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1590.5s)]
*  the people. That's the that's the feeling that I'm hearing people say. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1594.1000000000001s)]
*  I've heard Candace Owens say it. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1598.5s)]
*  And, you know, she's, you know, very much been a kind of Republican role model, [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1599.7800000000002s)]
*  I feel like, or at least have some influence of that. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1603.66s)]
*  I feel like she's also kind of in a lane of her own. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1606.94s)]
*  Parties have been unable to keep businesses and lobbyists away from politics. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1610.14s)]
*  In 2025, lobbying was at an all time high of four point four billion. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1613.6999999999998s)]
*  I believe that's a couple of sites said that online, the sites could be lying. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1618.3s)]
*  How can we know who is accepting lobby money? [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1623.4199999999998s)]
*  First of all, how do we know that? Yeah. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1626.74s)]
*  So first of all, take a guess how many lobbyists there are in Washington right now. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1629.5s)]
*  Ballpark. 12000. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1634.1s)]
*  Yeah. Ten thousand. That's pretty good. Ten thousand. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1636.98s)]
*  They're hiding a couple thousand. You know it. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1639.9399999999998s)]
*  Ten thousand think they're five hundred members of Congress. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1642.78s)]
*  That's that five thirty five right. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1644.9s)]
*  Members of Congress senators. That's 20 to one. Right. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1647.1s)]
*  You play football like imagine you got 20 people, your wide receiver. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1649.1s)]
*  You got 20 people covering you. Yeah. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1652.46s)]
*  Now, let me give you a concrete example of how this stuff works. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1654.5s)]
*  Pharma lobbyists, right. Just big pharma. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1658.6200000000001s)]
*  There are about 1200 big pharma lobbyists. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1661.22s)]
*  So it's about two and a half to one for every member of Congress. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1663.6200000000001s)]
*  I'm sure you know people who want to get some drug [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1668.18s)]
*  prescription drugs I'm talking about and it's too much money. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1672.26s)]
*  Right. And they skip it. Do you do you know, folks? [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1675.18s)]
*  Oh, yeah, totally. I do. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1677.3799999999999s)]
*  So Donald Trump, one of the good things he does is he puts out an executive order [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1678.9s)]
*  and he says Americans shouldn't pay more for any of these prescription [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1684.22s)]
*  drugs than people in other parts of the world. Right. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1688.46s)]
*  You know, I've had people who like go to a foreign country to get the drug [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1691.26s)]
*  because they don't want to pay them. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1694.98s)]
*  They can't afford to pay the drugs. Yeah. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1696.82s)]
*  One night I'm hanging out with a girl and, you know, we had we've been on a couple of dates. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1698.5s)]
*  I thought I was going to maybe smooch a little. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1701.78s)]
*  It's 11 p.m. She's like she's like, I have to drive to Mexico. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1704.1399999999999s)]
*  Are you serious? I'm not even joking. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1709.58s)]
*  She's like, I have to drive to Mexico to get Ozempic. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1711.98s)]
*  And she's like, if I leave now, the hours are best for driving there and back. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1714.26s)]
*  And I was like, oh, so the way to her heart was like getting her this drug. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1716.8999999999999s)]
*  I'm not riding with her, you know, but I definitely I gave her a little bit of gas money, [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1720.86s)]
*  you know, because I hope to see her again. But anyway, anyway, it's crazy. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1723.94s)]
*  Right. I mean, we're we're we're paying for all these drugs to be developed. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1728.1s)]
*  You and I pay the NIH to develop all these drugs. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1731.22s)]
*  Then the big pharma sells them at a profit to Americans. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1735.54s)]
*  And basically, the rest of the world gets these drugs at a fraction of the cost. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1740.6200000000001s)]
*  Right. So we're subsidizing their cost over there. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1744.26s)]
*  We're subsidizing their costs. Now, I want someone could say, OK, [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1746.34s)]
*  Mexico or some of these developing countries find you. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1748.98s)]
*  They should have these drugs cheaper. But we're subsidizing Great Britain. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1752.02s)]
*  We're subsidizing Japan. We're subsidizing Europe. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1755.94s)]
*  These are rich countries. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1758.62s)]
*  We're subsidizing Switzerland. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1759.78s)]
*  So Donald Trump, one thing that I agree with, he comes out and he says [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1761.3799999999999s)]
*  Americans shouldn't pay a higher price than any other industrialized country. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1764.9799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. I'm the first congressperson actually to introduce his executive order as a law. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1768.9399999999998s)]
*  I said, OK, because the executive order, you know, the pharma just will sue it [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1775.86s)]
*  and tie it up in court and nothing is going to happen. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1780.02s)]
*  Yeah, because he had another one with price transparency. Right. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1782.2199999999998s)]
*  Where it was like all the all the prices of of of if you go get an MRI, [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1785.1399999999999s)]
*  whatever it is, it needs to be like a menu like you go to McDonald's. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1790.66s)]
*  You know how much it costs. Right. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1792.98s)]
*  Because without a menu, they can just charge you later whatever they want. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1794.18s)]
*  Right. Which is part of the whole bait and switch to the insurance system [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1797.02s)]
*  as part of the whole shell game. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1800.1399999999999s)]
*  That was another executive order. But that hasn't been enacted. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1803.58s)]
*  Like, how do we get these things to actually happen? [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1807.18s)]
*  Like, why do they stop it at executive order? [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1811.1399999999999s)]
*  Because there's always this pomp and circumstance. Right. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1813.3s)]
*  It's an executive order, but it never gets followed through. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1815.34s)]
*  Because it gets tied up in courts and they get sued. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1818.5s)]
*  And they say, well, Congress didn't authorize it. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1822.34s)]
*  So I look, I actually give Trump some credit for putting it out there. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1824.34s)]
*  But he knows everyone knows it can't actually make a difference [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1828.3s)]
*  until it becomes a law. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1832.02s)]
*  And who sues it? The pharma company? The pharma company sue it. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1833.46s)]
*  They've got a whole industry of lawyers, of lobbyists. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1836.18s)]
*  And they come out and they sue them. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1840.8600000000001s)]
*  And by the way, they're making record profits. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1843.5s)]
*  And they say, oh, we need this money to do research and innovation. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1845.38s)]
*  Give me a break. They have those profits. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1849.8600000000001s)]
*  They're buying back their stock. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1852.5800000000002s)]
*  They're giving out dividends. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1854.42s)]
*  Their executives are making tons of money. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1856.06s)]
*  Oh, yeah. They're buying freaking Corvettes, dude. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1858.1000000000001s)]
*  They're doing it. But they are. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1860.78s)]
*  They're all probably all have Corvettes. And they don't care. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1862.1000000000001s)]
*  That's the thing. They don't care. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1864.74s)]
*  But so how do we stop that system? Right. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1865.78s)]
*  First of all, do you believe that system can actually be stopped? [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1869.18s)]
*  I do. I do. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1872.26s)]
*  And I'll give you two examples. Why? [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1874.5s)]
*  Because we did it with big tobacco. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1876.3000000000002s)]
*  You remember that when tobacco basically had Washington, D.C. bought. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1877.98s)]
*  And then there was a campaign that said free kids from tobacco. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1881.78s)]
*  And bring that up. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1886.02s)]
*  I want to see a picture that some kid would have smoked if they let them. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1887.0600000000002s)]
*  They used to. There it is. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1891.1000000000001s)]
*  Campaign for the campaign for tobacco, free kids, an American nonprofit [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1894.3400000000001s)]
*  membership organization established in 1995 with Bill Novelli as its first president. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1898.1s)]
*  OK, so that happened in 1995. And that had an effect. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1903.34s)]
*  Well, it was them. It was grassroots organizing. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1906.5s)]
*  There was a hearing in front of Congress. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1909.5s)]
*  They brought in all these tobacco executives. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1911.34s)]
*  And basically, the tobacco executives are seen lying to the American public saying, [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1914.34s)]
*  yeah, we know that this stuff is addictive. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1918.78s)]
*  And that had a huge impact. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1921.1799999999998s)]
*  There was laws that got passed that said, [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1922.8999999999999s)]
*  you can't sell tobacco cigarettes to kids. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1926.0600000000002s)]
*  You have to disclose the addictive quality. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1929.6200000000001s)]
*  So we stood up to a big tobacco. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1933.14s)]
*  We also did it one other time in this country famously. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1934.7800000000002s)]
*  I don't know if you know what D.T. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1937.6200000000001s)]
*  DDT is DDT. Yeah, definitely. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1938.7800000000002s)]
*  It's in the yard, brother. Yeah, they say it's in the grass, right? [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1941.42s)]
*  You know, it's the fertilizers. Yeah. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1944.14s)]
*  And there was this one Rachel Carson, she exposed that it was hurting your health. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1945.5800000000002s)]
*  It was hurting our the birds. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1949.3000000000002s)]
*  It was hurting the ecosystem. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1952.0600000000002s)]
*  And that led to Congress saying, no, we're going to ban DDT for a lot of different uses. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1953.62s)]
*  We got to do the same thing in standing up with Pharma. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1959.1799999999998s)]
*  How much money does Pharma spend? [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1961.5s)]
*  Three hundred and eighty million dollars a year in lobbying and lobbying [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1962.74s)]
*  or in commercials, you mean, in just in lobbying. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1967.5s)]
*  Now, does lobbying include commercials? [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1969.22s)]
*  That means that that's a congressman in reps. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1970.6599999999999s)]
*  That's paying to congresspeople and reps. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1973.26s)]
*  That's like money that is going to congressmen, to representatives, [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1974.9399999999998s)]
*  to state legislators. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1978.86s)]
*  So I introduced this bill, right, saying, OK, [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1980.1799999999998s)]
*  let's do what Donald Trump wants. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1983.06s)]
*  Let's do what Bernie Sanders wants. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1984.38s)]
*  Like, how can we disagree on this? [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1986.1s)]
*  Let's take it to Pharma so Americans don't pay more. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1987.82s)]
*  I get two Republicans who co-sponsor it, [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1990.66s)]
*  Representative Luna and Representative Biggs. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1993.14s)]
*  Bring them up. Bring up Luna and Biggs, first of all. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1996.18s)]
*  And if that's not a animated series, I don't even know. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=1999.34s)]
*  It sounds also like it could be a rap group, Luna and Biggs. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2003.74s)]
*  We got to shout them. So that's Andy Biggs. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2006.06s)]
*  He's a legitimate guy. He's a legitimate guy. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2007.78s)]
*  I mean, look, I disagree on things, but like he's willing [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2009.9s)]
*  to stand up for what he believes. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2012.94s)]
*  Representative Luna, she's willing to stand up. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2015.9s)]
*  Oh, dude, I was just looking at her online yesterday. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2019.06s)]
*  I like her. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2021.8600000000001s)]
*  I mean, she is. I like what she says. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2023.5800000000002s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? I like her energy. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2025.7s)]
*  She's she's she she has an independence. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2027.14s)]
*  And I got a few of the Democrats to be on board with this. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2029.74s)]
*  Obviously, they they don't want Americans being overcharged for prescription drugs. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2033.14s)]
*  I mean, this was part of Bernie's whole campaign. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2037.3s)]
*  And now people are are there also people telling you that they got on board [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2039.42s)]
*  or did it come down to a vote? How did it end up? [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2042.58s)]
*  So right now we don't even have a we don't have a vote. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2044.82s)]
*  We should have every single person in Congress co-sponsoring this. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2047.26s)]
*  The way Congress works is you got to get to about 100 people to co-sponsor it. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2050.42s)]
*  And then the speaker calls up a vote on the issue. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2054.9s)]
*  But because you got big pharmas lobbying money, well, they they're so cynical. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2057.86s)]
*  They don't say they don't try to stop convince people to vote against it. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2063.38s)]
*  They try to stop the congresspeople from the speaker from bringing it for a vote. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2068.34s)]
*  So they would like they would invest in Mike Johnson. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2072.94s)]
*  They'll invest not just in Mike Johnson. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2075.54s)]
*  They'll invest. Is that libel or slander for saying that? [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2077.1800000000003s)]
*  No, no, it's just they would lobby with they would try to lobby Mike Johnson. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2080.54s)]
*  They'll try to lobby Mike Johnson. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2084.54s)]
*  Well, you know, there's this quote that I love from Dr. King. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2085.82s)]
*  He said, attack the evil system, not the individuals [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2088.86s)]
*  who happen to be caught up in the evil system. OK, got it. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2093.06s)]
*  So, yeah, there's some egregious cases. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2095.8199999999997s)]
*  The problem is the system is rotten. OK. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2098.7799999999997s)]
*  And the the they are pouring money into different campaigns, [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2101.06s)]
*  into different lobbyists, and basically are not going to allow a vote on this [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2106.62s)]
*  because they don't because they know if there's a vote and someone votes [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2111.4199999999996s)]
*  against Donald Trump and against lowering prescription drugs, [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2115.3399999999997s)]
*  the American people will be furious. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2119.66s)]
*  Are going to know who they are. Are going to know they are. Right. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2120.8999999999996s)]
*  And then we can call them out by name. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2122.66s)]
*  So they just don't want anyone to do it. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2124.3s)]
*  And this is how this is the game. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2126.34s)]
*  This is why we don't get Medicare for all. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2128.1800000000003s)]
*  Why we don't have health insurance. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2130.2200000000003s)]
*  Health insurance is not that we have. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2131.2200000000003s)]
*  We haven't had a vote on Medicare for all. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2132.5s)]
*  This is why we still have fossil fuel subsidies. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2134.82s)]
*  We haven't had a vote to get rid of fossil fuel subsidies. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2137.9s)]
*  This is why we still have a defense budget that is over a trillion dollars. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2140.78s)]
*  We don't get votes on cutting out the excessive contracts. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2144.78s)]
*  I mean, it's the game is to stop the vote. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2149.5s)]
*  And so it let me ask you that the thing I wanted to ask you [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2152.5s)]
*  actually the most in this conversation, do you know people who are just like, [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2155.7s)]
*  yeah, I'm done with politics because I don't think I can make a difference. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2158.7799999999997s)]
*  You know, it's just. Oh, yeah, I'm saying that's what I'm telling. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2161.7s)]
*  That's what I've noticed in the past few months [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2164.06s)]
*  on some of my favorite shows that I listen to and watch. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2167.3399999999997s)]
*  People are like, oh, I see now neither. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2170.54s)]
*  Nobody has our side. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2173.7s)]
*  Neither one of these groups, it feels like, have our side. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2175.7s)]
*  And you feel like it's just all these articles. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2178.94s)]
*  It's like, well, here's an article about this is going to happen. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2181.02s)]
*  And then people get in an uproar about it. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2183.82s)]
*  But nobody it's almost like it's all algorithmed perfectly [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2185.54s)]
*  to the amount of our attention span, where it just fades out of [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2189.5s)]
*  like the zeitgeist of discussion and zeitgeist just means [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2194.34s)]
*  like the circle of discussion at the moment, I think. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2198.78s)]
*  But so it's just like it just fades. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2202.42s)]
*  And then the next ball hits the air. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2204.22s)]
*  You're like, oh, look at that when that's it. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2205.74s)]
*  Transgenic something, you know, that when then it's like, oh, racism. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2207.22s)]
*  Again, here I am. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2210.82s)]
*  You know, forget about me. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2212.02s)]
*  And then it but it's the same after a while. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2214.02s)]
*  You just like I've seen this show so many times. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2216.5s)]
*  I think even our DNA is sick. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2220.02s)]
*  So I think you're having newborn children that are like, this is fucking bullshit. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2222.02s)]
*  Because even I think it's in our DNA now how long the charade has been going on. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2225.1400000000003s)]
*  And that's where I see people are like at a point where they're just at a loss. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2229.82s)]
*  How can that be stopped? [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2235.42s)]
*  How can that sort of thing actually be stopped? [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2236.94s)]
*  Can we do anything or does it have to fall on our representatives? [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2240.02s)]
*  The representatives aren't going to change things. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2243.7799999999997s)]
*  And this is this is my biggest concern for the country, that people keep getting [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2245.42s)]
*  disillusioned. They're like, I can't change anything. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2249.9s)]
*  I'm just going to focus on my own life. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2252.74s)]
*  Every two years, every four years, you get congresspeople, presidents saying [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2254.7s)]
*  they're going to do something. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2258.14s)]
*  They do some executive order. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2259.34s)]
*  It gets tied up in courts. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2260.94s)]
*  Big Pharma blocks any reform. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2262.5s)]
*  And what's the point? Right. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2265.38s)]
*  And then the problem is that the less people get engaged, the more power these [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2267.06s)]
*  lobbyists and moneyed interests have, because they don't want the engagement. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2271.06s)]
*  No. Right. They're perfectly fine with the system. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2274.7799999999997s)]
*  And they're like, OK, we we we will keep supporting our members of Congress [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2278.74s)]
*  and presidents every four years. They'll run on change. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2283.86s)]
*  Nothing actually changes and let people get more and more disillusioned. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2286.14s)]
*  That's what's going on. Oh, yeah. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2289.94s)]
*  I mean, I believe that we've been like a privatized communism. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2291.2599999999998s)]
*  That's what I say a lot. That's exactly what it seems like we're in. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2293.98s)]
*  And you're sitting here. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2297.66s)]
*  Tell me that our vote doesn't even really matter. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2298.7s)]
*  So, yeah, people are getting disillusioned like like. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2300.86s)]
*  But what do we do? [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2303.82s)]
*  So but that's why I gave that example of tobacco and DDT, when the country [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2304.9s)]
*  actually mobilizes, when they're like, we're done with it. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2310.02s)]
*  What do we need to do? Buy a Jeep or whatever? [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2313.34s)]
*  Well, I think one of the things you go do is like, look at who's taking money [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2315.06s)]
*  from these interest groups. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2320.7799999999997s)]
*  OK. Is there a site that we can look at that's reported? [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2322.38s)]
*  Open secrets, dot org, open secrets, dot org. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2325.7s)]
*  That'd be open cat. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2329.2599999999998s)]
*  I know Chuck Schumer's on it. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2331.9399999999996s)]
*  You know, and and everyone is that slander or not? [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2333.98s)]
*  Yeah, I think you're I think you're pretty you're well, [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2338.2599999999998s)]
*  not even close to the line of slander. We're not. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2342.2999999999997s)]
*  No, we're not. Oh, good. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2344.2999999999997s)]
*  Oh, yeah. That little money monkey is taking something. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2345.18s)]
*  But you can find it on open secrets or you can find out how much each person gets [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2347.8599999999997s)]
*  and from where you can find out how much. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2351.54s)]
*  So I don't take any PAC money, right? [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2353.3799999999997s)]
*  I don't take any lobbyist money. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2354.98s)]
*  But you can even find out individuals aggregated, how much they're getting. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2356.46s)]
*  And then if they're getting money, fine. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2360.42s)]
*  But then look at their voting record. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2362.7s)]
*  Are they are they [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2364.18s)]
*  voting on against big pharma? [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2367.38s)]
*  Are they voting against the big insurance companies? [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2370.86s)]
*  So first is just being aware. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2376.5s)]
*  But the second thing is we've got a demand that people have a vote [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2378.58s)]
*  on getting lower prescription drug prices. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2383.7s)]
*  Who do we ask that for from Mike Johnson? [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2386.3s)]
*  Mike Johnson. We got to say he's from Louisiana. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2388.02s)]
*  He's from Louisiana. And he's so I'll say it right now. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2390.3s)]
*  Mike Johnson, why don't you put the vote up? [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2392.58s)]
*  I mean, everybody wants this. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2395.82s)]
*  Everybody is tired of paying of watching people. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2397.22s)]
*  Medical debt is the number one cause of bankruptcy in America. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2402.14s)]
*  We know that it's bipartisan, right? [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2404.86s)]
*  It means both partisans like it. Yeah. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2407.3s)]
*  I mean, Trump, it's Trump's bill. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2409.1s)]
*  I mean, Trump's executive bill. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2410.58s)]
*  Just help us do give us something. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2411.98s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2413.94s)]
*  Two things he could do a vote on one is stopping the war in Iran. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2415.18s)]
*  I mean, that he can Massey and my bill, he has to give us a vote on it [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2418.7400000000002s)]
*  unless he played plays games. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2422.46s)]
*  And then to let's just focus on big pharma, getting getting big pharma. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2424.34s)]
*  Yeah, let's start with one lobby. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2428.58s)]
*  Let's start with one big lobby. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2429.98s)]
*  I think it's just the it's like, give us something, man. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2431.54s)]
*  I was like, because you know what I'm saying? [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2434.22s)]
*  He's from Louisiana. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2435.82s)]
*  So like that Louisiana is a state where it's like it's mostly about like people, [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2436.9s)]
*  right? Peer to peer. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2441.26s)]
*  It's like it's like the state. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2442.34s)]
*  It doesn't have a lot of I don't think we have one top. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2444.5800000000004s)]
*  We don't have one fortune 500 company, I don't think in the whole state, [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2449.42s)]
*  maybe energy, but I think that they left. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2452.0600000000004s)]
*  So we're a low income state. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2453.82s)]
*  But the one thing that we do have is each other's backs. Right. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2455.34s)]
*  And I just can't imagine that Mr. Johnson wouldn't bring this to the floor. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2459.1400000000003s)]
*  To the floor. Is that it? To the floor. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2465.86s)]
*  Bring it to the floor, Mike. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2467.5800000000004s)]
*  You know what I'm saying, bro? [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2469.1800000000003s)]
*  Like if people are sick, people are people are sick, man. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2470.1s)]
*  People are dying. You don't want to bring it to the floor. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2474.74s)]
*  I think that's fucking bullshit. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2477.06s)]
*  Now, if you are bringing it to the floor and Rose not telling me the truth, [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2478.58s)]
*  then I'm sorry, Mike. Right. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2481.46s)]
*  I'm sorry, dude. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2483.02s)]
*  And I got a good relationship with Mike Johnson. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2484.18s)]
*  Mike's awesome. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2486.5s)]
*  But but someone has just got to say he's a cool guy. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2487.2599999999998s)]
*  But he's got keys to the janitor's closet and it's time to fucking get [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2491.38s)]
*  it's time to get the broom out and sweep this shit out from under the rug. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2494.2999999999997s)]
*  That's what I feel like. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2497.94s)]
*  And you know what will happen if there's one time we take on one of these [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2498.78s)]
*  lobbying groups, whether it's big pharma, the rest will get scared. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2502.1000000000004s)]
*  Big insurance. The rest get scared. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2505.1400000000003s)]
*  And it's going to give hope to this country. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2507.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. My voice matters. Yeah. I can get involved. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2509.42s)]
*  Yeah. I can bring change. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2512.7000000000003s)]
*  I mean, we have been voting for change in this country since Barack Obama. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2514.46s)]
*  Every every four years, every two years, like kick them out. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2518.2200000000003s)]
*  Let's try someone else. Yeah. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2520.94s)]
*  And no one. And we put in a mixed guy. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2522.5s)]
*  You know, it's like that. We got an Indian guy showing up. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2525.42s)]
*  They're trying everything. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2528.14s)]
*  They're even trying the Indian guy. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2530.34s)]
*  I mean, you know, the country is the country is like, who do we need? [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2531.54s)]
*  They don't care about Indian black woman. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2535.9s)]
*  They're just like, get me someone who's going to actually bring change. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2539.9s)]
*  Give me it's like, give me somebody with some balls. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2543.3s)]
*  That's one reason why I support a lot of trans stuff, because I'm like, [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2545.3s)]
*  and maybe one of these women will have enough balls on them [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2548.3s)]
*  to fucking get us to where we need to be. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2551.46s)]
*  Like if if that's where we're at, where we have to attach balls [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2553.42s)]
*  to an emotional sense of empathy that a lot of times in a woman. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2556.9s)]
*  And that's who we need to get us over this hill of bullshit [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2560.1800000000003s)]
*  that we keep climbing up. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2563.3s)]
*  Then maybe that's what we need. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2564.5800000000004s)]
*  And you know what? It struck me when you said Louisiana doesn't have one [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2565.9s)]
*  Fortune 500 company. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2568.94s)]
*  You know, I represent Silicon Valley, you know, in my district. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2570.38s)]
*  Hold on. You know, my district. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2573.5400000000004s)]
*  On dude. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2575.34s)]

*  You and I spoke on the phone about this is crazy, bro. Yeah. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2580.26s)]
*  Did you read this somehow? [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2584.1000000000004s)]
*  Are you that Oz minimalist guy? I mean, I have. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2586.1400000000003s)]
*  No, you're not. I'm sorry. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2590.86s)]

*  And thank you, man, for talking about this stuff with me, man. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2595.2200000000003s)]
*  It even helps us like one thing I noticed even we spoke on the phone [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2597.7400000000002s)]
*  the other night, man, and it just like after I got on the phone with you, [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2600.5s)]
*  I felt a little better. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2603.54s)]
*  I was like, at least I have somebody to talk about this with. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2604.78s)]
*  Dude, yesterday I'm leaving this restaurant and a guy comes up to me. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2607.82s)]
*  He's missing a tooth. He's he was missing one. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2611.5s)]
*  And he was like, hey, man, thanks for speaking up about Palestine stuff. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2614.78s)]
*  And I was like, I said, well, I don't honestly, I don't know a ton about it. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2619.34s)]
*  It's just kind of how I feel. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2622.3s)]
*  And he goes, well, I think a lot of people are just afraid to speak up. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2623.58s)]
*  They're afraid if they speak against Israel, that they're going to be labeled [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2626.78s)]
*  an anti-Semite. And I was like, oh, no, I said, I understand that. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2629.5s)]
*  But I think that's just a verbal trap. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2634.26s)]
*  You know, I'd said you can have like I have tons of Jewish friends [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2636.02s)]
*  that I talk to every day. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2640.3s)]
*  And I don't think what Yennyahu is doing is good. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2641.7000000000003s)]
*  But anyway, I don't undersell yourself. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2644.7000000000003s)]
*  You have more common sense and your values than 90 percent of the foreign [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2646.6600000000003s)]
*  policy blob that has gotten us into all these wars and that has compromised [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2651.5s)]
*  our humanity. There's a reason the founders wanted Congress to be making [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2656.42s)]
*  decisions about war and peace. They trusted the American people. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2660.86s)]
*  Right. Like the kings of the past, when the founders were there, [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2663.86s)]
*  they would just do wars for their own glory. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2667.26s)]
*  And the American people were really the founders were really suspicious of that. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2669.8199999999997s)]
*  And so they said, you know what, we actually trust the farmers and the people [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2673.62s)]
*  in factories and ordinary Americans not to get us into all this stuff. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2677.74s)]
*  And they trusted people like you, Theo. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2682.5s)]
*  And the problem is that your voice has gotten out of Washington [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2685.06s)]
*  and not central to it. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2689.5s)]
*  But now we've got all these podcasts and they can't ignore you. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2691.74s)]
*  So good for you to try to take back citizen voices. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2694.8199999999997s)]
*  That's what this country was supposed to be. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2697.8199999999997s)]
*  Well, yeah, thanks, man. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2700.42s)]
*  I can't sit on like, what the fuck do I have to do with anything, dude? [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2701.54s)]
*  That's a shit that like I'm like, good. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2704.9s)]
*  You're a citizen. Right. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2706.98s)]
*  Now, that I agree with corrupted. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2708.14s)]
*  But then you're just shocked when you're like this me. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2709.86s)]
*  Like it's it's I think it's just always blows my mind. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2712.62s)]
*  I think the test in politics is like pretty simple. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2716.42s)]
*  I did two basic tests of politics. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2718.62s)]
*  Do you believe that the American people are smarter and wiser and have good values? [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2720.66s)]
*  Or do you believe in like a bunch of experts and elites? [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2725.98s)]
*  Like, I fundamentally believe like if we just allowed and listened to people, [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2728.3s)]
*  normal people, we'd be much better off in this country. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2732.3s)]
*  And the second is like, do you love and believe in this country? [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2735.6600000000003s)]
*  And I do. I think we're a good country. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2738.1000000000004s)]
*  I think we're the good guys. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2739.7000000000003s)]
*  Most Americans want to be the good guys. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2741.38s)]
*  And like we've gotten away from that. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2743.5s)]
*  Yeah, because we've got so many intermediate [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2745.2200000000003s)]
*  moneyed interests, lobbying interests, [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2748.1800000000003s)]
*  PhD, foreign policy experts who are corrupting the process. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2750.86s)]
*  Oh, yeah. They're corrupting, man. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2755.1400000000003s)]
*  They're bought and paid for. They're spies. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2757.06s)]
*  They're spies. And the sick part is to me, they're just killing themselves. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2759.2599999999998s)]
*  They're killing the future of their children's imagination. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2764.58s)]
*  Think of all the little things that you are hampering. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2767.94s)]
*  But then I guess, you know, [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2771.22s)]
*  money, you know, when you see things happen with money and it's hard to to to prevent. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2773.7799999999997s)]
*  So like you said, don't point at the person, try and point at the overall issue. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2778.86s)]
*  But I love that OpenSecret.org or com. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2783.02s)]
*  OpenSecret.org. They can they can do an analysis on everyone. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2787.38s)]
*  They can do it on me. They can do it. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2790.54s)]
*  And, you know, it's not like people know there's no one who's perfect in American politics. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2791.9s)]
*  Let's look at Mike Johnson. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2796.42s)]
*  I'll look at him right now. He's not going to be happy about it. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2797.98s)]
*  I'm sorry, Mike. He's a good man. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2799.82s)]
*  He's a man of faith. But like like the whole point is like, [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2801.26s)]
*  maybe he ends up actually putting this for a vote. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2804.5s)]
*  I mean, that would be safe. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2807.22s)]
*  But like, imagine being fucking Paul Revere. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2808.7400000000002s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? That's what he has a chance to be, [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2812.74s)]
*  because then we could all hold these people like you. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2814.7s)]
*  You fucking vote for this or you will never be back in this thing again. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2817.46s)]
*  Seriously, I think that's what people can do. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2822.42s)]
*  Why doesn't OpenSecret have an app that makes it really easy? [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2824.42s)]
*  Is it very easy to interface for people to be able to navigate [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2827.7s)]
*  how to find out who gets what and whatever? [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2831.42s)]
*  It's pretty easy. You can do it like that. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2833.42s)]
*  I would look at two things. One, how much money do they get from PACs? [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2835.1s)]
*  Which are the PACs? How much money do they get from lobbyists? [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2838.18s)]
*  And what are the industry groups? [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2841.14s)]
*  Now, if they're taking money and they're still voting against those groups, fine. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2843.7799999999997s)]
*  But what raises red flags is when they're taking money [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2848.22s)]
*  and they're not bringing something for a vote or they're voting [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2852.22s)]
*  with those industry groups. Right. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2856.5s)]
*  This says top contributors for 2022-23 for Mr. Johnson, [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2858.4199999999996s)]
*  American Israel Public Affairs Committee. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2864.3799999999997s)]
*  And that gets to the vote on Iran, right? That's AIPAC, right? [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2866.7799999999997s)]
*  That's AIPAC. And like Massey and I have shown independence on that. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2869.38s)]
*  So, OK, bring this vote so we don't get into war on Iran [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2874.02s)]
*  or and don't be beholden to groups who are telling you, no, no, no, [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2878.1800000000003s)]
*  let's just go along with Netanyahu and strike Iran. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2882.6600000000003s)]
*  Like it's fucking it's absolutely crazy. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2885.2200000000003s)]
*  And you know what the craziest thing is, is that we've had Thomas Massey [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2888.54s)]
*  scheduled to come in for like a month, right? He's great. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2892.26s)]
*  Yeah, well, he's one of the smartest members of Congress. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2894.6600000000003s)]
*  He's a maverick. That's what I like. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2897.02s)]
*  I think you and him both are mavericks. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2898.22s)]
*  Yeah. One thing that I admire about you is that you make choices [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2899.5s)]
*  that feel like your own. Right. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2902.18s)]
*  And the odds that you guys have a building together and then [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2904.8599999999997s)]
*  you're here today and he's coming tomorrow. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2907.8599999999997s)]
*  So is he coming tomorrow? That's awesome. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2909.58s)]
*  I want to put you on the same day. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2911.2599999999998s)]
*  So you at least get to say hey, but maybe maybe in the future. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2912.4199999999996s)]
*  We've done stuff. We've done a lot of stuff together. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2914.8199999999997s)]
*  We both have like people in our own parties who get upset [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2916.62s)]
*  because we take stances that are independent. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2920.14s)]
*  We work across the aisle. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2922.4599999999996s)]
*  But isn't that what Congress is supposed to be like? [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2923.4199999999996s)]
*  I mean, when you have a conversation with your buddies, [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2925.7s)]
*  do you always agree with like three of them and then have three of the others [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2928.3799999999997s)]
*  always disagree? It's like so irrational. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2932.7s)]
*  Usually like you'll agree with someone on one thing [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2935.9399999999996s)]
*  and you'll disagree on something else. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2938.8199999999997s)]
*  And yet in Congress, it's like you got these two teams [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2940.3399999999997s)]
*  and they're always supposed to be with their own parties. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2942.8599999999997s)]
*  And that's not how people actually are in real life. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2945.3799999999997s)]
*  They want people to just think for themselves. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2948.02s)]
*  I agree. And the craziest part is they're on two teams, [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2949.8599999999997s)]
*  but they should be playing for the same group. Right. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2952.8199999999997s)]
*  Team America. Yes. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2956.3399999999997s)]
*  And the fact that there's like it always feels the craziest part is [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2957.86s)]
*  it feels like it's you as a citizen against your own [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2961.7400000000002s)]
*  against that's what it feels like now. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2966.46s)]
*  It doesn't feel like this person. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2967.98s)]
*  It feels like that in the voting, like they're going to. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2969.78s)]
*  And then it feels like it just changes once they get over that hill. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=2971.82s)]

*  Your district in California, because you're a Democratic congressman, right? [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3150.82s)]
*  Correct. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3155.46s)]
*  From California. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3156.06s)]
*  Yeah. Your district is home to five companies worth over one trillion dollars. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3156.9s)]
*  Yeah. That includes Apple, Google, Nvidia, Tesla and Broadcom. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3160.94s)]
*  While half the country is deindustrialized and dependent. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3165.62s)]
*  You guys are you're in part of a you're you represent a very special district. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3170.82s)]
*  Yeah. How big is that tech lobby? [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3175.34s)]
*  Who are the biggest players? [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3178.34s)]
*  And are there multiple tech lobbies fighting against each other? [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3180.06s)]
*  Yeah. Well, first, let me just say that part of the problem in this country [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3184.14s)]
*  is that we've got 14 trillion dollars in my district [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3188.22s)]
*  and five companies over a trillion dollars. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3191.62s)]
*  And Louisiana doesn't have a single company in the Fortune 500. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3194.58s)]
*  Like, how did we allow this to happen in America? [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3197.54s)]
*  Where all the wealth is piling up in Silicon Valley? [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3199.9s)]
*  Oh, and one, sorry. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3201.8599999999997s)]
*  There are two Fortune 500 companies headquartered in Louisiana, [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3202.8599999999997s)]
*  Entergy and Lumen Technologies. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3205.2599999999998s)]
*  And I'm sorry about that, guys. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3207.46s)]
*  But even that, right? [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3208.62s)]
*  You got two companies and you have five trillion dollar [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3209.7799999999997s)]
*  companies in one district. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3212.14s)]
*  And a lot of what we've got to figure out is all these places [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3213.14s)]
*  like Johnstown, Pennsylvania, Lorain, Ohio, Downriver, Michigan, [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3216.42s)]
*  places totally hollowed out. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3220.3799999999997s)]
*  You go there and there's 30 percent hotel occupancy. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3222.18s)]
*  And then they're looking at Silicon Valley, making more money [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3225.66s)]
*  than any time in human history in the world. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3227.98s)]
*  Like, how in America did we allow this to happen? [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3230.18s)]
*  It's crazy. It's sad. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3232.46s)]
*  And it's unconscionable. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3235.02s)]
*  But is there a tech lobby? Yeah, there's a tech lobby. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3236.8599999999997s)]
*  Let me tell you one of the things that's been in the news that I know [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3239.62s)]
*  you've discussed, Palantir, right? [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3242.5s)]
*  And the contracts that they're getting, one hundred and thirteen million dollars [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3245.06s)]
*  to create this database on Americans. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3249.86s)]
*  And I know you asked someone. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3252.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I did. I mean, I asked J.D. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3254.94s)]
*  Vance about Palantir because I'm scared of it, right? [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3257.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3259.18s)]
*  This is just on my thing. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3260.46s)]
*  That's so crazy, dude. We are like this bananas. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3261.66s)]
*  I asked J.D. Vance about Palantir because I'm scared of it. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3264.38s)]
*  I felt like he gave kind of a political answer to me, right? [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3266.46s)]
*  Which is no judgment. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3269.46s)]
*  That's what I felt like. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3271.54s)]
*  I want our listeners to know why I'm concerned. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3273.8199999999997s)]
*  Well, one of the reasons is that Palantir got a seven [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3278.7799999999997s)]
*  hundred ninety five million dollar contract with the U.S. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3281.66s)]
*  Army for the Maven Smart System, which is using artificial intelligence [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3283.58s)]
*  tools for data fusion and target identification. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3288.22s)]
*  And then a 30 million dollar contract from the U.S. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3292.46s)]
*  Immigration and Customs Enforcement to develop an operating system [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3294.54s)]
*  that identifies undocumented immigrants and tracks self deportations. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3297.8199999999997s)]
*  So one of the things that's going on is that it feels like to me [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3303.18s)]
*  that they are asking Palantir or they are they've granted Palantir [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3307.02s)]
*  the opportunity to create this overall database. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3311.58s)]
*  And that is one thing that J.D. did talk about. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3314.06s)]
*  So maybe he didn't give that just a political answer. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3316.14s)]
*  He said he believes that it's just an overall database where like [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3318.1s)]
*  the local police department will now have [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3322.7799999999997s)]
*  them in the IRS, every IRS or everything will be synced up so that if you're [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3326.58s)]
*  involved in something in the world, everything will all the databases will be linked. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3330.98s)]
*  Right now, I felt like he would maybe know more about it because he has [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3335.2200000000003s)]
*  a relationship with this guy, Peter Thiel, [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3339.3s)]
*  who is one of the founders of it or something. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3343.06s)]
*  But I don't know if that's true. Right. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3345.86s)]
*  And maybe he didn't give me a political answer. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3348.42s)]
*  I think it felt I don't know. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3351.02s)]
*  You know what? Maybe it's just it [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3353.82s)]
*  wasn't the exact answer I wanted. Right. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3355.82s)]
*  And so that's why I'm kind of framing it like that. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3358.5800000000004s)]
*  So, yeah, I don't want to say that it just felt. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3362.1400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I think it wasn't kind of what I wanted to hear. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3364.82s)]
*  But that's also part of diplomacy. Right. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3366.98s)]
*  It's like I learned that recently. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3369.42s)]
*  It's like everything is you're not going to get everything. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3371.54s)]
*  Right. Nobody gets everything. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3375.5800000000004s)]
*  But anyway, that's what it said is this overall database. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3377.86s)]
*  And to me, I'm thinking, [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3381.6200000000003s)]
*  dude, if they have an overall database, right. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3384.1s)]
*  And they know every they're going to know everything. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3388.3399999999997s)]
*  To me, it feels like they that they'll just have this [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3391.02s)]
*  like all your information, your bank card, your blood type. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3394.14s)]
*  They'll know if you prayed this morning, they'll know just by like biometrics [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3397.58s)]
*  or whatever. If you've hit your knees, they'll know if you're feeling hopeful. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3401.2599999999998s)]
*  They'll know all of these things. Right. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3404.7799999999997s)]
*  What are things that we don't see coming from this Palantir deal? [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3406.86s)]
*  Do you think that those fears are realistic? What do you think? [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3410.2599999999998s)]
*  Well, I'm concerned. Let me. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3413.62s)]
*  Tell you what how I see the facts, first of all, I don't want to [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3415.06s)]
*  dunk on the vice president because I saw some of the interview [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3418.14s)]
*  and I love the fact that you have people here of different viewpoints, [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3420.9s)]
*  but he's got a particular view. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3424.66s)]
*  I mean, Peter Thiel founded Palantir. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3426.22s)]
*  Peter Thiel also, I mean, its public record, put fifteen million dollars [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3430.66s)]
*  into his campaign. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3434.42s)]
*  Yeah, we talked about that. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3435.34s)]
*  To make him a senator. So I'm not saying I'm not questioning him. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3436.58s)]
*  I'm just saying he's got a view of a relationship with Palantir. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3439.3s)]
*  And and we've got to figure out what are the objective facts. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3443.98s)]
*  I mean, the Palantir was founded by Peter Thiel [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3448.1000000000004s)]
*  and it was founded by CIA's Inqutel. Right. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3451.6600000000003s)]
*  This is what funds it. CIA is what do you mean? [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3453.98s)]
*  The CIA has a venture capital firm called Inqutel. Inqutel. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3456.3s)]
*  They gave the money initially for Palantir. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3460.3s)]
*  There are certain things that Palantir does that are important to our country. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3462.78s)]
*  They're using AI for military applications. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3466.1400000000003s)]
*  So that our fighter pilots can identify targets. Right. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3469.14s)]
*  We need certain things to make sure that we're the leading military in the world. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3473.1s)]
*  The problem is on this database that they're creating about Americans. Right. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3477.54s)]
*  And here's what they can do. They're not collecting the data. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3482.62s)]
*  They keep saying, I'm a data aggregator. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3485.7s)]
*  That means they're creating the program, the software where the government [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3487.66s)]
*  puts in the data, your financial records, your health records, [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3491.18s)]
*  your employment records. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3495.8599999999997s)]
*  They can buy your social media records and they put it in [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3497.14s)]
*  and Palantir spits out information. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3500.5s)]
*  Now, let me give you a concrete example of why this could be dangerous. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3504.02s)]
*  Let's say you're a comedian. You know, you know, comedians. Right. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3508.62s)]
*  My guess is before you became Theo von, there were times [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3512.46s)]
*  where as a comedian, you did shows that made you maybe five thousand bucks a night. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3515.74s)]
*  And maybe then you'd go a while and not make anything or make five hundred bucks. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3520.3799999999997s)]
*  Right. You got good shows, bad shows. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3524.3799999999997s)]
*  Oh, yeah. I mean, we made twenty five hundred bucks. Yeah, for sure. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3526.42s)]
*  And I'm sure you have still have friends who are in standup comedy [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3529.7000000000003s)]
*  and who have good nights and bad nights. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3534.34s)]
*  Now, Palantir, this database suddenly flags and does an algorithm. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3536.46s)]
*  And if someone's having income here and there, they say, well, [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3541.82s)]
*  is this person a risk for tax evasion? [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3545.9s)]
*  And suddenly they're getting audited because they're making a predictive model [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3548.46s)]
*  that comedian standup comedian should be making seventy thousand dollars a year. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3553.42s)]
*  And this person isn't disclosing their income. Are they a risk? [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3557.34s)]
*  We don't know with Palantir, are they target what their algorithm is targeting? [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3560.86s)]
*  Are they targeting ordinary people who have incomes that are variable? [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3565.86s)]
*  Or are they targeting the billionaires who are evading taxes? [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3570.7400000000002s)]
*  That is just a black box. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3574.34s)]
*  We don't know what data of your friends or my friends is being collected [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3576.1800000000003s)]
*  and whether they're actually creating a database. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3581.2599999999998s)]
*  All we need to do is have transparency. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3584.3399999999997s)]
*  I have three simple things that I think we should be able to get consensus around. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3586.66s)]
*  Your data should not be collected without your consent. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3591.62s)]
*  You need to know what data of yours the federal government has. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3596.02s)]
*  The federal government should not have any of your data [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3600.2599999999998s)]
*  that they don't absolutely need to provide you a service. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3602.8999999999996s)]
*  And then when Palantir, we should know what their algorithms are. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3606.62s)]
*  What are they doing this to get audit people who are like making 50 grand [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3610.22s)]
*  because they're accusing them of tax evasion? [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3615.02s)]
*  Are they targeting their algorithms on the very rich or on ordinary folks? [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3617.2599999999998s)]
*  What if you have a social media post that says things that are critical of the government? [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3621.66s)]
*  Is that information now the government has? It's like a whole black box. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3626.54s)]
*  Yeah, it's very scary. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3630.1s)]
*  It's very scary, too, because what if. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3632.46s)]
*  Another country says, hey, [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3637.06s)]
*  Palantir, you're our friends. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3640.8999999999996s)]
*  Why don't you target these people in America so we can start to bring them down? [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3642.66s)]
*  Right. Why don't you start to adjust their scores? [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3646.3799999999997s)]
*  Hey, why don't you why don't you not? [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3648.2999999999997s)]
*  Why don't you make it so that it makes it look like these people have already paid [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3652.2599999999998s)]
*  their taxes if they have it? You know what I'm saying? [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3655.58s)]
*  Like, there's just all these little things that could be plausible based on whoever [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3657.06s)]
*  owns the information, like whoever owns Palantir, whoever owns that algorithm [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3660.22s)]
*  is going to be able to basically puppeteer so many things that could be possible. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3664.46s)]
*  And even if they're not doing it, there's the fear that they could be doing it. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3669.66s)]
*  There's the fear they could. And there are no laws right now, right? [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3672.9s)]
*  We need laws saying, show us your algorithms, have an audit of the algorithms. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3675.1s)]
*  Who are you targeting? [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3680.78s)]
*  How do we make sure that you're not using this in a negative way? [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3681.78s)]
*  And basically, like Americans should know what data people have about. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3686.06s)]
*  I agree. I agree with you 100 percent, man. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3689.98s)]
*  And I want to say also, and I don't want like a company like Palantir to think like [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3692.86s)]
*  you're bullying me or you're doing this or that. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3696.7s)]
*  They just happen to be the company that has been picked. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3699.42s)]
*  And it's a scary time. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3703.14s)]
*  It's already so scary with like technology, everything happening so fast. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3705.5s)]
*  It's spooky. And you have a nuanced view. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3710.54s)]
*  Look, I have a nuanced view. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3712.9s)]
*  There's things that Palantir does that are important for a military, like just saying, [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3713.98s)]
*  oh, Palantir is all bad would be unfair to what they're doing on the pandemic. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3718.14s)]
*  They helped with distribution or what they've done on the military. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3724.34s)]
*  The point is, though, this American database building is scary and trying to predict [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3727.7s)]
*  whether someone is being a tax delinquent or not, trying to predict if they're going [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3732.3s)]
*  to be a financial risk, trying to figure out a profile on them. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3736.66s)]
*  And what we need, I really blame the lawmakers because what we need is the laws to [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3740.82s)]
*  protect people's privacy, to protect people's data, to protect the use of these algorithms. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3746.02s)]
*  Yeah, I agree 100 percent. And we're going to get to that. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3754.34s)]
*  I know you have the Internet Bill of Rights, and so we're going to get to that in a second. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3756.18s)]
*  Yeah, this is the push. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3761.38s)]
*  I want to say this. The push has put a key Palantir product called Foundry into at least [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3762.66s)]
*  four federal agencies, including DHS, HHS and others widely adopting Foundry, which [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3767.26s)]
*  organizes and analyzes data, paves the way for Mr. Trump to easily merge information [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3776.5s)]
*  from different agencies, the government officials said. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3781.1s)]
*  And that's what J.D. Vance said when he was here. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3783.78s)]
*  He was saying and I'm reading that off of The New York Times, give or take what you [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3785.8599999999997s)]
*  think about them. But that's what J.D. Vance said, that he thought it was just this [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3791.14s)]
*  overall compiling, this kind of aggregating of information. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3795.8599999999997s)]
*  He didn't think it would get super specific. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3799.2599999999998s)]
*  So I do you know, I don't think it felt a little politically, but that also could just [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3801.42s)]
*  be what he exactly believes. And that could be exactly what's happening. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3806.18s)]
*  I think there's just a lot of fear with it. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3809.7s)]
*  A lot of it says in here also creating detailed portraits of Americans based on [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3812.42s)]
*  government data is not just a pipe dream. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3816.78s)]
*  The Trump administration has already sought access to hundreds of data points on citizens [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3818.86s)]
*  and others through government databases, including their bank account numbers, the [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3822.34s)]
*  amount of their student debt, medical claims, disability status, et cetera. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3825.98s)]
*  So this will just I mean, I think this whole thing just goes further down that line. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3830.6200000000003s)]
*  And I don't even have just like knowing everything about everyone. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3835.1800000000003s)]
*  And I don't even think that it's it's Republican or Democrat. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3838.8999999999996s)]
*  I just think it's where we are in time right now with technology and that it's very [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3842.7s)]
*  scary and that you can start to see how big the tech lobby is. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3847.4599999999996s)]
*  I want to say this. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3851.74s)]
*  One thing about Palantir, though, that a lot of people have had issues with is what [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3854.8199999999997s)]
*  they're doing in Gaza, right, with A.I. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3859.2599999999998s)]
*  targeting. And this is off of I read this online. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3861.8599999999997s)]
*  And so that makes it probably incredible. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3866.9s)]
*  But allegedly Palantir software is reportedly used by the Israeli military to help [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3868.38s)]
*  select targets in Gaza. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3873.38s)]
*  Its data mining and A.I. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3874.98s)]
*  systems can process intelligence reports, communication intercepts and surveillance [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3876.46s)]
*  data to generate lists of potential targets in a matter of minutes. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3881.1800000000003s)]
*  A process that previously took hours. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3885.5s)]
*  Lavender and Habsora, which are two of the kind of, I guess, programs or overall idea [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3888.98s)]
*  names and Habsora means the gospel. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3895.66s)]
*  Investigations indicate that two A.I. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3899.46s)]
*  systems, Lavender and Habsora, are at the core of this collaboration. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3901.58s)]
*  Lavender assigns Palestinians a threat score based on metadata, social media and [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3906.2599999999998s)]
*  movement patterns. These systems reportedly operate with significant error margins, and [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3911.3399999999997s)]
*  their recommendations can be enough to authorize deadly strikes, sometimes with minimal [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3916.3799999999997s)]
*  human oversight. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3920.62s)]
*  Gaza is described as a live laboratory for these A.I. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3922.4199999999996s)]
*  technologies where new systems are trained, tested and refined in real time combat [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3926.66s)]
*  conditions before being marked globally as battle tested solutions. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3931.4199999999996s)]
*  I think that's where a lot of the fear is. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3935.8999999999996s)]
*  It really is. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3938.02s)]
*  If that can happen there and this they're capable of that, then how do I know if when [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3939.22s)]
*  I'm walking down the street. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3945.02s)]
*  That some decision I made years ago or something, a bullet's not just going to fly out of [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3947.3s)]
*  anywhere and go through my head from a drone or something, you know, that I think is the [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3951.98s)]
*  big fear about this. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3956.34s)]
*  And I think some people don't even know it. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3957.46s)]
*  I think the big fear with technology. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3958.9s)]
*  Is that crazy for me to say that? [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3961.38s)]
*  No, I mean, I don't think it's crazy to fear that machines should not control human [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3963.2200000000003s)]
*  beings, right? [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3968.6200000000003s)]
*  I mean, we look, technology can do a lot of good, it can do a lot of bad. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3969.3s)]
*  But the key principle here is are human beings going to be in charge from what you described? [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3974.46s)]
*  It looks like that A.I. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3979.66s)]
*  is being used. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3981.62s)]
*  They're selecting targeting. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3982.46s)]
*  And the biggest negative in that whole paragraph you read is without human oversight. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3983.9s)]
*  I mean, you still need a human being saying, OK, wait, we're not just going to go do [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3988.98s)]
*  strikes because A.I. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3994.22s)]
*  tells us there's a risk. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3995.14s)]
*  There's some women and children there. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3996.42s)]
*  Let's not have those strikes. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3997.74s)]
*  There's a hospital there. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=3999.22s)]
*  Right. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4000.3399999999997s)]
*  And I think that one of the things we need to adopt for the United States is there has [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4001.02s)]
*  to be a human being making decisions before any military use, any military strike. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4005.98s)]
*  Yeah, at least give me the fat guy with the doughnut sitting there and be like, nah, [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4010.98s)]
*  forget it. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4014.66s)]
*  Nah, nah, nah. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4015.14s)]
*  It's like we're now going to be we're celebrating. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4016.2999999999997s)]
*  We're celebrating. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4019.3399999999997s)]
*  You would I rather have a human being, right? [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4020.3399999999997s)]
*  Because there's some compassion. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4022.06s)]
*  There's some. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4023.18s)]
*  I agree. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4023.54s)]
*  That there's some sense of guilt. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4024.06s)]
*  A.I. is not going to feel guilty. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4025.98s)]
*  A.I. is not going to feel a compassion. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4027.42s)]
*  A.I. is not going to have any accountability. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4029.14s)]
*  A.I. doesn't even go to sleep at night. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4031.2999999999997s)]
*  How can you trust something that doesn't even go to sleep at night? [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4034.1s)]
*  Right. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4036.46s)]
*  You know, that doesn't even give God a chance to rebuild the inside of it while it's [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4036.8199999999997s)]
*  resting. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4040.2999999999997s)]
*  That's pretty beautiful. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4041.14s)]
*  Yeah, I do not understand this, man. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4042.06s)]
*  And that's very scary. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4044.2999999999997s)]
*  And that happens. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4045.5s)]
*  It's happening. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4046.3799999999997s)]
*  Allegedly. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4047.06s)]
*  I want to say that it's allegedly you can go look after yourself happening in Gaza that [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4047.7s)]
*  this and it to me, it does start to feel like that. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4052.8199999999997s)]
*  You're like, it has been such a massacre. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4055.54s)]
*  They are so overabundant. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4057.3399999999997s)]
*  I mean, it's basically people climbing into holes of rubble, looking for pieces of [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4059.2599999999998s)]
*  their children and family members. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4064.3799999999997s)]
*  And it's like we're watching it all. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4066.94s)]
*  It's it really does feel like am I am I now part of some sick experiment? [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4068.7799999999997s)]
*  Like how long do I sit and watch before I raise my hand or say something or at least [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4075.5s)]
*  some part of me that has a voice inside of me like says I don't want to just take me [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4079.54s)]
*  out. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4086.22s)]
*  I don't want to be in this game anymore. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4086.66s)]
*  I don't I don't like it, man. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4088.18s)]
*  I don't like it. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4089.98s)]
*  We're going to keep it moving right there because we have some other stuff that I want [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4092.22s)]
*  to say. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4095.5s)]
*  Oh, I wanted to think about this with you at some point, like if we lay this layer of [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4095.7799999999997s)]
*  technology over our society, right. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4100.26s)]
*  And whether we do it now or it's in the future with AI, this all knowing kind of layer [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4102.5s)]
*  that knows like if you've eaten knows your blood pressure knows how far you've walked [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4109.0599999999995s)]
*  today, knows how much money you have, knows the emojis you sent recently to kind of get [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4113.38s)]
*  an aggregate idea of how you're even feeling as a human, then that almost becomes your [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4117.86s)]
*  God. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4124.42s)]
*  Right. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4124.98s)]
*  In a weird way, I know that some people say nothing will ever be my be be a new God for [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4125.5s)]
*  me. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4130.5s)]
*  I feel that and I agree with that and I respect that. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4131.42s)]
*  But if you're say future generations, if they're raised under this cloud of that's all [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4135.66s)]
*  knowing, then that would they almost at some point pray to this algorithm that it would [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4143.22s)]
*  give them a lottery ball of some sort of thing or something. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4151.54s)]
*  Does that even I mean, it's kind of Ray Brad Bellion or whatever, Brad Wellian or whatever, [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4154.14s)]
*  or Brad Burwellian. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4159.9800000000005s)]
*  But does that make any sense to you, man? [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4161.820000000001s)]
*  Well, that's why we have to keep our humanity. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4164.46s)]
*  You know, some of the stuff in Silicon Valley is crazy where these tech leaders really are [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4166.900000000001s)]
*  trying to be God like. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4172.42s)]
*  Let me give you two examples. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4175.3s)]
*  Have you heard of this thing called cryonics? [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4176.54s)]
*  You know, where we had a guy on who did the freezing. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4180.26s)]
*  Yeah, you did. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4182.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4183.82s)]
*  I mean, basically they want to like freeze your body if you die, if I die, freeze your [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4184.34s)]
*  body and your brain so that some future medical technology could bring you back to life. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4188.9s)]
*  Some pervert probably too. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4194.18s)]
*  And Peter Thiel has done this. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4195.78s)]
*  Supportedly, Sam Altman at OpenAI has done this. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4197.66s)]
*  Have signed up for it. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4200.06s)]
*  Have signed up for it. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4200.78s)]
*  That's the reporting. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4201.38s)]
*  Now, I'll tell you why that's so bad to try to be immortal. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4203.02s)]
*  One of my favorite speeches of all time was Steve Jobs. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4206.54s)]
*  Steve Jobs founded Apple computers. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4210.06s)]
*  He dies of pancreatic cancer. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4212.06s)]
*  He gives this commencement speech and he says that life invented death and death is a [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4213.62s)]
*  change agent because death allows for the removal of the old guard and for new ideas [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4222.38s)]
*  and new creativity to come about. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4229.1s)]
*  Like you're supposed to make way for a new generation. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4231.740000000001s)]
*  We're supposed to be mortal. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4236.9800000000005s)]
*  So you have these people who are trying to be immortal. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4239.26s)]
*  Now, why does that matter? [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4242.14s)]
*  Because this is partly AI, right? [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4243.06s)]
*  If you don't have a sense of your own mortality, your own limitations, you're not going [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4245.780000000001s)]
*  to have a humanistic sense of putting people over machines. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4249.46s)]
*  A second example with AI, with these tech leaders, they want to build these tech cities. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4252.9400000000005s)]
*  Have you heard of that? [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4257.34s)]
*  I've seen like pieces in Memphis and stuff where people are getting sick because of like [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4258.660000000001s)]
*  data being uploaded and stuff in their neighborhood and shit like that. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4262.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I mean that's storage. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4265.580000000001s)]
*  You know, that's a big issue of how these data centers are being built and whether they're [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4266.540000000001s)]
*  going to cause pollution or dislocation. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4271.14s)]
*  But they really want to build these tech cities, not just a city. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4273.22s)]
*  It's like a secular genesis. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4276.580000000001s)]
*  Like they want to build a new civilization with algorithmic norms, with morality that [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4278.900000000001s)]
*  they're setting, not like that was set by God or years of civilization. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4285.66s)]
*  And it's scary. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4291.099999999999s)]
*  It's scary because it shows an arrogance, a lack of humility. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4292.34s)]
*  My sense is, look, AI can be an incredible tool if it helps you figure out how many [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4297.14s)]
*  steps you walked and when you're sleeping and how to be nutritious. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4303.62s)]
*  But it has to be subservient to human agency. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4307.62s)]
*  We have to have laws that say ultimately human beings are in charge and we have to make [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4313.82s)]
*  sure that we're teaching people to have the critical thinking skills and the autonomy [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4320.82s)]
*  to be able to use these programs and not be subservient to them. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4326.5s)]
*  And that's to me, that's the biggest question for humanity. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4330.62s)]
*  It's ironic because, you know, you're asking almost deeper questions than any of these [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4334.34s)]
*  Sunday talk shows in Congress. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4338.26s)]
*  Like in Congress, we're busy fighting about like who insulted who and like who's up, [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4339.46s)]
*  who's down in the polls. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4344.5s)]
*  And we just have this technology revolution that's going to change how all of us work, [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4345.58s)]
*  that is going to make people afraid if they're going to lose their jobs. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4350.82s)]
*  That's going to try to create the super intelligence, wondering whether we're making [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4355.18s)]
*  the decisions or machines are making the decisions. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4360.02s)]
*  That's what we should be talking about. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4362.34s)]
*  Right. And we should be talking about it in a way that is... [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4365.06s)]
*  And I guess there are ways to talk about it in ways that are exciting. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4367.780000000001s)]
*  But I just think right now with what you have seen, like, to me, the destruction and the [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4371.02s)]
*  stuff caused by Israel now, it makes it very scary right now with that company, because [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4380.42s)]
*  you've just seen that. And then you're now that's the company that's going to oversee [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4385.34s)]
*  our country. What's going to keep me from being a Palestinian to the next guy who starts [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4388.18s)]
*  the button in the morning from his cell phone and then goes off on his yacht, you know, [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4393.46s)]
*  and just... [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4397.66s)]
*  The Constitution, hopefully. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4398.18s)]
*  Right. Right. Right. Hopefully the Constitution. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4399.34s)]
*  Thanks for your patience today, Mr. Kana. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4402.9800000000005s)]
*  Roe is fine. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4405.94s)]
*  Roe. Rohit. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4406.7s)]
*  That's your real name? [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4408.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4408.86s)]
*  Rohit? [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4408.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4409.3s)]
*  How do you say it? [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4409.62s)]
*  Rohit. You know, when I was a kid, people used to, I still remember this, they used to [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4410.58s)]
*  say Rohit, Rohit, Rohit is on fire. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4414.38s)]
*  And then I figured out it was like making fun of my my full name. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4418.1s)]
*  And then when I used to go up to hit on Little League, I used to chant, Roe can't hit, [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4421.62s)]
*  Roe can't hit. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4427.5s)]
*  Watch the bunt. But, you know, we have this in common, right? [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4428.5s)]
*  I looked up that you've got a long name that... [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4432.18s)]
*  Oh, yeah. What's your full name? [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4434.34s)]
*  It's Rohit Kana. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4436.26s)]
*  Rohit Kana. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4437.62s)]
*  But, you know, we're both I don't want to geek out because I was I loved the literature, [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4438.54s)]
*  but it's like quintessentially American to in some ways change your name and to make [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4443.22s)]
*  your story right. Like my favorite character in all of American literature is this guy, [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4450.06s)]
*  Jay Gatsby. And his name was James Gatz. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4454.1s)]
*  He was from North Dakota. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4456.900000000001s)]
*  And he said, well, James Gatz is not a sophisticated name. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4458.540000000001s)]
*  So I'm going to call myself Jay Gatsby. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4461.5s)]
*  And he reinvents himself. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4463.620000000001s)]
*  And in different ways, you, Theo Vonn, like no one would have thought you'd be Theo Vonn [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4465.26s)]
*  growing up. No one would have thought this geeky Indian kid is going to go represent [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4469.580000000001s)]
*  Silicon Valley. And Rohit Kana is going to become Ro Kana representing the most economically [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4474.06s)]
*  powerful place in the world. But like, that's the story of America. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4479.54s)]
*  Right. That's the story of self-invention. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4482.54s)]
*  And it's something that we've kind of lost that it's why my parents came here. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4485.66s)]
*  And the question is, how do we how do we get that back? [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4490.62s)]
*  Like, you know, we've talked about all the negative stuff, which I get. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4492.94s)]
*  But how do we how do we get people believing in this country again, believing that we [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4496.66s)]
*  can do big things again? [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4500.34s)]
*  Well, I think there's some ways. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4502.18s)]
*  And we'll go into this now, then, because we're on my list here and I am using a list [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4503.7s)]
*  today. That's OK. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4507.46s)]
*  Because it's an important conversation. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4509.62s)]
*  Because of A.I., job replacement has already started to happen. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4512.66s)]
*  Yeah. Right. What kind of worker protections can be implemented, do you think? [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4517.14s)]
*  Because I know you have an Internet Bill of Rights and then we can talk about that right [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4520.78s)]
*  after that. Yeah. Or it may be part of it. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4523.42s)]
*  But what do you think? [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4525.38s)]
*  Because we should be protecting the human. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4527.1s)]
*  Right. At a certain point, we should be protecting the human. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4529.0199999999995s)]
*  And we could go two ways with A.I. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4531.1s)]
*  Right. One way of A.I. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4532.82s)]
*  is like this could create a lot of new jobs. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4534.7s)]
*  We could build new factories now that are productive in this country. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4537.46s)]
*  You could have someone in a classroom in Kentucky now who because A.I. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4541.3s)]
*  doesn't get to go to Harvard or Stanford, but suddenly has the knowledge of the whole [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4545.46s)]
*  world at their fingertips and can get that kind of education. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4548.9800000000005s)]
*  You can have someone working in a small rural town making 80 grand or 100 grand [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4552.78s)]
*  because they're a content creator or you know how many content creators there are in [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4558.18s)]
*  this country? 1.5 million who make some money doing content creation or they can do [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4563.299999999999s)]
*  digital marketing or they can help A.I. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4568.94s)]
*  start a small business. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4571.0599999999995s)]
*  So like my point is how do we get A.I. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4572.339999999999s)]
*  to lessen the wage gap, to create economic opportunities as opposed to just [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4575.299999999999s)]
*  eliminating jobs? [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4581.219999999999s)]
*  That scary part is what if they're going to start to eliminate jobs? [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4582.299999999999s)]
*  Like if you're a truck driver, what if they say, OK, we're just going to have self [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4586.78s)]
*  driving trucks? That's why we need to pass laws. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4590.339999999999s)]
*  Saying no, I need a truck driver for safety. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4592.7s)]
*  Like would you fly on a plane right now without pilots? [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4595.9s)]
*  Same thing. I wouldn't. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4599.42s)]
*  So let's make sure we have basic safety in terms of recognizing that we do want [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4601.179999999999s)]
*  workers and workers get to have a say in how to use this technology. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4606.0599999999995s)]
*  You know what the scariest thing is? [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4609.98s)]
*  The unemployment rate for kids between 21 and 29 who have a college degree. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4611.26s)]
*  Everyone often says, oh, if you have a college degree, you're going to be employed. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4616.78s)]
*  Actually, it turns out if you have a vocational skill, skilled trades, 21 to 29, [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4620.86s)]
*  you have a 2 percent unemployment rate right now. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4625.0599999999995s)]
*  College degrees, 15 percent. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4627.34s)]
*  That could go up to 30 percent if with A.I. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4629.62s)]
*  with these entry level jobs. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4633.74s)]
*  And one of the things we need, I think we need the federal government to help [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4635.94s)]
*  incentivize people getting apprenticeships after they're done with a trade school or [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4642.0199999999995s)]
*  a college so they can actually get a job, make sure they're subsidized. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4647.54s)]
*  Create a government future workforce administration that hires them so they get a [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4650.46s)]
*  few years of experience and then can go on to the private sector. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4654.66s)]
*  Most importantly, everyone needs to understand technology and A.I. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4658.74s)]
*  The old cliche is you're not going to be replaced by A.I., but you will be replaced [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4663.06s)]
*  by someone who knows A.I. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4667.22s)]
*  And in our schools, K through 12, everyone should have a technology class. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4669.42s)]
*  China is aiming by 2030 to have universal literacy on A.I. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4675.06s)]
*  No, no, yeah, not to interrupt you, but I think, well, one thing you said here that [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4679.139999999999s)]
*  was really great was anybody. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4682.66s)]
*  I agree. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4684.94s)]
*  A lot of jobs are going to it's going to be scary. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4685.58s)]
*  I'm amazed. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4687.94s)]
*  I was talking to my brother yesterday. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4688.82s)]
*  I was like, I said, bro, do you have your kids learning about A.I. right now? [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4689.78s)]
*  Like, are they learning about it? [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4693.58s)]
*  Are they starting to use it? [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4694.74s)]
*  And my brother's like, no, I don't think so. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4695.82s)]
*  I said, dude, I feel like it's coming so fast that it could change things really fast. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4697.7s)]
*  Now, one thing you mentioned is anybody can learn this right now. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4703.419999999999s)]
*  It's almost like a great reset in a lot of ways. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4707.94s)]
*  So you have the kid who couldn't afford to go to Harvard, right? [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4710.78s)]
*  Now, who couldn't afford to go to MIT, whose father doesn't have the nepotism, [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4713.62s)]
*  because we certainly live in like a nepa society now in a lot of ways, whose father [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4718.26s)]
*  didn't have that capability. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4723.78s)]
*  Now that kid can get on a computer for probably six weeks or something, really [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4725.099999999999s)]
*  focused and crack down and could probably get a job. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4731.139999999999s)]
*  I was literally looking the other day, I was like, I need somebody who knows [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4735.339999999999s)]
*  everything about A.I., right? [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4738.54s)]
*  I need somebody who can program and design and help with A.I. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4740.259999999999s)]
*  Like I want to start like an A.I. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4743.62s)]
*  studio, right? [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4744.86s)]
*  And I know that's pretty cool. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4745.54s)]
*  And I got to do it fast because everybody else is going to be doing it. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4746.419999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you could have a new in. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4749.62s)]
*  So even someone like you needs A.I. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4751.259999999999s)]
*  right? [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4752.66s)]
*  Like a hundred percent. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4752.9s)]
*  I feel every day and there's a little part of me that pull like a little string [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4753.78s)]
*  inside of me that gets reminder like, hey, man, you have to get on top of this. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4757.62s)]
*  I know other things are pressing. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4761.379999999999s)]
*  I hope kids who are listening to this hear that because a lot of people want to be [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4762.38s)]
*  like, how do I be Theo Vonn? [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4765.42s)]
*  How do I be this guy with a podcast or do stand up, be a stand up comedian? [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4766.46s)]
*  And even someone like you, you want to do that. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4771.900000000001s)]
*  You got to know A.I. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4773.900000000001s)]
*  Look, one of the things I say is, look, I was really good as an Indian kid in math, [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4775.1s)]
*  right? [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4778.54s)]
*  Like every kid is. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4778.74s)]
*  But you don't need math. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4779.9400000000005s)]
*  Like you don't need algebra and calculus anymore to do A.I. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4781.02s)]
*  You don't have to do. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4783.82s)]
*  You're going to shake up all of Madras. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4784.74s)]
*  You know, you don't have to be like I was like some nerdy kid who did like math [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4788.34s)]
*  leads and, you know, got good grades on math tests. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4793.139999999999s)]
*  Don't don't need it anymore. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4796.5s)]
*  If you want to be an advanced coder program or find. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4797.98s)]
*  But the amazing thing with A.I. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4800.7s)]
*  is now it does all that for you. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4802.139999999999s)]
*  You know what jobs are actually being eliminated? [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4803.66s)]
*  The coder jobs, the guys who did all the math, the A.I. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4805.7s)]
*  is doing the coding for them. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4809.099999999999s)]
*  Imagine those guys sitting there building A.I. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4810.66s)]
*  and it's only going to take his job. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4812.9s)]
*  So now, like, OK, you don't have to be the kid who did algebra and calculus, [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4815.379999999999s)]
*  not to say that you shouldn't learn math. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4819.94s)]
*  You should learn it for your own sake. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4821.82s)]
*  But even if you don't like math, now you can just learn this technology. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4822.86s)]
*  You just have to be comfortable with it. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4826.42s)]
*  How do you use it to do a business? [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4828.46s)]
*  How do you use it to learn about the world? [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4831.179999999999s)]
*  And you can be the one asking it questions and prompting it. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4833.98s)]
*  And it can create a whole new level of jobs. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4837.299999999999s)]
*  And you know what? The exciting thing is you don't have to leave Louisiana for so [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4840.82s)]
*  so many times we said, OK, you got to go move to Silicon Valley, [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4844.54s)]
*  move to New York and people in the gold rush or whatever. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4847.780000000001s)]
*  And people are Appalachia. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4850.46s)]
*  We're like, yeah, no, it's really beautiful here. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4851.54s)]
*  No, I really like living in my small town in my rural community. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4853.54s)]
*  Like, no, I don't want to live in New York. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4856.54s)]
*  No, I don't want to go to Rose District. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4858.46s)]
*  I often ask all these people in my district who are like, oh, OK, [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4860.02s)]
*  just tell them to move here and move to a tech place. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4863.7s)]
*  I was like, well, are you going to move to Louisiana? [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4866.06s)]
*  And no hands go up. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4868.38s)]
*  Then I was like, why are you so arrogant to think they want to live here? [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4869.26s)]
*  They like it where they grew up with their families. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4871.98s)]
*  But now you can like live there and you learn a little bit of tech [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4874.9s)]
*  and you can work for almost any company in the country, in the world. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4878.58s)]
*  That is the opportunity if we do this right. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4882.3s)]
*  And we should start with kindergarten through 12th grade. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4885.78s)]
*  It's just like reading or writing. I agree. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4888.42s)]
*  I have brothers, kids going to do it. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4890.7s)]
*  I hope so. I'll say this. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4892.42s)]
*  They're not working for me one day if they don't. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4893.9s)]
*  This is also interesting because it's like every now and then [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4896.58s)]
*  there's something that makes it where you can jump. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4898.54s)]
*  You can jump up a cast or assist. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4901.299999999999s)]
*  You can jump a couple of levels. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4904.139999999999s)]
*  And I believe that right now this is that thing. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4905.78s)]
*  I said the same exact thing. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4908.099999999999s)]
*  You know, the wealth gap, there are two huge wealth gaps in this country. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4909.339999999999s)]
*  One is between places like Silicon Valley and factory towns, [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4914.0199999999995s)]
*  rural towns that were decimated. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4917.339999999999s)]
*  And the other is a racial wealth gap. Ten to one white families [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4918.98s)]
*  and Asian American families tend to one the wealth of people [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4923.74s)]
*  who are African American, Latino American technology. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4926.78s)]
*  You can do that, scale it in one generation. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4930.34s)]
*  If we can if we can get rural communities, factory towns, [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4932.780000000001s)]
*  towns in the black south, the opportunity to do things with tech [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4936.9400000000005s)]
*  and build companies, build wealth, be content creators. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4941.14s)]
*  Oh, hell yeah. Black AI, dude. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4944.820000000001s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4946.860000000001s)]
*  Build me a trap beat homie. Let's get this. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4947.780000000001s)]
*  No, but I agree with you. It's an it's an opportunity, right? [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4950.9800000000005s)]
*  And and that is it's like it's an opportunity. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4954.22s)]
*  Some people like there's no and I know that's just one thing. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4958.14s)]
*  But also another thing is that trade jobs, like you're saying, [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4960.62s)]
*  you're still going to need plumbers for sure. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4963.26s)]
*  You're still going to need [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4964.86s)]
*  you're still going to want the hands on the wheel of a human being, I believe. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4966.34s)]
*  But there's a lot of trade jobs. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4969.74s)]
*  You're not going to be able to replace those. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4971.06s)]
*  You talked about an Internet bill of rights, right, which you tried to pass, [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4973.62s)]
*  I'm guessing, or tell me about that. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4977.98s)]
*  Tell me a little bit about that experience. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4979.22s)]
*  And why do we need that? [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4980.82s)]
*  Do you feel like we already answered that or no? [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4982.54s)]
*  I could go do it briefly. I mean, I OK. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4984.14s)]
*  There's a guy, Tim Berners-Lee. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4986.740000000001s)]
*  You should have him on some time. Tim. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4988.3s)]
*  What's the name? Tim Berners-Lee. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4989.700000000001s)]
*  He is the founder, basically, of the World Wide Web. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4991.18s)]
*  He's the one of the people who made the Internet the Internet. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4994.54s)]
*  And I'm sure he was like knighted or something. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=4999.18s)]
*  And, you know, so he and I talked and we came out with this Internet bill of rights [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5002.3s)]
*  when you remember that Facebook Cambridge Analytica scandal [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5008.14s)]
*  where people lost their data on Facebook and profiles were made. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5011.42s)]
*  And basically, it said in this country, no one should take your data [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5015.98s)]
*  without your consent. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5020.74s)]
*  And you should know where your data is. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5022.42s)]
*  I mean, there are other parts to it, but it's like pretty simple. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5024.0599999999995s)]
*  You own your data. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5026.62s)]
*  You control your data. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5028.099999999999s)]
*  And you should know what's happening with your data. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5029.62s)]
*  And I think it and by the way, you should be compensated, to some extent, [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5031.5s)]
*  for the use of your data. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5034.86s)]
*  If you if you consent, there should be a data dividend in this country. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5036.3s)]
*  And I think that is not a partisan issue. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5039.98s)]
*  It is an issue that's going to become increasingly important [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5042.9400000000005s)]
*  with things like this database that may be being made. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5045.860000000001s)]
*  Like, you should know. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5049.02s)]
*  Do you know, Theo, right now, what the government knows about you? [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5050.18s)]
*  Do you know if there's a profile on you? [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5053.22s)]
*  Do you know? Like, what if that database is wrong? [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5055.34s)]
*  Pisces, I know that I'm trying to think of what else. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5057.58s)]
*  I don't know. Yeah. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5061.3s)]
*  Like you should you should know. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5062.42s)]
*  You should be able to consent. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5064.66s)]
*  You should be able to get something deleted if they have an incorrect information. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5066.02s)]
*  And what that applies to the government and it applies to big corporations. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5069.78s)]
*  I don't want Google having some profile on Rokana. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5074.0599999999995s)]
*  I mean, so we introduced this in 2017. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5077.94s)]
*  2017, Congress to this day has not been able to [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5082.46s)]
*  to introduce or pass any Internet Bill of Rights. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5087.26s)]
*  There are no protections. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5089.94s)]
*  You know, when Josh Hawley say there's no protections, [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5091.1s)]
*  oh, you just mean there's no protections for people. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5093.18s)]
*  I mean, no protection of people. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5095.22s)]
*  Josh Hawley once and there are places where I actually agree with Hawley. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5096.82s)]
*  He had Mark Zuckerberg stand up and apologize to those parents. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5100.139999999999s)]
*  Those parents saw that. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5104.0199999999995s)]
*  And someone said to me, you know what he should have also done? [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5105.219999999999s)]
*  He should have had the whole Congress stand up and apologize. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5107.54s)]
*  The problem isn't just these tech companies, it's the Congress. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5110.38s)]
*  We've we've had this stuff going on for 10 years. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5113.46s)]
*  And Congress has not passed an Internet Bill of Rights. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5116.62s)]
*  And one of the things I say is, like, I know these people. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5119.62s)]
*  I know they I know how they think they're going to run circles around you. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5122.299999999999s)]
*  We got to hold them accountable, have the tech guys saying, hold them accountable. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5125.5s)]
*  Why won't they do it? [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5129.7s)]
*  The same reason as before. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5130.74s)]
*  Why won't the tech companies do it? [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5132.54s)]
*  Who's lobbying? Who's lobbying against them? Big tech? [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5133.86s)]
*  It's the it's tech lobbying. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5135.86s)]
*  It's Internet service provider lobbying. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5138.66s)]
*  It's these lobbyists. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5141.22s)]
*  And they don't want and we haven't. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5143.26s)]
*  Can you imagine this country that has a constitution that is a country [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5146.34s)]
*  founded on freedom and we don't have any federal legislation saying [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5150.06s)]
*  you own your data? [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5154.02s)]
*  Oh, well, well, that's what it's all become. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5155.580000000001s)]
*  It's all part of this thing where all you become is data and then you don't own it. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5157.820000000001s)]
*  And then you're part of a new country without you even realizing it. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5162.900000000001s)]
*  You got put into a whole new continent [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5167.18s)]
*  titled or owned by whatever [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5170.5s)]
*  tech monarchy owns it or all of Jarchi owns it. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5173.620000000001s)]
*  And then that's where you are. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5176.740000000001s)]
*  People were like, I'm in America. Like, that's fine. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5178.620000000001s)]
*  You can believe that all you want. Right. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5180.660000000001s)]
*  But if another company owned your information, [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5182.78s)]
*  that company can't really even be sued. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5185.98s)]
*  There's a there is also part of that big, beautiful bill that keeps state led [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5188.0199999999995s)]
*  like a I. It's the worst part of that bill. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5192.7s)]
*  The AIC. You can't even sue the people. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5195.62s)]
*  Bring it up for me. Get to that really quick. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5197.7s)]
*  Ten years. They want no state to have any regulation on AI. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5199.34s)]
*  Ten years to give a free pass to these big tech companies. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5204.66s)]
*  No regulation. I I spoke out against it and my phone blew up [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5208.78s)]
*  because I had all these angry tech leaders saying, Ro, [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5212.1s)]
*  how are you speaking out against these moderate terms? [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5214.540000000001s)]
*  That's when I knew I was doing the right thing. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5216.5s)]
*  That's when you're doing the right thing. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5218.22s)]
*  But you know, you know what's sad? [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5219.900000000001s)]
*  They own this country and because you and I both have gone to some of these towns [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5221.9800000000005s)]
*  that lost their factories, that lost their industries. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5225.900000000001s)]
*  And we screwed them twice. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5229.02s)]
*  First, we took away their jobs. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5230.540000000001s)]
*  We literally shipped their jobs offshore or watched their jobs go to China. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5232.26s)]
*  These towns started to deindustrialize. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5237.22s)]
*  There was pain, there was opioids, there were drugs. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5239.86s)]
*  And then what do we do? [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5242.34s)]
*  We get social media companies to find algorithms on their data [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5243.54s)]
*  to start targeting them with content, [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5248.38s)]
*  which is causing young girls to commit suicide, [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5251.74s)]
*  which is getting some people more addicted to drugs, [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5254.86s)]
*  which is getting people to be angry at each other. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5257.74s)]
*  It's like we screwed them taking away their jobs. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5260.299999999999s)]
*  And now we're taking their data and screwing them with social media. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5262.74s)]
*  I just feel like the devil is at the gates, man. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5266.179999999999s)]
*  I feel like we are at such an important time. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5268.34s)]
*  And I know people have probably said that before. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5270.5s)]
*  And what the fuck do I know, dude? [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5272.18s)]
*  I am I'm not mentally handicapped or whatever, but I am definitely adjacent. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5273.62s)]
*  Right. But I do know some things. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5278.34s)]
*  I know this that I'll say this. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5280.22s)]
*  This is in that big, beautiful bill. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5281.900000000001s)]
*  And I don't know everything that's in it, but this is one thing that really stood out to me. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5284.38s)]
*  And I asked JD about this. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5287.66s)]
*  It says for a full 10 years after enactment, no U.S. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5290.5s)]
*  state or locality may enforce any law or regulation that limits, [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5294.38s)]
*  restricts or otherwise regulates artificial intelligence models, [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5298.0199999999995s)]
*  artificial intelligence systems or automated decision systems [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5301.5s)]
*  entered into interstate commerce. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5306.0199999999995s)]
*  Only laws encouraging use or deployment of AI are excluded. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5308.179999999999s)]
*  That means that we won't have any legal recourse against a machine. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5312.78s)]
*  Basically, like, you know how you said you want hands on a wheel? [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5318.339999999999s)]
*  Yeah. If now a state wants to pass a law saying [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5321.179999999999s)]
*  you got to have a truck driver on a truck, you can't do that. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5323.74s)]
*  If your state wants to pass a law saying you can't have an algorithm [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5326.98s)]
*  in social media that gets young girls addicted to content [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5330.86s)]
*  that makes them more likely to have eating disorders, can't do that. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5335.46s)]
*  So it's just going to be federal have the only federal will be the only one. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5339.219999999999s)]
*  And you know what? [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5342.0199999999995s)]
*  I do you not see how crazy do you not see what is at the gates? [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5342.5s)]
*  And by the way, you're not going to get federal legislation [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5347.62s)]
*  because the way you get federal legislation in this country is [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5350.0599999999995s)]
*  when you get a bunch of states that pass legislation, [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5352.94s)]
*  then you get the industry coming to the federal government saying, [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5355.38s)]
*  oh, there are too many state laws. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5357.7s)]
*  Can you just get one federal standard? [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5359.0599999999995s)]
*  But if you don't have the state laws, you're never going to have industry [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5360.9s)]
*  coming saying, let's get a federal standard. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5363.66s)]
*  So it's basically like, let's have AI just develop. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5365.54s)]
*  And that is the problem, right? [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5368.54s)]
*  There's the beautiful AI vision of how your nephews could learn this [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5370.219999999999s)]
*  and build wealth and we could have some people in one generation [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5374.46s)]
*  have economic security. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5378.86s)]
*  And then there's the dystopian AI vision, [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5380.0599999999995s)]
*  where big government and big companies control our data [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5382.54s)]
*  or making decisions based on what predictive algorithms [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5386.26s)]
*  are telling about about us, where we lose control to machines. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5391.02s)]
*  And the question is, which way are we going to go as a society? [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5396.34s)]
*  And who's going to benefit? [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5399.1s)]
*  Is the AI revolution going to be like globalization? [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5401.18s)]
*  All the money piles up in my district. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5403.74s)]
*  You know, we'll be sitting here five years from now instead of 14 trillion dollars. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5405.9s)]
*  It'll be 50 trillion dollars and places like Louisiana will still be shafted. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5409.5s)]
*  Or is the AI revolution going to be owned by American citizens? [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5414.74s)]
*  Like to me, that is the whole biggest question of our society right now. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5418.1s)]
*  I agree. I agree, man. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5422.9s)]
*  It's one of the reasons why I was so grateful that you were willing to come here [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5424.58s)]
*  so quick and then we're able to talk about this stuff, because I wanted to have [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5427.38s)]
*  I just I don't know, sometimes I'll just get afraid that I'm not educated [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5430.9s)]
*  enough to have certain conversations. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5434.22s)]
*  You know, you're you're you're you're perfectly you're educated [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5435.54s)]
*  to the point where it's your values. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5439.099999999999s)]
*  And that's I think that's actually one of the things that the tech folks rely on. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5440.98s)]
*  And it's like what the foreign policy establishment relies on. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5444.82s)]
*  It's like the old priests. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5447.78s)]
*  Like we've got some secret language, secret vocabulary. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5449.379999999999s)]
*  You can't talk about the Middle East because you haven't studied [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5452.94s)]
*  the Middle East as much as us. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5455.0599999999995s)]
*  You can't talk about technology because you don't know the math [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5456.379999999999s)]
*  that went into the coding of AI. Who cares? [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5459.74s)]
*  These aren't questions of technological competence. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5462.139999999999s)]
*  These aren't questions of foreign policy competence. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5464.7s)]
*  These are questions of human values. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5467.0599999999995s)]
*  This is a moral. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5468.94s)]
*  It's a moral issue. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5469.7s)]
*  But just but just to be sure to go back. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5471.299999999999s)]
*  So on on that point, we're talking about that part that's in the big, beautiful bill. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5472.7s)]
*  It will not leave you very much legal recourse, is that correct? [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5477.179999999999s)]
*  It'll leave you no legal recourse if you're a state. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5480.62s)]
*  You can't do any regulations. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5483.259999999999s)]
*  What if you're a citizen? [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5484.82s)]
*  And if you're a citizen, you have almost no legal recourse. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5486.0199999999995s)]
*  It's basically saying, look, let's trust the AI developers to just develop AI. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5488.94s)]
*  And the argument they give is, well, we don't want to lose out to China. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5493.82s)]
*  Well, you know what? [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5497.94s)]
*  I don't want to live in a society like China. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5498.58s)]
*  China has a social credit score on every single person. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5501.0199999999995s)]
*  Like if you're in China, you get ranked 10. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5504.219999999999s)]
*  You're a great Chinese citizen. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5506.86s)]
*  One, you're not, you know, because you didn't pay your bills [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5508.5s)]
*  because you were rude to someone, you made fun of someone. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5511.58s)]
*  But your karate sucks. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5514.179999999999s)]
*  That's just the car. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5515.74s)]
*  The the the argument can't be like, we're going to stay ahead of China. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5516.9s)]
*  So let's become like China. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5520.139999999999s)]
*  How about we're going to stay ahead of China without being China? [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5521.62s)]
*  And we're going to have regulations because we're Americans. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5524.9s)]
*  And it's here now, though, people understand it's here now, right? [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5528.3s)]
*  Like we can't keep kicking this the ball. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5532.179999999999s)]
*  I feel like we're on the goal line. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5535.0599999999995s)]
*  We're on the go. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5537.34s)]
*  This is the thing that the tech leaders, why they're so involved suddenly in politics, [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5537.86s)]
*  they understand that this is the whole ballgame. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5541.7s)]
*  Like, well, we're fighting over all this other stuff. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5544.38s)]
*  Oh, where is the funding for Medicaid and tax? [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5547.94s)]
*  Oh, very important. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5550.82s)]
*  They're like, well, we just want the whole enchilada. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5551.9s)]
*  We just we just want to we just want to control data and control jobs and control the economy. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5554.14s)]
*  And these people in Washington are kind of clueless. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5559.820000000001s)]
*  Like there are people and members of Congress. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5562.38s)]
*  I'm going to say the names were asking the Google CEO about the iPhone. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5563.900000000001s)]
*  They don't know that Apple makes the iPhone. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5567.780000000001s)]
*  You know, they're they're technologically illiterate and they're just being run circles around. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5570.22s)]
*  And now they're saying like Congress, you're so illiterate. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5575.780000000001s)]
*  Just don't do anything. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5578.46s)]
*  Don't have any regulation. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5579.54s)]
*  Let us just do everything. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5580.580000000001s)]
*  Really? We didn't fight a revolution in this country to let the tech billionaires get to decide our future. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5581.7s)]
*  And and I think what we need, you know, FDR was a traitor to his own class. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5589.1s)]
*  He came from from New York, Wall Street Finance. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5593.7s)]
*  He said, no, I'm not going to let finance dictate America. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5597.3s)]
*  And in some ways, we need people from technology saying, yeah, we love technology, but no, [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5601.62s)]
*  technologists don't get to call the shots in this country. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5606.22s)]
*  Theo's buddies get to call the shots. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5609.58s)]
*  And by the way, they got better judgment than you or just human beings. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5611.46s)]
*  People with some I think because I'm not I don't know the best morals in the world or anything, [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5615.0199999999995s)]
*  but I feel like I fucking try to be alive because that's what I'm I'm sentenced to right now is being alive on Earth. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5618.58s)]
*  So why don't why don't why isn't there a tech leader that comes out was like, [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5625.66s)]
*  this is the app that shows you exactly who's doing what. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5628.86s)]
*  So you can this is how you start to change. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5631.74s)]
*  Like we need something that's step by step, almost for dummies. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5633.94s)]
*  And I hate to say that, but we've all become dumbed down by our phones and games. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5637.62s)]
*  But we need to know if we have I mean, because I just feel like this is it. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5642.14s)]
*  We got to find a developer who's like, you know what? [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5645.82s)]
*  I'm going to fucking try to save humanity. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5648.66s)]
*  You know who we could have and maybe you should have him on here is Steve Wozniak. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5651.5s)]
*  He's the he's the guy who developed Apple with Steve Jobs. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5654.74s)]
*  Cool guy. Cool guy. And he's a humanist. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5657.74s)]
*  He's he believes human values. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5659.58s)]
*  We need some people like Wozniak. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5661.62s)]
*  I mean, there are others. The was, you know, it. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5663.58s)]
*  And, you know, Steve Jobs, in many ways, was a was a humanist. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5666.18s)]
*  People who understand technology, but are like, you know, technology in the service [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5670.26s)]
*  of human values, we're not gods. We don't want to rule. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5674.42s)]
*  I often say we need Silicon Valley in the service of America, [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5678.66s)]
*  not America in the service of Silicon Valley. Amen. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5681.740000000001s)]
*  Amen. I agree. I would love to meet Mr. Wozniak and talk to him. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5684.34s)]
*  OK, you campaigned for and I'm going back to some of my charts here, [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5688.9800000000005s)]
*  but that's all right today, guys. That's where I'm at. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5693.900000000001s)]
*  It's been a long week and it's been a long life. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5695.74s)]
*  You campaigned for Bernie Sanders in 2016 and co-chaired his presidential run in 2020. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5700.26s)]
*  Yeah. Is that right? That's right. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5705.46s)]
*  We've asked him directly what happened. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5707.34s)]
*  You know, and I was always a I wish that they made it so that [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5710.58s)]
*  whoever won the presidency, the other like if a president was Republican, [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5714.219999999999s)]
*  the Democrat, the vice president had to be Democrat. Right. Yeah. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5718.34s)]
*  I wish it was like that, because then it seems like there would be a common ground [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5721.139999999999s)]
*  or invited them to govern together. Right. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5725.1s)]
*  You know, like that has to be some sort of teamwork because otherwise you outsource it. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5727.58s)]
*  And it's just it seems like it's so much more expensive. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5730.780000000001s)]
*  But what I was going to ask you right here was [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5733.18s)]
*  and we've asked him directly what happened. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5736.46s)]
*  But in your opinion, why do you think that he lost out on the nomination both times? [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5737.9400000000005s)]
*  Because I think that's had an effect on [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5741.9400000000005s)]
*  how the Democratic Party has been perceived over the years. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5744.18s)]
*  The establishment screwed him. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5746.54s)]
*  I mean, there's no doubt about that. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5748.06s)]
*  He should have been the nominee in 2020. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5750.18s)]
*  You had the whole party basically like drop out, [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5752.7s)]
*  tell people to drop out and endorse Joe Biden. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5755.900000000001s)]
*  They resurrected Joe Biden. He had lost Iowa. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5758.58s)]
*  He came in like fourth or fifth. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5762.1s)]
*  He lost New Hampshire fourth or fifth. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5763.54s)]
*  It's never happened in the history of the party in recent history [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5765.14s)]
*  that someone is losing that badly and then wins. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5768.7s)]
*  And they suddenly see Bernie's winning. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5771.5s)]
*  Iowa is winning. New Hampshire is winning. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5773.26s)]
*  Nevada unstoppable. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5774.74s)]
*  Nate Silver had him at 70 percent odds to win the nomination at that point. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5776.34s)]
*  And the party just reacts and they say no. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5780.099999999999s)]
*  And they convince Buttigieg to drop out and endorse Biden. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5784.0199999999995s)]
*  They convinced Beto to endorse Biden. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5787.46s)]
*  They convinced Klobuchar to endorse Biden. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5790.0199999999995s)]
*  How did they convince them all? Was it funding and stuff, you think? [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5792.94s)]
*  Well, I think they said, look, you want to have a future. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5795.46s)]
*  You could be in the you can be in the cabinet. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5797.78s)]
*  You can we're going to be for you. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5800.0199999999995s)]
*  And then they're like, Bernie can't win. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5802.139999999999s)]
*  Bernie can't win. Come on. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5803.46s)]
*  Donald Trump just won. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5804.98s)]
*  He's talking about invading Greenland. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5806.259999999999s)]
*  And you're telling me we can't have Medicare for all. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5808.06s)]
*  I mean, like the one thing that Donald Trump has shown you is like [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5810.14s)]
*  you can say what you believe and win anyone. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5813.26s)]
*  And and that's like, you know, JD had that, too. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5816.620000000001s)]
*  He was like, you come on. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5819.580000000001s)]
*  I disagree with him. But you know where he stands. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5821.06s)]
*  Like just campaign with your heart, campaign with your ideas. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5823.14s)]
*  That's what. And Bernie was speaking to people who were outsiders, [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5827.02s)]
*  who were underdogs. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5831.42s)]
*  You know, I think that's why you and I resonate. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5832.900000000001s)]
*  I was an underdog growing up. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5834.860000000001s)]
*  I was not I was not supposed to be a politician. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5836.54s)]
*  I didn't have a father who was a senator, a rich person or a congressperson. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5839.94s)]
*  Like no one would have thought this Indian kid of Hindu faith [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5845.3s)]
*  was going to have any shot to get elected to dogcatcher in this country. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5848.78s)]
*  But Bernie was speaking for all the folks who weren't supposed to make it, [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5852.62s)]
*  who aren't making it in this country. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5856.42s)]
*  Bernie was underdog. He was an underdog. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5858.0199999999995s)]
*  That's another thing about Trump, though. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5859.78s)]
*  Trump was also an underdog. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5860.9s)]
*  You know, I'm saying he did have part of that with them. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5862.0199999999995s)]
*  A lot of these. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5863.62s)]
*  But I do I do think there's a there's people that love an underdog man. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5864.58s)]
*  OK, let's build the primary early, right? [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5868.7s)]
*  Who should the Democrats run? [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5871.86s)]
*  Well, first of all, do you think we need to still have just Republican [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5874.42s)]
*  and Democratic Party, or do you think there's value in getting a big financier [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5876.94s)]
*  to support like a third party, like, say, if Elon Musk decided to go [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5881.82s)]
*  and support a third party? [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5885.3s)]
*  I think there's a value in third parties. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5886.9s)]
*  Here's the problem I have in terms of just like third parties running for president. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5888.62s)]
*  A lot of times it has to be a billionaire. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5892.18s)]
*  And then you're like, OK, is that billionaire really going to have the values [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5894.06s)]
*  of the working class? [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5897.02s)]
*  But in terms of parties, and I'm one of the few people in the Democrat Party [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5898.540000000001s)]
*  who says this, I think have more parties. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5902.1s)]
*  You know, if like the Democrats are like, oh, your third party is going [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5904.820000000001s)]
*  to take away votes from us. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5907.46s)]
*  That was like, be better. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5908.620000000001s)]
*  Like, it's not the voters job to vote for you. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5909.700000000001s)]
*  It's your job to convince the voter. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5912.22s)]
*  I never understood this with like the whole Harris Trump race. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5913.9800000000005s)]
*  They're like, well, you know, their Jill Stein is taking votes away from us. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5916.660000000001s)]
*  I was like, her job is to run. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5921.66s)]
*  Your job is to convince people to vote for you. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5923.7s)]
*  Yeah. You know, it's like if like Apple computers wasn't selling iPhones, [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5926.06s)]
*  they're like, well, this other third party company is taking iPhone cells away from you. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5929.26s)]
*  OK, well, why aren't you making the iPhone better? [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5934.02s)]
*  Right. And so I think having more parties is good. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5936.1s)]
*  I still think the Democratic Party is the vehicle where we can really have [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5938.66s)]
*  a progressive working class agenda. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5942.34s)]
*  I think we've got to reform it in the way Bernie Sanders was was trying. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5944.46s)]
*  And, you know, and I think and I think the Republican Party, I hope, will become more [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5948.3s)]
*  anti-war, will become more working class centered so that we have reform in this country. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5952.7s)]
*  Yeah, I just don't know how we can keep going with nothing, because that's what it [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5960.58s)]
*  starts to almost feel like is that we're just we're not even getting anything. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5963.9800000000005s)]
*  I've heard you talk about the idea of economic patriotism. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5968.5s)]
*  Yeah. What does that kind of mean when you say that? [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5971.14s)]
*  I like that terminology. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5973.1s)]
*  My parents came to this country in the 1960s. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5975.22s)]
*  It was the time John F. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5978.26s)]
*  Kennedy said, let's go to the moon. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5979.18s)]
*  Let's dream big. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5980.860000000001s)]
*  This country was humming. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5982.18s)]
*  We were building things. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5983.46s)]
*  We were making things. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5984.860000000001s)]
*  We were doing things for civilization. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5986.42s)]
*  I think that's what can bring us together. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5988.1s)]
*  Let's have a Marshall Plan, not for Europe, a 21st century Marshall Plan for America, [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5989.66s)]
*  where we start to build new factories, new industry, new AI centers, new AI academies, [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=5995.62s)]
*  new universities, new trade schools. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6001.38s)]
*  And we come together in this country, white, black, Latino, Asian, to build things in [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6004.82s)]
*  America. And by the way, I think that's something even some of the mega folks would [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6009.78s)]
*  could get behind. Like, what is it? [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6014.259999999999s)]
*  Why? We need a new national purpose. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6016.219999999999s)]
*  You know, and when John F. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6018.66s)]
*  Kennedy was president, 60 percent of Americans had trust in government. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6019.82s)]
*  Today, it's probably like down to less than 20 percent. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6023.38s)]
*  And the reality is, you know, we talked about the PAC money and the lobbyist money. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6026.099999999999s)]
*  But most people go into Congress. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6029.98s)]
*  They are still they want to do something for America. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6031.82s)]
*  They really believe that I do. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6034.42s)]
*  I believe that about, you know, J.D. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6036.62s)]
*  Vance and I've gotten into arguments. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6038.26s)]
*  I believe that about him. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6039.46s)]
*  Like, I believe that I do too about him. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6040.700000000001s)]
*  I do believe that. You know, I believe that about most people. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6042.860000000001s)]
*  Like, I think they have a story. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6045.700000000001s)]
*  They they want to do something good. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6047.54s)]
*  The system is so broken. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6049.58s)]
*  But you know, what we need, again, is a vision that's going to inspire us to come [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6051.26s)]
*  together to do things. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6055.9400000000005s)]
*  And an economic patriotism, I think, would be one of those visions like let's make a [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6058.22s)]
*  let's redevelop communities. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6062.94s)]
*  Yeah, me and Mike, I was talking to Mike Rowe and we've kind of started to put the [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6064.78s)]
*  wheels on creating like a place that's just American products, right? [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6068.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. Go to Boston. It's just American. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6072.74s)]
*  You know, start to see what that would look like. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6074.58s)]
*  So that would be really interesting to have like a new American kind of QVC. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6076.38s)]
*  But all this stuff is just American stuff. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6080.7s)]
*  And one of my bills is actually to give a tax credit at the end of the year if you [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6082.74s)]
*  keep your receipts and buy American. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6087.62s)]
*  So, look, you buy an American glass, American book, you get deducted on your taxes. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6089.38s)]
*  I love that. I mean, I love that if we could. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6095.54s)]
*  And also, if we just didn't give money to some of these other places and stuff, it [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6097.860000000001s)]
*  would be I think it would be we'd have a lot of money for people. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6101.06s)]
*  Yeah, it's funny that American American manufacturing doesn't even seem to be a [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6103.9800000000005s)]
*  part of the Democratic talking points anymore. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6106.820000000001s)]
*  No, which is so ironic because FDR industrialized the whole country. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6108.860000000001s)]
*  You know, the tragedy of, let's say, of Elon Musk, who I've known, is that he [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6111.9800000000005s)]
*  could have been Bill Knudson. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6116.66s)]
*  I know you're like American history. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6118.179999999999s)]
*  Bill Knudson was this guy who was running GM. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6119.58s)]
*  KNUDSEN? [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6122.82s)]
*  KNUDSON. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6124.0199999999995s)]
*  And you can look him up. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6125.86s)]
*  And he was running GM. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6127.58s)]
*  And FDR says, you know, we need you. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6129.379999999999s)]
*  We need you to build American industry. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6131.98s)]
*  We were making a thousand planes a year. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6134.9s)]
*  Within a few years, Bill Knudson takes it to 300,000 planes. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6137.54s)]
*  And instead, I mean, the tragedy in my view of Musk is he was undermining and [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6141.94s)]
*  destroying like the NIH and all these agencies where what we needed is someone [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6146.14s)]
*  to come in and say, let's industrialize this country. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6150.58s)]
*  Let's work with labor to build new industry, new jobs. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6152.900000000001s)]
*  The Democrats did that. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6157.38s)]
*  Like we I don't understand how we let Trump become the made in America guy. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6159.14s)]
*  We need to be the party that says, here's our vision for making things in America. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6163.46s)]
*  And wouldn't it be great if the argument in this country was who was going to [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6167.58s)]
*  build America better? [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6171.06s)]
*  And like Trump's like, here are my ideas. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6172.46s)]
*  And we were like, here are our ideas. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6173.900000000001s)]
*  And maybe you take the best of those ideas. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6175.46s)]
*  But how about a common goal again? [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6177.26s)]
*  Like, I think the country is exhausted. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6179.58s)]
*  We're embarrassed. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6182.42s)]
*  They see all of us in Congress and I'm guilty of this, too, sometimes. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6184.26s)]
*  And we're arguing and name calling. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6187.42s)]
*  And they're like, yeah, but my life, like I can't afford a house. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6190.26s)]
*  My kids aren't going to have the same job I did. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6195.02s)]
*  I don't know where I'm going. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6197.46s)]
*  I don't know what's happening with this country. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6199.18s)]
*  Like, just get your act together and get some direction that's supposed to be the [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6201.14s)]
*  greatest country in the world and start working together on Team America. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6204.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6208.06s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's the dream is fading. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6209.58s)]
*  I feel like some and I don't want to be a pessimist, but I don't I feel like I [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6214.46s)]
*  don't want to say the dream is fading. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6219.38s)]
*  I don't want to say that's that it feels like. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6221.42s)]
*  We don't all have the same dream that's fading. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6226.860000000001s)]
*  That's the part that's not feels like it's fading. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6229.3s)]
*  It used to be that you go to bed at night and it felt like you all had this [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6231.9400000000005s)]
*  universal dream, you know, I think. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6234.26s)]
*  Yeah, I think and we've we've lost that. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6236.14s)]
*  Like, what is the common American dream? [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6237.9800000000005s)]
*  And and we've won. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6240.9800000000005s)]
*  We're so divided, right? [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6241.9400000000005s)]
*  Life is so different for some people in Silicon Valley than it is for folks who are [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6243.26s)]
*  like, how am I going to pay my medical bills? [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6247.1s)]
*  How am I going to pay for rent? [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6249.1s)]
*  How are my kids going to have a decent job? [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6251.34s)]
*  And the other thing is that we lack a common sense of vision. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6254.14s)]
*  Like, what are we doing as a society together as Americans? [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6257.94s)]
*  And I, you know, I think if if we get people talking about that and that's why I say a [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6261.74s)]
*  Marshall Plan, economic patriotism, rebuilding this country. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6266.5s)]
*  And that doesn't mean old factories like it's going to be the new modern factories, [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6270.179999999999s)]
*  new industries. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6273.379999999999s)]
*  Well, I think people it's also going to get weird if people that some of the greed [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6274.419999999999s)]
*  doesn't end that people are just going to want to see the rich start to suffer. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6277.62s)]
*  And that's when shit can get really weird. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6280.62s)]
*  That's when you start getting people into revolutionary thought. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6283.58s)]
*  But then maybe who knows? [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6286.66s)]
*  Maybe we just, you know, we just slowly drift off into the ether of our sofa with [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6287.860000000001s)]
*  a cheese. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6293.34s)]
*  It's on our chest. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6294.3s)]
*  You know, I don't know some man with fake breasts laying there eating cheese. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6295.06s)]
*  It's, you know, just drifting into the ether of existence. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6298.860000000001s)]
*  That would be sad if we don't. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6301.62s)]
*  But I hope that's not our pole revere, right? [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6304.1s)]
*  I hope that there is still like a lot of people who believe in something. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6306.1s)]
*  And I think there is. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6309.54s)]
*  And I think there's people that want something new. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6310.38s)]
*  I'm glad I'm glad that even just saying asking Mike Johnson for help with that [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6312.58s)]
*  thing, you know, I think that that's neat just because I didn't even know that we [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6316.3s)]
*  could do that. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6319.820000000001s)]
*  You know, what was anything else we wanted to talk about? [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6320.5s)]
*  We're almost there. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6324.42s)]
*  Let me see. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6325.9800000000005s)]
*  One thing that J.D. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6327.42s)]
*  Vance said that was really interesting the first time I spoke with him was he said [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6328.46s)]
*  that a lot of Congress people and representatives will go turn over to be or [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6332.38s)]
*  senators will turn over to be lobbyists. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6339.14s)]
*  Because they don't get paid enough by the government type of situation. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6341.94s)]
*  Is that true? [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6346.74s)]
*  Take me down a little bit of that discussion where the salary is better being [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6347.38s)]
*  a lobbyist than it is to be on on the this side. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6352.74s)]
*  Well, he's absolutely right. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6356.78s)]
*  And it's terrible what happens when you are in Congress. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6358.0199999999995s)]
*  You're working on the Armed Services Committee overseeing defense contractors. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6361.98s)]
*  Then you'll retire and suddenly you'll become a lobbyist for the defense industry. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6366.82s)]
*  You'll go from making one hundred seventy thousand dollars a year to making a [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6372.5s)]
*  million dollars a year. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6375.94s)]
*  And that's why I have a bill. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6377.3s)]
*  It's called the Drain the Swamp Act or my political reform act. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6379.3s)]
*  And it says ban members of Congress from ever becoming lobbyists. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6382.1s)]
*  Now, you know, Harry Truman won World War Two. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6385.86s)]
*  He did more than anyone in Congress put together. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6389.26s)]
*  And he started NATO and Harry Truman at the end of his presidency. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6392.26s)]
*  The guy who wins World War Two sets us up for the post post World War Two order, [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6396.26s)]
*  writes to someone when he was invited to give a speech. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6402.860000000001s)]
*  He said, I'm a little embarrassed. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6405.58s)]
*  Betsy and I can't afford the train ride. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6408.22s)]
*  Can you pay for the train ride? [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6410.54s)]
*  Happy to give the speech. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6412.5s)]
*  Right. It used to be you went into politics not to get rich. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6413.46s)]
*  And I don't begrudge people who are wealthy. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6417.14s)]
*  There are a lot of people who are wealthy, but you shouldn't be in public service [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6419.3s)]
*  to make money. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6423.38s)]
*  And afterwards, you can do a lot of things. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6424.3s)]
*  Go do something in AI. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6426.740000000001s)]
*  Go do something. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6428.54s)]
*  You know, don't go and lobby. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6429.18s)]
*  Don't become a member of Congress who's just going to cash out by lobbying. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6431.26s)]
*  It's something I will never do, but it's also a ban we should have. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6436.820000000001s)]
*  And I, you know, maybe we can make that a bipartisan effort. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6439.860000000001s)]
*  I don't see how it couldn't be because every human wants it on both sides. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6443.46s)]
*  So I don't see why it just keeps happening. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6446.820000000001s)]
*  And yeah, if you're good at your job of being a congressman or a senator, [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6450.34s)]
*  are they different ones? Yeah. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6454.22s)]
*  Yeah. Then afterwards, you could do a tour at all the donut shops. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6455.18s)]
*  You show up over there. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6458.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah. People pay you in a heartbeat to show up there, take photos and stuff. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6459.9400000000005s)]
*  Have a get a hug or something. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6463.54s)]
*  Get a get a glazed. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6465.3s)]
*  Just the one thing they shouldn't do is start a podcast. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6468.5s)]
*  Politicians podcasts are terrible. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6470.46s)]
*  Yeah. They're like so boring. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6472.14s)]
*  Newsom tried it. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6473.66s)]
*  Yeah. And I mean, it's just kind of because it's like so stilted and it's not [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6474.740000000001s)]
*  there's no humor. You got to have some humor like, you know, the politician [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6478.86s)]
*  by the straight guy, you need someone who's funny. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6481.86s)]
*  You need like this conversation. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6483.94s)]
*  It's kind of all over the place. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6485.42s)]
*  It's not it's not like, oh, wow, what are the poll numbers on this? [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6487.179999999999s)]
*  And so it's just I've never seen a politician who had a good, interesting podcast. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6491.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think that that would be a bit much maybe, but I don't know shit. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6495.259999999999s)]
*  I mean, anybody could do it. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6498.299999999999s)]
*  It's hard for saying shit right in front of you, sir. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6499.46s)]
*  Oh, no, no, it's all. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6501.099999999999s)]
*  Well, I should have done better. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6502.0599999999995s)]
*  No, not at all. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6503.78s)]
*  Oh, I did have this question, though. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6505.099999999999s)]
*  We're talking about that. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6506.94s)]
*  You voted in the past about finances. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6508.3s)]
*  You voted in the past to ban members of Congress from trading and holding [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6510.900000000001s)]
*  individual stocks. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6513.9800000000005s)]
*  This hasn't happened yet, right? [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6515.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. Why do you think that hasn't happened? [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6517.900000000001s)]
*  You know, like if Martha Stewart went to prison, then Nancy Pelosi should go to prison. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6520.3s)]
*  It feels like, you know. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6524.38s)]
*  Well, I don't think that Pelosi, in my view, I mean, this has done [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6525.74s)]
*  things that are unethical, but I think that there is this such a trust deficit [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6530.74s)]
*  in the Congress that people think that the biggest problem is money in politics, right? [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6535.820000000001s)]
*  They're taking all this money from PACs. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6540.38s)]
*  They're taking all this money from lobbyists. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6542.900000000001s)]
*  But at the same time, people are concerned if members of Congress are individually [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6544.820000000001s)]
*  trading stock. And so the bill I've supported calling for a ban on stock trading [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6549.740000000001s)]
*  is a no trust act. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6553.700000000001s)]
*  And it says, you know, put your money in a trust, have someone else manage it. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6554.9800000000005s)]
*  Don't be there trading stocks or telling your advisor to trade stocks [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6558.900000000001s)]
*  while you're creating a conflict. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6564.58s)]
*  And why have you gotten a vote? [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6566.9400000000005s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6570.3s)]
*  Something Johnson can Johnson can get us a vote on. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6571.46s)]
*  I think it would pass overwhelmingly. [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6574.78s)]
*  And we've got a bipartisan group that's pushing for a vote on that. [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6576.7s)]
*  But if you do the five parts of my political reform plan, ban PAC money, [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6580.42s)]
*  ban super PACs, ban lobbyists from getting money, ban members of Congress [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6586.18s)]
*  from ever becoming a lobbyist and ban stock trading in Congress, [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6590.7s)]
*  I think you would start to restore trust in Congress. [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6594.82s)]
*  And some of the mega folks actually have liked the plan the most. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6598.46s)]
*  I had a drain the swamp act, which I said, you want to drain the swamp. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6601.46s)]
*  How about just telling lobbyists they can't give gifts to White House officials? [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6604.74s)]
*  And someone's like, oh, you only want to apply for Donald Trump. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6608.34s)]
*  No, I was like, I wanted to apply, whether it's Donald Trump or a Democratic president. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6610.66s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, yeah. [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6614.82s)]
*  I mean, all the things you're saying seem very [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6616.54s)]
*  like I think these are things that are super important. [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6621.099999999999s)]
*  I feel like it's things that most people feel are super important. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6623.54s)]
*  And that's but but it never what happens. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6626.3s)]
*  It's like it's just like we talk about these things. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6628.26s)]
*  Everybody's like, yeah. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6631.58s)]
*  And then it gets to someplace where it all nothing ever really evolves. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6632.58s)]
*  It feels like and that's where I feel like right now. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6636.5s)]
*  Instead, Hollywood gives us like, here's a ditty case. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6638.22s)]
*  Go, you know, keep the black population at ease. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6641.099999999999s)]
*  You know, like, here's a, [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6644.0599999999995s)]
*  you know, we'll stretch the NBA finals another week. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6647.74s)]
*  We'll send in a special ref that are you for the Pacers? [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6650.14s)]
*  Allegedly, I'm for the Pacers. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6652.5s)]
*  I like Halliburton. I think he's just a super guy. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6654.620000000001s)]
*  But but or yeah, I know it just it feels like it never gets there. [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6656.620000000001s)]
*  You had you see my producer also. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6662.18s)]
*  You have a but your family owns stock or you have stock in your family [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6665.18s)]
*  before you got married. Yeah. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6669.18s)]
*  How does how would that relate into a congressman or Senator owning? [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6670.9800000000005s)]
*  Well, under the under the trust act, [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6676.860000000001s)]
*  people can members of Congress and they can be in a trust. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6679.02s)]
*  They just can't trade stock. [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6682.900000000001s)]
*  OK, and trade stock. And that I think that that's why I sponsored the bill. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6684.740000000001s)]
*  I think that we what we want to do is eliminate conflicts. [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6688.22s)]
*  And if you can have the no trust act happen, it says [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6692.9800000000005s)]
*  members of Congress cannot trade stock. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6698.540000000001s)]
*  If there are any assets, they put them in a trust [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6701.42s)]
*  and that would eliminate conflicts. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6704.5s)]
*  But what is upsetting to people is people making trades [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6705.94s)]
*  while they're doing policy. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6711.0599999999995s)]
*  And that's where the conflict is. [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6713.219999999999s)]
*  The federal employees currently aren't allowed to do that. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6714.5s)]
*  They have to have their money in in some trust. [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6716.94s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, because it would almost be in they ethically. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6719.9s)]
*  It doesn't make sense. But it would be hard not to. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6723.46s)]
*  You're in a meeting and you're hearing about this or that to get on your phone [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6725.0199999999995s)]
*  and get on your app and and make a trade. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6727.94s)]
*  You know, heck, if I'm watching a sports center highlight or something [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6730.54s)]
*  and I see like one of the players has a call for some I'm betting [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6733.299999999999s)]
*  against that team the next night. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6735.66s)]
*  You know, like if you know, if I see Walker Bueller's, [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6736.86s)]
*  you know, if he seems like he's angry about something the next day, I'm going to [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6740.26s)]
*  I'll probably bet he has a few more strikeouts. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6743.22s)]
*  Well, look, I think the honest truth is there are not many Pete [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6744.94s)]
*  roses in the Congress. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6747.58s)]
*  There are not many people, honestly, who are out there [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6748.66s)]
*  trading on information. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6753.5s)]
*  You know, all my parties, for example, gone after Marjorie Taylor Green. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6754.98s)]
*  And she says that she's got an independent advisor is making the phrase. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6758.26s)]
*  I actually believe her. I believe her. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6761.42s)]
*  But the problem is that the the the perception [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6763.06s)]
*  that has been created is that people are benefiting from this. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6766.18s)]
*  So just pass the No Trust Act. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6771.18s)]
*  It's got bipartisan support people. [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6773.5s)]
*  If they have assets, they can put them in a in a trust. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6775.9800000000005s)]
*  They can have it independently managed. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6779.540000000001s)]
*  Then, you know, that they're not sitting there making trades [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6781.06s)]
*  or telling people what to do. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6784.700000000001s)]
*  Can they legally advise the trust advisor? [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6786.38s)]
*  I mean, when they know that they can't in day to day trading, [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6788.9800000000005s)]
*  they can't they can they can set it up, but they can't tell the trust advisor. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6792.5s)]
*  OK, trade here, trade there. [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6796.7s)]
*  And it has to be all disclosed. [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6798.86s)]
*  And that that would assure the American people that you don't have people out there [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6800.62s)]
*  trading on stocks in a way that is that they can't. Yeah. [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6805.78s)]
*  You know, the craziest thing is, I just thought sometimes [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6810.7s)]
*  one of the benefits of the surveillance system would be that finally we get to see [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6813.46s)]
*  what all these senators and congresspeople and everybody's up to, you know. Right. [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6817.42s)]
*  I wish you could just tell us like, [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6821.26s)]
*  do I wish you had a breathalyzer for if people were being honest or not. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6823.62s)]

*  There you go. [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6831.14s)]

*  Maybe I'm have to like do a lie detector. [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6836.1s)]
*  Take that back to Silicon Valley with you. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6838.02s)]
*  Ro Khanna. That's your name. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6840.820000000001s)]

*  I went to Madras one time and had a really great time. [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6847.66s)]
*  Really loved it. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6850.299999999999s)]

*  I know we've been on the air for a couple of hours. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw&t=6864.0599999999995s)]
