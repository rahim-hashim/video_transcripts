*  Like I didn't plan it this way, but, um, my special was supposed to come out in March. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=98.76s)]
*  I shot it in November and I don't know about you, but like, I can't watch myself ever. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=103.4s)]
*  I hate looking at myself. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=109.36s)]
*  So the editing process was so tedious and I put it off so much that it had to be pushed [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=110.44s)]
*  to July because I couldn't get it edited in time because I couldn't watch myself. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=116.28s)]
*  I literally was like frozen. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=120.08s)]
*  Have you ever felt that way about watching your standup? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=122.0s)]
*  Yeah, I always, I mean, I feel sometimes like I don't, it's just such a tough way [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=125.56s)]
*  to capture standup and to try and get it right in a, like in a, or just get the [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=131.32s)]
*  exact thing you want in a night. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=137.8s)]
*  Um, even though you get two chances for some reason, I make the state same mistakes [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=139.8s)]
*  twice and you go, why couldn't I just have done it the way I always do it? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=144.23999999999998s)]
*  It's like, it's, um, I never, but I never listened to myself and I never watched [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=149.11999999999998s)]
*  myself after that's why I like stand up. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=153.51999999999998s)]
*  You just do it. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=155.51999999999998s)]
*  And then you like, it was live. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=156.0s)]
*  If anyone like calls you on like, Oh, this thing you did wasn't good. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=158.32s)]
*  You can go, well, in my head it was good. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=161.76s)]
*  There's no proof of like, you can't analyze it. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=163.35999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=167.2s)]
*  I get, Oh, I think there's, I think there's, well, that's something that's, I felt [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=167.72s)]
*  like was always nice about everything, you know, like you used to never be able [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=173.24s)]
*  to analyze everything. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=180.52s)]
*  It was like, you know, I think about this sometimes, like a moment used to have so [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=181.56s)]
*  much value, like there's no real, like a moment feels like it doesn't have value [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=185.64000000000001s)]
*  anymore, like a real moment because like, if it's not captured, it, it started to [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=192.12s)]
*  feel like, Hey, don't capture this. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=197.36s)]
*  It used to be like, Hey, don't capture this. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=199.96s)]
*  This is important. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=202.28s)]
*  This is like, you know, and the cameras away. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=203.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=206.36s)]
*  And now it's like, Hey, let's not have this conversation until we get rolling. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=206.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=209.64000000000001s)]
*  Like we just sat in silence here. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=210.44s)]
*  Like we didn't want to have any kind of any friendship and no, there was like a, a, a [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=212.24s)]
*  nice greeting. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=216.60000000000002s)]
*  And then it was like, let's just save it. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=217.28s)]
*  But there's something nice about that because we want to be, we want it to be [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=219.32s)]
*  genuine and we want people to see like what is really going on. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=222.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=225.56s)]
*  Like us, we want to save our, our actual energy so people can see, okay, this is [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=225.84s)]
*  when they really started talking. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=230.72s)]
*  Cause you and I didn't talk about, I stood up, I gave you a hug. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=231.88000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=234.32000000000002s)]
*  You sat down and then we waited. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=234.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=237.12s)]
*  And then we waited. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=237.8s)]
*  It's like, we wait until, okay. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=238.76000000000002s)]
*  Is it like a meditation kind of for however, like it was like a minute, really kind of [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=240.92000000000002s)]
*  just, yeah. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=245.60000000000002s)]
*  Cause on the way over, I was planning on doing a meditation. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=246.8s)]
*  Then I get lost in my phone. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=249.12s)]
*  And so I had a couple seconds while the TVs were being set, everything was set up. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=250.84s)]
*  And I just was like, just focus on your breathing. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=254.76s)]
*  I did with my eyes open, obviously, cause that would be weird, but do that hard [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=257.32s)]
*  kegel baby, push them fricking just tense up everything. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=260.59999999999997s)]
*  Like, yeah, like just, I don't, I don't know what I did, but I just centered [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=263.96s)]
*  myself and I was just like, whatever happens happens and don't regret anything [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=267.8s)]
*  you say it happened for a reason. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=272.36s)]
*  Anything you don't say it was meant to not be said all that bullshit. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=274.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=279.48s)]
*  It gets scary. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=279.76s)]
*  I used to feel less scary about podcasting. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=280.24s)]
*  And then I think I started to just get in my head so much. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=282.28s)]
*  Me too. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=284.55999999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=285.35999999999996s)]
*  Why we should be more free. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=286.47999999999996s)]
*  I know. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=289.71999999999997s)]
*  Cause we have more people watching. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=290.11999999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=292.32s)]
*  You know, I don't know what it is. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=292.52s)]
*  I think some, yeah, some of it probably became that some of it could have been ego [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=293.59999999999997s)]
*  for me, I don't, or fear, you know, cause I think ego is really, ego is just like [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=296.79999999999995s)]
*  fear in like a nice cape with a comb. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=302.91999999999996s)]

*  Like what's your fear with podcasting? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=310.0s)]
*  If you could kind of pinpoint what's the, what's the thing you have now? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=312.2s)]

*  and you're afraid they're going to leave, you know, or they're going to look [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=332.32s)]
*  closely and go, Oh wait, this is not what I thought it was. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=335.52000000000004s)]

*  Oh yeah, dude. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=348.0s)]
*  I used to do a ton of loitering. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=348.64000000000004s)]
*  That was a big thing in our area because they didn't have a lot to do. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=349.8s)]
*  So those signs were directed at you. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=354.16s)]
*  Cause I was wondering who's just loitering. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=355.88s)]
*  Like what does it even mean? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=357.88s)]
*  Soliciting, loitering those signs. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=359.0s)]

*  What did we do? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=394.84s)]
*  I know that's like a very cliche question nowadays, but what did we do? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=395.79999999999995s)]
*  When we were waiting for something. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=400.91999999999996s)]
*  Well, you know, it's interesting because I'll notice sometime I'll have feelings. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=403.44s)]
*  Like if I go eat by myself, sometimes I'll leave my phone in the car now. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=406.24s)]

*  what do you do? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=426.28000000000003s)]
*  Well, here's the part that feels crazy. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=427.12s)]
*  The crazy part is when you think, okay, if other people look over here and I'm [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=429.6s)]
*  just thinking or looking into space, I now seem like a, like a crazy person. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=436.20000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=443.88s)]
*  I seem like someone, oh, that guy's not, that guy's not doing well. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=444.36s)]
*  That guy is just got kicked out of the church. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=447.96000000000004s)]
*  It's that kind of look, you know, like, oh, why would a man be eating by himself [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=450.52s)]
*  with no phone, with no phone, unless he was, um, unless he didn't know about [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=455.03999999999996s)]
*  phones or he lost someone he wasn't, you know, he couldn't fiscally afford to [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=461.32s)]
*  keep his phone and yeah, but you're nicely dressed too, which is confusing as [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=466.47999999999996s)]
*  well, because no phone should match a different look. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=469.88s)]
*  And that's where then I think people go, oh, he was with the church. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=472.44s)]
*  He got let go and he's sitting here in shame or just got out prison. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=474.84s)]
*  Yeah, maybe I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't think I have that look, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=480.56s)]
*  no, but you feel that's when I noticed I'm like, oh my God, if I sit here, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=485.76s)]
*  what is the feeling? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=490.84s)]
*  Is it a feeling that I'm missing out or that, um, no, it's that that [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=491.76s)]
*  doesn't feel normal anymore. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=497.71999999999997s)]
*  No. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=499.52s)]
*  And that used to feel real normal. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=499.79999999999995s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=501.64s)]
*  You know, the Chinese pull this up, Zachary, the Chinese, um, if you take [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=502.76s)]
*  their picture, they get angry at you. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=508.64s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=511.15999999999997s)]
*  Like just like a stranger? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=511.59999999999997s)]
*  No, something more like do China want us taking their picture? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=515.1999999999999s)]
*  Do China? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=519.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=521.52s)]

*  There we go. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=522.76s)]
*  Like getting their picture taken. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=523.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=525.08s)]
*  Let's fucking be realistic. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=525.28s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=528.4s)]
*  Well, I understand not wanting your picture taken if you don't know it. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=530.76s)]
*  I used to do that on, on the subway. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=534.3199999999999s)]
*  Oh, that's interesting. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=536.64s)]
*  And then why do Chinese people take photos? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=537.44s)]
*  Everything. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=539.0400000000001s)]
*  I remember just being in China. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=539.6s)]
*  I wonder if maybe it was Malaysia and we try to take a picture of some. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=541.84s)]
*  And they said, no. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=545.9200000000001s)]
*  And I remember our teachers would teach us that they don't like their picture [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=547.2s)]
*  taken as it captures the soul who believes that picture taken captures the soul. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=550.1600000000001s)]
*  Maybe there you go. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=555.2800000000001s)]
*  That's that's the good. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=556.0400000000001s)]
*  Who believes pictures captures. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=558.6800000000001s)]
*  My ends. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=564.5200000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=565.6s)]
*  That's kind of close to Malaysian, but not. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=567.0s)]
*  But do you feel like over time? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=570.7199999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=572.3199999999999s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=573.24s)]
*  And the Mayans, who knows what they were. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=574.04s)]
*  You ever see, do you ever see a picture of yourself where you don't know it's [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=575.8399999999999s)]
*  being taken and you have just a look where you're like, Whoa, I that my soul is [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=578.3199999999999s)]
*  in that where you just have like a dead look that just a moment that captures [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=582.24s)]
*  like really what you're feeling in that moment. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=586.4399999999999s)]
*  Like you just, you don't know, like where it's just, I think we have these things. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=589.64s)]
*  I've learned about it in some class. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=594.04s)]
*  I took once where I was paying attention and you have flashes. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=595.6s)]
*  We as humans need to communicate in there like micro seconds long, but it will show [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=600.0s)]
*  I could be like smiling in such a good mood. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=604.28s)]
*  And if I'm in a bad mood, you for a flash, you'll see my real truth of like [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=606.0400000000001s)]
*  discomfort or anger, whatever it is. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=610.48s)]
*  And it's just a quick flash, but it's enough to send the person that you're [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=613.0s)]
*  talking to the message without them actually knowing that you did it. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=615.76s)]
*  And sometimes those pictures catch that, but mine's usually just like a dead [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=619.5600000000001s)]
*  stare, just like, yeah, just kind of sad, kind of a sadness. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=623.2800000000001s)]

*  Oh yeah. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=631.9200000000001s)]
*  I spent too much time getting sad. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=632.48s)]
*  I realized, I realized I was getting sad and then I was, uh, getting stuck in my [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=633.9200000000001s)]
*  own sadness, you know, I was like, why am I sad? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=640.9200000000001s)]
*  I was asking that too much instead of just doing things to not be sad. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=643.84s)]
*  Man, I was just about to ask you what makes you sad. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=647.72s)]
*  So I don't know if you want to answer that, but like you've got given a lot of [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=649.5200000000001s)]
*  thought, like what's something that'll go trigger it and go spiral. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=651.84s)]
*  We see something loneliness. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=657.0400000000001s)]
*  I think probably, uh, getting older, sometimes seeing people with families. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=659.6s)]
*  If I don't have a fam, that kind of stuff sometimes will get me, you know, like, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=665.2s)]
*  uh, but then you really like kind of look at it, you know, and you're like, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=668.8000000000001s)]

*  Like I do not want little Jonathan, you know? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=675.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=677.2s)]
*  Um, yeah. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=678.4000000000001s)]
*  But I do think it's interesting how it's like almost that we, like even friendships [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=679.44s)]
*  now it's like recorded and put out people. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=686.2s)]
*  It's like, I wonder if in like 20 years, people will listen back and like, Oh, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=688.48s)]
*  listen to these friendships on tape. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=692.4000000000001s)]
*  You know, it'll be like, Oh wow. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=694.44s)]
*  Let's go listen to some friendships like, or like human, like if, if, if it [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=697.48s)]
*  gets to the point where humans don't interact anymore, what does it sound [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=702.32s)]
*  like when they used to talk to each other? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=706.8000000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=708.08s)]
*  Or what is it like, um, Oh, what about a hug? [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=708.64s)]
*  Let's go look at some old videos of people hugging, you know, or somebody [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=711.28s)]
*  tickling somebody, you know? [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=716.0s)]

*  I don't mind it, dude. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=721.0s)]
*  But when I was growing up, they had a, I miss tickling. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=721.96s)]
*  Tickling was such a part of childhood getting pinned down. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=725.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=729.24s)]
*  I used to love doing it. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=729.96s)]
*  I used to love, like there's something about it's the, it's the worst feeling [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=731.16s)]
*  in the world and a lot of the porn. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=734.72s)]
*  Sometimes when I'm watching porn, there'll be like tickling videos [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=736.1999999999999s)]
*  and I have no interest in that. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=738.8s)]
*  It's not like a sexual thing, but I guess it's a whole genre of porn. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=739.9599999999999s)]
*  Oh, the tickling stuff. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=743.7199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=745.0s)]
*  It relates like just people tied up being like laughing girls. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=745.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=749.9599999999999s)]
*  I hate it. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=750.12s)]
*  What now? [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=750.56s)]
*  What do you think you, um, what do you think you don't like about tickling? [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=750.8s)]
*  I mean, I used to love it as a kid because I think it was probably just like touch. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=754.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=758.6s)]
*  Like it was just like, I don't think I got enough as a kid. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=759.04s)]
*  I really did. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=761.76s)]
*  Uh, my mom hates when I say this on things, but I just don't think I got enough. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=763.08s)]
*  Human touch. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=768.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=769.52s)]
*  So I think I liked when me and my cousins or me and my sister would tickle. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=769.8s)]
*  I would used to love to like wrestle. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=773.68s)]
*  I just wanted like to be touched and like someone trying to get me. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=775.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=778.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=778.8s)]
*  Tickling felt like somebody I think was going to be able to like, uh, I think it [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=779.04s)]
*  started to feel like, when does it end? [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=783.56s)]
*  It's almost too much. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=785.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=786.92s)]
*  It's too, it feels too exciting. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=787.56s)]
*  There's a mix of like, it feels too exciting. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=789.88s)]
*  I'm going to shit. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=792.4799999999999s)]
*  I think there's a little bit of that. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=793.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=794.56s)]
*  You might like fart. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=794.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=796.0s)]
*  Something like that. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=796.3199999999999s)]
*  Like somebody's going to get the truth out of me. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=797.0799999999999s)]
*  Like, oh yeah. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=798.8s)]
*  A sound or something is going to come out of me. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=799.88s)]
*  Laugh. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=801.76s)]
*  Why do we laugh with tickling? [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=802.36s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=803.9599999999999s)]
*  It's so weird. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=804.68s)]
*  I think I, it's that a sound's going to come out of me that I don't want someone [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=806.8399999999999s)]
*  to hear that I didn't create so vulnerable. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=811.5999999999999s)]
*  You're just like, that's really vulnerable. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=813.8399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=817.0799999999999s)]
*  It, I do compare it though to, I always used to say that tickling was like [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=817.84s)]
*  masturbation in the sense that if someone else does it to me, I'm laughing. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=822.52s)]
*  I can't, I can't control it. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=825.6s)]
*  But if I do it to myself, really, I feel stupid. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=826.64s)]
*  I'm just like, I see it coming. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=829.4s)]
*  I think part of sex is like, or part of being turned on or is the unexpected. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=831.16s)]
*  Ooh. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=837.4s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=838.1999999999999s)]
*  So I, I, now I don't struggle with it as much, but like, I never really [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=838.84s)]
*  understood why people, how people could masturbate and not see it coming in, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=842.52s)]
*  in the same way that like, this doesn't do anything to me. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=846.76s)]
*  But if anyone were to do this to me, I'd be like, like, it would, how is [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=848.8s)]
*  that because I can predict it. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=852.68s)]
*  So masturbation I'm like, I can't, I know what's going to happen here. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=854.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=857.92s)]
*  Masturbation gets kind of, uh, masturbation really runs its course. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=858.2s)]
*  You know, I met this gal one time at a library and she had, she didn't have [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=862.36s)]
*  any fingers on one of her hands. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=866.2s)]
*  She had like a, um, I don't know what it was called. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=867.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=873.4s)]
*  But it was more than that. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=873.96s)]
*  When you do a crab legs and you get all the, you take all the legs off the crabs [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=875.0s)]
*  and it's almost like a little, just like the hand meaty part. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=879.56s)]
*  It was like that thing that Thor has now. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=883.08s)]
*  I just saw it the other day. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=884.68s)]
*  What is it? [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=886.48s)]
*  I just saw the movie though. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=887.08s)]
*  That super hammer. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=887.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=889.64s)]
*  This gal had a real super hammer on her and bring up Tom Dempsey too, if you can [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=889.84s)]
*  bring him up, he's a famous guy. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=894.44s)]
*  What is, what does this have to do with masturbation? [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=896.48s)]
*  Well, so I remember I met this guy at the library and then we wanted to get together. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=899.24s)]
*  Bring him up. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=903.64s)]
*  There you go. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=904.12s)]
*  You met a girl at the library. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=904.52s)]
*  When is this video? [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=905.96s)]
*  This was nine years ago. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=907.4399999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=908.76s)]
*  I love it. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=911.0799999999999s)]
*  It's not 10, but that's Tom Dempsey right there. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=911.64s)]
*  So he's got that fricking hammer. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=915.0s)]
*  Look at that claw hammer. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=916.48s)]
*  Zoom in on that hoof, baby. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=918.28s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=919.72s)]
*  He died, unfortunately. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=922.48s)]
*  And he had to, he had a 73 yarder. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=925.12s)]
*  Okay. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=927.24s)]
*  I know he died at 73. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=927.92s)]
*  So you met this girl at the library nine years ago. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=929.1999999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=931.72s)]
*  And I remember she would like kind of like, and we got involved in sex, right? [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=931.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=935.5600000000001s)]
*  And so she would like, kind of like, how do you pick up a girl at the library? [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=936.0400000000001s)]
*  How do you pick up a girl anywhere and then get involved in sex? [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=942.24s)]
*  I really don't understand this. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=944.48s)]
*  You just have a vibe. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=946.48s)]
*  Did you know right away, like this is happening? [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=947.36s)]
*  No, I sat down and she was kind of cute and we were talking. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=950.8000000000001s)]
*  We both were in the library. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=954.1600000000001s)]
*  So right there, you know, things probably weren't going great at the overall, I [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=955.88s)]
*  think if you're at the during, you know, at that time, you know, the library hasn't [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=961.72s)]
*  been like a real hot bed of. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=964.72s)]
*  That's why I asked the timeline. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=966.48s)]
*  Cause I go nine years ago. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=968.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=970.6s)]
*  Even then. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=971.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=972.24s)]
*  It was, there's phones around. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=972.84s)]
*  And especially even in Los Angeles, man, a lot of the library out here is just a [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=974.44s)]
*  lot of people, I mean, we saw a dude try to climb into a fucking book. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=978.08s)]
*  This fucking homeless dude tried to get into one of those big Atlas's, you know, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=981.4s)]
*  trying to take a vacation the long way, you know, but, uh, she was, she would [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=985.76s)]
*  like play with herself kind of. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=990.32s)]
*  I remember this girl would like kind of play with herself with her. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=991.88s)]
*  And she had a stump with her, uh, unlimited hand. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=994.4000000000001s)]
*  She would kind of play with herself and then she would kind of, this is, she [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=997.9200000000001s)]
*  would kind of like beat this, like beat the top of her uvula or whatever it's [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=1002.9200000000001s)]
*  called, she would like hit it with the club with the, it was almost like a [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=1009.2s)]
*  damn like treble and bass, you know, it was like, she was like remixing her own [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=1013.2s)]
*  puss kind of, it was, I mean, I don't know. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=1016.88s)]
*  I don't know what happened. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=1020.96s)]
*  Oh, and then I remember it was like, it was a, it, you know, a lot of women, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=1022.1600000000001s)]
*  sometimes some women will have, it just, it had a very, uh, violent odor to her [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=1030.44s)]
*  vagina every time she'd hit it with that hammer, it would just, I knew another [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=1039.6000000000001s)]
*  like, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=1044.3600000000001s)]
*  Wafting. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=1045.8400000000001s)]
*  Oh, I knew it was going to be a lot of, you know, my toes would just curl up [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=1046.56s)]
*  and I was like, I can't be, I can't be a part of this. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=1051.6399999999999s)]
*  So was this something, was this a one time thing or was it a repeat thing? [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=1053.8799999999999s)]
*  And you noticed that this odor was not getting remedied. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=1057.08s)]
*  Um, I can't remember if it was one time or two times, but it, we ended up [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=1060.32s)]
*  separating, right. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=1064.76s)]
*  Because of the odor, you think it was just a lot, it was a lot of stuff. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=1066.32s)]
*  I think we didn't really get along that great and we barely even knew each other. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=1069.24s)]
*  I mean, we literally met at the library and then we're, you know, trying to get [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=1071.96s)]
*  involved sexually. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=1075.64s)]

*  this thing to a family member of my boyfriend or like they'd be ashamed. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=1782.1599999999999s)]

*  dominated and being told like, you little pussy bitch, get your fucking stupid [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=1884.24s)]

*  You know, get your dick back out there at work. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=1895.24s)]
*  Yeah, I don't, I relate to like, I like the, I like the other side. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=1899.76s)]
*  Like I enjoy, I don't like being made fun of in bed or sexually or called like [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=1903.1200000000001s)]
*  you're an ugly, like anything mean about me, but I like being dominated or being [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=1909.88s)]
*  told, like, um, just feeling like powerless a little bit. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=1915.2800000000002s)]
*  So I get, I get what these guys want, but I, that's not, it's the opposite. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=1918.3600000000001s)]
*  I'm the opposite on stage of what I would want in a relationship. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=1923.68s)]
*  So anyone that's like, I'm really horny for like, I watch your standup [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=1926.0s)]
*  and I'm just like, God, she's so fucking hot. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=1929.48s)]
*  I'm just like, it would never work between us. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=1931.4s)]
*  But you've been, I'm sure you've hooked up with some fans though. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=1934.08s)]
*  Huh? [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=1938.0s)]
*  No, never. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=1938.16s)]
*  No, no, never. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=1939.68s)]
*  I really haven't. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=1941.04s)]
*  I just don't, I'm not, I just feel like I, it's not that I'm not honest up there [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=1942.16s)]
*  and it's not exactly what I want to say and what I want to do, but I feel like [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=1947.04s)]
*  in a relationship, I just want to be, or in a sexual scenario, I don't want to be [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=1950.4s)]
*  in control, I don't want to be in a position of power, I don't want to be the [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=1955.44s)]
*  one talking, I want to be like a quiet hole. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=1958.68s)]
*  Like, I just don't want to, that's a, I do that too. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=1962.52s)]
*  I feel like, because standup is all about control. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=1966.3200000000002s)]
*  We write our own stuff. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=1968.68s)]
*  We're the only ones on stage. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=1969.76s)]
*  We get, we have, we decide what we write. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=1971.1200000000001s)]
*  We, we're the only ones talking. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=1973.88s)]
*  We overpower anyone. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=1975.3600000000001s)]
*  We don't have a band. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=1976.3200000000002s)]
*  There's no collaboration. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=1977.24s)]
*  It's a control thing. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=1979.3200000000002s)]
*  And I think that, I think in sex or in a lot of ways, we just look for ways to get [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=1980.3200000000002s)]
*  out of control because we're like tired of being in control. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=1985.64s)]
*  So that's the last place where I want any control. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=1987.76s)]
*  I don't want to think about anything. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=1990.4s)]
*  It's so nice to not, that's the one time where it's like, even during massages [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=1991.72s)]
*  that I pay for, I feel like still a pressure to like respond to them or like [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=1996.4s)]
*  stay awake or talk to them or like not fall asleep. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2002.76s)]
*  There's always pressure. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2007.6s)]
*  And I feel like in sex, if you're really connected with someone and like have that [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2008.2s)]
*  dynamic, you can, I can really like disappear and not, it's almost like [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2012.36s)]
*  disappearing in a way that's probably not healthy because you're like trying to get [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2016.56s)]
*  out of who you are and like not be in the room. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2019.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2022.24s)]
*  But I think that's so fun to be able to do that and not be like it to get high from [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2022.52s)]
*  sex without drugs or whatever. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2028.04s)]
*  That's, I mean, if I'm not smoking weed and I don't drink anymore, but I go in and [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2029.8s)]
*  out of smoking weed, that's like, that's my high. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2033.84s)]
*  And then I want to do that. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2038.32s)]
*  I mean, I just like fucking switch things. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2039.12s)]
*  I mean, so you're saying like, okay, so you're saying like during, so you like [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2041.8s)]
*  being kind of, uh, you're submissive. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2045.76s)]
*  Okay. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2049.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2049.52s)]
*  So then here's what I think is interesting is I think there's different reasons why [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2049.88s)]
*  men and women then get into probably comedy for women, for men. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2053.12s)]
*  I think the original thing is I want to be seen by women. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2058.44s)]
*  I want to be validated. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2061.36s)]
*  You know, I want, you know, Sarah to look at me or I want Angelica to, you know, see [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2062.72s)]
*  me and think, oh, there's something about him. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2067.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2069.56s)]
*  And it works. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2069.72s)]
*  So for women, then what is that? [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2071.28s)]
*  Cause if y'all aren't out there trying to trap. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2072.8s)]
*  Oh man, I'm trying to get seen, but I'm trying to get seen and, and heard. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2074.84s)]
*  And, um, so for women, it's more of a business almost since I think it's about, I [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2079.44s)]
*  think it's about wanting to be heard and feeling like I just felt like growing up. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2085.2400000000002s)]
*  If I kind of like really pull it apart and figure out why I do it, I think that's [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2089.04s)]
*  like, I felt like a weird kid. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2092.7200000000003s)]
*  I never got to the things I would say would always make people go like, Ew, [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2094.4s)]
*  like what, and like look at each other concerned, want to get me help. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2097.96s)]
*  So I just learned to like not talk. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2101.36s)]
*  And also I thought that if I ever talked, um, boys would call me ugly. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2103.56s)]
*  So if I ever said something, it would make, it would make people look at me [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2108.3599999999997s)]
*  and remember that I existed and then they would call me ugly. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2112.0s)]
*  And then that's like, I mean, because it happened a couple times enough where it [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2115.0s)]
*  was like, okay, I learned my lesson. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2118.7599999999998s)]
*  Like do not talk because the boys that are like, just brazen enough. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2119.9599999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2125.72s)]
*  Just, and the boys that liked me, honestly, I look back and I'm like, they [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2126.0s)]
*  were the ones that called me Ellen when Ellen was like, had just come out and was [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2129.52s)]
*  gay. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2133.24s)]
*  Did you seem like a gay woman? [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2134.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2135.7999999999997s)]
*  Cause I didn't like a lot of gay looking stuff. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2135.9599999999996s)]
*  No, I just didn't like boys. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2138.08s)]
*  I did. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2139.3599999999997s)]
*  I liked boys, but I didn't want to talk to them. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2139.68s)]
*  I didn't want to kiss them. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2141.4799999999996s)]
*  I didn't want to date. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2142.7599999999998s)]
*  I mean, I wanted to, but I didn't know how. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2143.4399999999996s)]
*  And so I just never had boyfriends. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2145.0s)]
*  And so I think that they were just like, Nikki's gay. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2146.9199999999996s)]
*  And so they called me Ellen and, um, and then like, you know, just, but [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2149.3599999999997s)]
*  were you doing hand jobs and stuff? [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2152.9599999999996s)]
*  Were you proving yourself? [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2154.4399999999996s)]
*  No, dude, I didn't do anything. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2155.3599999999997s)]
*  Wow. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2156.7999999999997s)]
*  So you weren't proving that you weren't gay. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2157.08s)]
*  No, I mean, I didn't, I, I definitely didn't think I was cause I [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2159.0s)]
*  love Jonathan Taylor Thomas like a lot. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2162.24s)]
*  And he's almost a woman. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2164.9199999999996s)]
*  Not wrong. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2167.7599999999998s)]
*  Zach, I mean, they're handsome guys, but they're, you know, no, when I get to [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2168.3199999999997s)]
*  that, you know, was my first, like, I would say the, my most recent that I was [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2171.9599999999996s)]
*  just like, Jesus Christ. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2176.2799999999997s)]
*  And I looked at his face when I'm like, he has a woman's face. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2177.3599999999997s)]
*  Like he's a really pretty guy. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2180.24s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2182.12s)]
*  Like I definitely somewhere on the spectrum, but no, I like dudes and I, but [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2182.64s)]
*  I was too scared of them because I just, I thought it would be bad at things. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2187.9199999999996s)]
*  That's why I'm so interested in like, how do you make a first move? [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2190.84s)]

*  the guy and not because I was like lazy, but because I didn't want to like be bad [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2267.96s)]

*  They send the kids out of the room so that they can talk about it. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2423.52s)]

*  we got to get this clown. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2969.36s)]
*  Yeah. And time was ticking. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2971.76s)]
*  It was getting later in the day like there was a pony. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2973.32s)]
*  There was a pony. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2975.32s)]
*  So like we got to sneak off and get this BJ in somewhere around here. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2977.4s)]
*  And so we snuck off behind this tree and it was like [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2981.08s)]
*  they don't really have the trees wide enough to get a BJ behind them where I'm from. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2985.84s)]
*  You know, without somebody seeing somebody in birches. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2989.92s)]
*  Yeah, it's a lot more. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2993.28s)]
*  What's the thickest tree in Louisiana? [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2994.52s)]
*  You think, Zach, if you pull something up like that? [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=2996.1200000000003s)]
*  Because you can really get blown behind one of these. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3002.2400000000002s)]
*  OK, you know. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3004.84s)]
*  No, yeah, search only for thickest that taxodium distictum, huh? [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3007.84s)]
*  Fifteen point nine. Oh, what is that meter? [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3012.76s)]
*  It's girth. Yeah. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3014.84s)]
*  Yes, by Garth, we're talking meters here. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3016.6800000000003s)]
*  Assume diameter. Mm hmm. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3019.84s)]
*  So well, I guess these people couldn't afford one of those. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3022.2000000000003s)]
*  So because that's really wide enough almost, especially at that age. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3026.44s)]
*  In California, got the redwoods. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3029.36s)]
*  You can fucking have an orgy behind one of those. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3030.88s)]
*  Oh, you can build a car max behind one of them. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3036.04s)]
*  But anyway, I couldn't. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3040.7200000000003s)]
*  And and the kids mom came over. Oh, shit. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3041.6800000000003s)]
*  It was like, y'all are blowjobbing. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3045.4s)]
*  And I was like, I'm not, you know, [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3047.04s)]
*  and then the girl felt bad when I said, I'm not. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3049.68s)]
*  Oh, and then I felt bad because I was like, it was her idea. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3052.68s)]
*  No, I wasn't. She was doing it. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3057.68s)]
*  You know. Oh, right. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3059.44s)]
*  They're blowjobbing. They're blowjobbing. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3060.7999999999997s)]
*  I'm not. I'm just standing here. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3062.72s)]
*  She came up. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3064.7599999999998s)]
*  And she came up. I was just trying to get some air. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3066.2s)]
*  So she came up like, yeah, like, yeah, like. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3069.56s)]
*  Like my penis was just wandering around the air. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3075.64s)]
*  You can't get you. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3078.32s)]
*  So when was your first complete? [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3079.6400000000003s)]
*  Like you're getting well. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3081.96s)]
*  So then we got busted and that was a bad issue. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3083.56s)]
*  And then probably about. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3086.92s)]
*  I think it was a couple of years later. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3090.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. A girl gave me a hand job into a [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3092.88s)]
*  small waterway and. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3097.4s)]
*  And I like a stream. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3101.52s)]
*  Everything is outdoors for you guys. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3103.04s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3106.52s)]
*  I think of the people I knew didn't have big indoors. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3108.0s)]
*  Yeah. So it was like if there's not a lot of room indoors, you got to. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3110.52s)]
*  So in a small waterway, you were like looking over a small, a bobbling brook. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3113.2799999999997s)]
*  No, it was it was larger than that. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3118.68s)]
*  I mean, you could catch something out of it. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3120.8399999999997s)]
*  All right. And so you got a hand job out of that into the stream, into the stream. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3122.16s)]
*  And I remember just being so scared. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3127.16s)]
*  You know, it scared me. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3129.24s)]
*  What scared you about it? [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3130.9599999999996s)]
*  Because I would never be able to get that semen back first. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3131.48s)]
*  No, really? I think it was something about that. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3133.56s)]
*  But hadn't you ejaculated before and felt the same way? [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3135.12s)]
*  Or did you try to put it back in then? [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3137.52s)]
*  Like, well, my armor, we jerked off one time and my dad made us bury it out in the yard. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3139.24s)]
*  No way. What? [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3143.96s)]
*  Yeah. Wait, he caught you jerking off and he's bury your semen in the backyard. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3146.12s)]
*  So you in your hand? [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3153.16s)]
*  Not even in the back. It was in the side yard. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3154.24s)]
*  We that is why. Why? [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3156.96s)]
*  I don't know. He said that's God's and that's where it goes. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3161.08s)]

*  Like a little Randall over there. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3384.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, that's like that guy's over there. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3385.92s)]
*  I can eat chia seeds out of his belly, but not they come up. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3389.28s)]
*  As some fucking hill. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3393.6s)]
*  You know, but we used to. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3395.36s)]
*  I'm sure within within reason, you used to just like have sex with everyone [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3398.0s)]
*  because you got to make a lot of babies for the fucking totally. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3401.0s)]
*  You had to get more goods to be able to survive the winter. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3403.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, because and babies don't live. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3406.7200000000003s)]
*  So everyone was fucking everyone. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3408.2000000000003s)]
*  So your body, when you come as a man, your subconscious, [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3409.36s)]
*  like your caveman brain, whatever it is, is telling you, don't [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3413.4399999999996s)]
*  do not come with this girl again. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3417.64s)]
*  Like you already got her. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3419.3999999999996s)]
*  If she's going to get pregnant, that's the you've already done it. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3421.0s)]
*  Don't drop a second load in this woman, because that would be a waste of your sperm. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3423.9199999999996s)]
*  So don't that's why men afterwards have this like, you know, [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3428.6s)]
*  flight response of like get away, because it would be a waste for you [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3433.7599999999998s)]
*  to fuck someone twice within the same like ovulation period. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3437.7599999999998s)]
*  And that's this whole book was about like not making it so like [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3441.8s)]
*  if you want to keep a guy interested in you, just don't let him come. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3446.76s)]
*  Wow. Ever. And they'll be obsessed with you. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3450.2000000000003s)]
*  And there is some truth to that. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3452.8s)]
*  I mean, like even I feel that way in in relationships. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3453.88s)]
*  I'm I'm scared of come now because I've on the other side of it. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3458.0s)]
*  When a guy comes there, even if they're like my partner at the time, [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3460.96s)]
*  there's just a lack of interest in me. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3465.44s)]
*  That was like they were pawing on me before. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3467.44s)]
*  So into me. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3469.64s)]
*  And then afterwards, it's as we all feel after we are satiated. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3470.56s)]
*  But I don't like I don't like that to go away. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3475.24s)]
*  Suddenly, it felt like, oh, my God, then that was fake or something. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3477.44s)]
*  So sometimes I'll be like, please don't come because I want you to like [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3480.24s)]
*  crave me forever. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3483.56s)]
*  I always want that to be there. I hate when it goes away. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3484.88s)]
*  That's a great point. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3487.92s)]
*  And maybe that's because because I'll say this whenever I would ejaculate [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3489.08s)]
*  into my hand or whatever. Yeah. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3493.64s)]
*  It always felt like that wasn't supposed to be outside. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3495.4s)]
*  That's one thing that I always felt like. Yes. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3498.84s)]
*  It's like this doesn't feel like it's just supposed to be outside of me. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3501.28s)]
*  What? Because it's a waste. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3505.52s)]
*  That was that semen is to like make a baby. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3507.4s)]
*  And now your body has to like make more. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3510.28s)]
*  You just like wasted this thing that was going to keep you going, [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3512.2400000000002s)]
*  keep the human species going. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3515.76s)]
*  And you just blew it like your job as a man is to make sure that goes [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3517.44s)]
*  into a vagina that is fertile and you blew you failed. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3521.28s)]
*  So there of course, there would be some kind of like disappointment [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3524.4s)]
*  or shame on the other side of that subconsciously or even consciously. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3527.2s)]
*  You just blew it out here in the back of a school bus or behind a show. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3532.4399999999996s)]
*  And he's or something. Yeah. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3535.8399999999997s)]
*  Now you're just riding there on the bus next to your scene. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3537.7599999999998s)]
*  And you're just like, all right. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3540.24s)]
*  That's interesting, though, because I feel the same way after I have an orgasm. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3541.68s)]
*  But my thing is that I get sad because [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3545.6s)]
*  it's going to I get sad because I want to feel that again right now. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3549.52s)]
*  And I have to wait now to build it up again. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3553.08s)]
*  And I'm like, it's almost like after I like to wait to eat until I'm really hungry [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3555.6s)]
*  so that the food tastes better, like I love to wait. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3560.44s)]
*  I'm a pleasure to layer. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3563.16s)]
*  And so I always after I come home, I'm always just like, man, [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3564.7999999999997s)]
*  the most fun part of that whole thing was up until it happened. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3568.36s)]
*  Yeah. When it happened, it feels good. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3571.7999999999997s)]
*  But really, the best part is the anticipation. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3573.48s)]
*  That's why I love I love anticipation. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3576.2799999999997s)]
*  I love when the when I see the waiter bringing my food like that is [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3578.96s)]
*  that's a better feeling to me than when I'm actually eating it. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3582.7599999999998s)]
*  I think I like Christmas. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3585.56s)]
*  I notoriously as a kid, I would never open my Christmas presents. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3588.56s)]
*  I would just I would hoard them and be like because I didn't want Christmas to be over. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3591.24s)]
*  The saddest day of the year is December 26th. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3594.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I might argue the saddest day is December 25th. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3596.72s)]
*  The afternoon after Christmas, the presents are open because people are crying. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3599.7999999999997s)]
*  It's like what what could be? [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3604.16s)]
*  And now you know what is and it's fine. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3605.88s)]
*  It's Nintendo and you're psyched and you're playing duck hunt with your cousin. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3608.52s)]
*  But before that, it who knows what it could have been? [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3611.88s)]
*  Well, that's interesting. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3616.56s)]
*  I like to think of what if right? [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3618.04s)]
*  And I like to know what. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3621.04s)]
*  Yeah, maybe that's some of the differences right there between men and women. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3623.36s)]
*  You like to know what? [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3626.24s)]
*  I like to know exactly what's going to go on. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3627.4s)]
*  Yeah, I don't like there to be a lot of room for. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3629.44s)]
*  I think that scares me, you know, if there's like a lot of like what could happen. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3632.4s)]
*  I think that's just some of the difference between men and women. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3637.08s)]
*  You know, I think that's why like you can see a male orgasm. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3639.68s)]
*  You know, it's like, yeah, you know, women orgasm, you're like, maybe. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3644.24s)]
*  Yeah, we don't know. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3648.3199999999997s)]
*  Yes. But, you know, it's more like up in the air is what I'm saying. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3649.4399999999996s)]
*  Even if you go to that, you know, yeah, this lady said something. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3653.0s)]
*  What you got here, Zach, or you had a video you wanted us to see? [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3655.9199999999996s)]
*  Yeah, while we're on this topic, there's a Utah state rep. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3658.52s)]
*  It's getting a lot of flack for this kind of hot take about semen. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3662.12s)]
*  Oh, man, that I clearly don't trust women enough to make choices, [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3666.68s)]
*  to control their own body. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3670.52s)]
*  And my response is I do trust women enough. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3671.68s)]
*  To control when they allow a man to ejaculate inside of them [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3674.3199999999997s)]
*  and to control that intake of semen. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3677.56s)]
*  So that may be inflammatory. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3680.08s)]
*  But I think as a legislature, we have the responsibility [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3681.96s)]
*  to create a legal framework that is friendly and supporting rights that I. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3686.2799999999997s)]
*  So she's saying you can control how much semen goes in you. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3692.12s)]
*  No, you can't. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3694.48s)]
*  Well, because, um, no, I mean, like men are stronger than us. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3696.12s)]
*  Sorry. It's like that's the bottom line. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3700.64s)]
*  Like we all of this is about if we were as strong as you guys, [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3703.04s)]
*  this would not be an issue. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3706.64s)]
*  Like nothing. It's we're the weaker sex physically. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3707.68s)]
*  I mean, some of us can work out hard enough. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3710.16s)]
*  And there's jujitsu to use your body strength against yourself. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3712.0s)]
*  But like generally, we cannot fight you off if you decide [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3715.32s)]
*  in the middle of sex to hold us down. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3719.36s)]
*  It wouldn't take much. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3721.24s)]
*  It doesn't take much. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3722.48s)]
*  Even if we're so fast and we work out every day, [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3723.2799999999997s)]
*  a guy who doesn't work out in a quick sprint can catch us. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3725.88s)]
*  You guys are faster and more powerful. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3728.48s)]
*  So, no, we can't control. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3730.64s)]
*  If you want to come in us, you can come in us. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3731.64s)]
*  Oh, dang. Well, thanks. First of all. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3734.12s)]
*  Second of all, I didn't say may you. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3738.8799999999997s)]
*  Oh, yeah. That old bathroom trick. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3743.0s)]
*  No, I'm not doing anything like that, man. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3745.24s)]
*  I never I will. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3747.4s)]
*  I mean, I will not. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3748.7599999999998s)]
*  I will like to even go and ejaculate in the other room, you know. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3751.6s)]
*  I know that's not a bad idea because you don't associate it with the girl. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3756.8399999999997s)]
*  And so you might still have that in you to be like, I'm going to fuck her. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3760.16s)]
*  And so you might still be interested in her. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3763.44s)]
*  That's like actually one of the tactics they talk about in this book [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3765.04s)]
*  I read about male orgasms and avoiding them is like if he has to come like [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3768.24s)]
*  have him not associate it with you and then he'll still like you. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3771.7999999999997s)]
*  Because it's about like some of that, I think makes sense, you know. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3775.3199999999997s)]
*  But yeah, sometimes I feel so bad about all the, you know, just all the [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3779.24s)]
*  ejaculate or whatever that I left in different places and just shouldn't have left. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3783.6s)]

*  You feel like it's like, yeah, sometimes I would even drive [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3789.44s)]
*  through my old neighborhood and even look at that spot where you buried it [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3791.7200000000003s)]
*  to see if the tree grew. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3795.52s)]

*  when he caught you the first time you got caught masturbating. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3808.16s)]
*  You had to take your semen and bury it in the yard. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3811.4s)]
*  Like, of course, you have issues with like a like gardening. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3813.56s)]
*  First of all. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3817.52s)]

*  I mean, like everything we do is because of something that happened in our childhood. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3825.52s)]
*  I know, isn't it crazy? [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3829.7200000000003s)]
*  Less than we learned from our parents who were just like doing their best, [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3830.6s)]
*  which wasn't really that great. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3834.2400000000002s)]

*  which seems really painful. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3864.56s)]
*  But yeah, that makes sense. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=3865.76s)]

*  first of all, I have to be an adult, too. I got to do adult stuff, you know, taxes and stamps. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=4329.360000000001s)]

*  you know. But I have the new thing of like on an airplane, I really like to like curl up in a ball [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=4345.360000000001s)]
*  like on the window and I put my foot up on the thing and I don't I make sure not to disturb anyone. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=4351.12s)]

*  Like this is not this is not that's not that's a child thing to do. Right. This is not OK. Like [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=4361.68s)]
*  we're I still want to behave like a little like a child, like the eye contact thing. Like sometimes [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=4367.599999999999s)]
*  I just don't want to make eye contact with people. And and I go, that's a thing I did when I was 12 [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=4372.64s)]
*  when I was scared to look an adult in the eye. Like, why am I still doing this? Yeah. Yeah. I [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=4377.76s)]
*  think it's all of those ghosts of being a child, you know. That's all we all become is just the [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=4381.84s)]
*  haunted house for ghosts of of our youth. Oh, yeah. I'm fucking so stuck at 15. Are you? That's like [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=4386.4800000000005s)]
*  every time I talk to my therapist about like my fears about you said, I just have fears of like [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=4395.52s)]
*  boys being mean to me and being like if I reject a guy, they'll be like, well, I didn't even want [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=4400.16s)]
*  to fuck you anyway. You're old and disgusting. Like they'll say the meanest thing back, [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=4404.08s)]
*  which we know guys that do that, like the season of FBoy Island. That's my biggest fear for these [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=4407.44s)]
*  girls that like these three girls sign up for the show and then on and what is on their kids [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=4412.24s)]
*  fucking each other by the beach? Yeah, man. That's like it's it's 13 real sexy and 13 nice guys. So [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=4415.759999999999s)]

*  because if you get chosen, then you get money. You also get the girl. But then if you're an FBoy and [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=4429.599999999999s)]
*  it's so you're there to like trick girls, but the girls don't know who is who. But my biggest fear [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=4435.36s)]
*  was like these girls are going to eliminate an FBoy who's been pretending to be nice the whole [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=4439.28s)]
*  time. And then when they do, the guy's going to be like, I didn't think any of you were hot anyway. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=4442.879999999999s)]

*  just so hot that they they're just like and they have confidence, like and they're 10 years younger [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=4451.36s)]

*  like worked hard to have the amount of confidence I have, which isn't much, but they don't care at [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=4460.56s)]
*  all. These guys are so they will say the meanest shit and they still like them and know they still [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=4465.4400000000005s)]
*  they're just like, bye. Whereas I would be like, he just said the thing that I've always thought [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=4469.76s)]
*  about myself. Like, that's why I will not read YouTube comments on this video. I will not. I [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=4474.88s)]
*  only read Instagram comments on my own stuff because it tends to be nicer, but I don't read [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=4479.360000000001s)]

*  from that. It's why I started having guests on here more instead of just doing solo because I [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=4804.56s)]
*  was just getting burned out. I didn't want to put my not best self out there. And then also I want [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=4808.88s)]
*  to be able to have the energy for the shows. That's the part I like the best getting to meet people [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=4814.400000000001s)]
*  after. So it's like, you know, it's just like, I had to monitor, like, it's just been tough. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=4818.320000000001s)]
*  And I didn't realize, I thought like, Oh, you just keep going. People want to see you. I was a people [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=4824.400000000001s)]
*  pleaser. Like I wanted, it's the same as like being at the lunch table when you're a kid and you like, [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=4828.56s)]
*  get your buddies to laugh. You're like, Oh, I just want that. You know, this just keeps getting [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=4832.72s)]
*  bigger. Well, this is all we ever wanted. And now people like actually like us and want to come see, [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=4837.280000000001s)]
*  like, how could you say no to that? And also the meet and greets, like I love meeting fans. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=4841.280000000001s)]
*  And at this point, it's like, when you do meet and greets, it's not just like random people that just [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=4846.320000000001s)]
*  came to the club to see you. Like they're actually people that like you and like have good boundaries. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=4850.64s)]
*  Like I like my fans now, but sometimes I'm like, you gotta understand. I can't do it. I want to [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=4854.72s)]
*  meet you guys, but it's just, it's too exhausting. And you, I wouldn't want to meet someone who didn't [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=4859.44s)]
*  have the energy. I would never want to put out someone that I was a fan of if they didn't want [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=4865.44s)]
*  to do it. Like, and it makes me mad when people are like, you canceled the meet and greet. I'm like, [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=4869.679999999999s)]
*  do you want to meet me when I'm tired and I don't want to meet you? Is that don't you wish I would [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=4875.44s)]
*  cancel that? I'll give you your money back and I'll love to meet you another time. But why would you [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=4880.08s)]
*  want me to do something I don't want to do? But it's hard because I do want to do it. Sometimes [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=4884.16s)]
*  I'm just like, God, can I just go to a town and do meet and greets? Yeah. There's a show and a [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=4889.12s)]
*  meet and greet is, and then do a two show night. That's four shows. I know it's a lot of energy. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=4892.48s)]
*  Well, that's a weird thing. It just becomes, well, it just, it's a lot of like putting yourself out [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=4897.76s)]
*  there, you know, there's any good, even goes back to what we're talking about in the beginning. It's [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=4901.5199999999995s)]
*  like, how much of me I got? Yeah. I just kept putting myself out there until it wasn't even about [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=4905.84s)]
*  whatever I had. I know I quit feeling like myself a couple of years ago. I'm just starting to get [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=4915.84s)]
*  moments where I feel like myself again. But, um, yeah, it's you, it's just fear, you know, a lot of fear [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=4920.8s)]
*  and you don't want to let people down. That's another thing. Being a disappointment and being, [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=4926.8s)]
*  and being forgotten. You think, oh, if I don't take the show, you know, your agents will be let down [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=4931.5199999999995s)]
*  and then the people will be let down and you might be forgotten and someone else is going to be doing [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=4939.2s)]
*  stand-up that night and they're going to get this much better than you because they had one more gym [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=4944.0s)]
*  session because it's like going to the doing stand-ups like going to the gym. So not doing [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=4948.32s)]
*  sets every fucking night, which is why I moved to St. Louis because it's not like a comedy town. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=4951.44s)]
*  So I'm not like, there's not places I'm dying. There's not great place. There's clubs there, [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=4956.48s)]
*  but it's a little bit of a far drive. I moved there to get away from the pressure of doing [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=4960.8s)]
*  stand-up every fucking night because I come here, I'm here for five days and I have like [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=4964.48s)]
*  five sets every night because I can't turn them down because. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=4968.16s)]
*  You know, I don't, I, because it's a gym session and because it's like, I, I'm going to get better [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=4972.96s)]
*  and I can't stand passing up an opportunity to get better and to be loved by strangers. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=4978.0s)]
*  Yeah. I feel you, man. It's that quiet hole, you know? Yeah. And then feeling like, oh, well, [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=4986.0s)]
*  they don't really know me even though I'm so honest. I mean, you're so honest too. Like the [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=4990.8s)]
*  fact that you can even say like, oh, I've gotten an escort this many times. It's been like that [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=4994.48s)]
*  kind of stuff. People don't talk about it and they rely on us to talk about it so that they can go, [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=4998.16s)]
*  oh, maybe I'm not a bad person because I've gotten an escort. Okay. Theo has to like that shit is [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5002.639999999999s)]
*  important for us to share, but there's sometimes where I'm like, man, pull it back a little bit. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5007.36s)]
*  No one, people don't need to know this and you have to, I, there are very few things that I keep [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5011.759999999999s)]

*  when I got caught shoplifting and I didn't get in trouble for it. They let me go and no one knew [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5185.04s)]

*  what is this? And for some reason it was just exactly what I needed. And I just went to it [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5198.16s)]
*  without even thinking and I did it. Yeah. And, and man, I mean, I have so many, so many people [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5203.2s)]
*  cut themselves. It's very common thing. And it's a, I, I feel the desire often instead. Now I just [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5209.52s)]
*  Google people who cut themselves to hear about their stories and read about it because not so I [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5215.6s)]
*  can like watch it happening and feel like, Oh, I'm doing it. It just, I think that it just helps to [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5221.52s)]
*  see people that feel as sad and fucked up as you do and, and just know you're not that weird. And [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5226.56s)]

*  talking about it. Same with suicide. I mean, I think that's the same thing of like, I, like I see [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5236.56s)]

*  I'm feeling sad about myself or about the world. Like I get, I just think about killing myself and [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5251.120000000001s)]
*  it's like literally soothing. Like I will just go to bed and just like smile thinking about the [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5255.360000000001s)]
*  option and I'm not going to do it. I know like I've made a pact with myself as much as you can, [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5260.88s)]
*  never going to do it no matter how much I want to, but man, that like just. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5266.08s)]

*  No, I know. That's why I talk about it because if I don't talk about it, that's when it can get out [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5272.16s)]
*  of control. But I feel like if I'm honest about it, I've never attempted it. I've never planned [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5276.96s)]
*  anything. I've never written a note. Like I've honestly- [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5282.32s)]
*  Have you written a note or not? [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5285.04s)]
*  No, no. I mean, the first step would be cleaning my apartment and like getting my [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5286.5599999999995s)]
*  affairs in order so that my parents wouldn't have to like deal with that stuff. And even that is [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5290.16s)]
*  like, that's really, I mean, I used to have a joke about it, but honestly, a lot of times my [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5293.68s)]
*  apartment's so messy. The idea of even like my mom would have to deal with my death and have to like [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5297.280000000001s)]

*  lived like a fucking hoarder. Like that judgment on the other side of my death. I would need to- [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5308.0s)]
*  And I would already be in a casket. If I'm killing myself, I'm killing myself in a casket. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5313.6s)]
*  Yeah. I want to make it like as easy for people, but that's not possible and it's never going to [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5317.52s)]
*  be easy. And I will literally never- It is possible. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5321.52s)]
*  No, it's not possible to make it easy because you will always leave behind people that it's [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5325.120000000001s)]
*  not emotionally easy. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5328.8s)]

*  Even if you write a note like, take it easy, bub, you know, sorry or whatever. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5335.200000000001s)]

*  all right, I'm going to take it easy since he's dead. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5339.68s)]
*  But so many people think like, oh, they'll be better off without me. You know, like that's the [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5341.6s)]
*  thing. And like it's committing suicide is a disease. It's the end of a disease. It's like, [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5345.120000000001s)]
*  you know, stage four. It's like, it's a terminal illness. So no one like, I don't ever blame anyone [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5349.44s)]
*  who commits suicide because I feel like they really don't have a choice that was- [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5355.2s)]
*  No, they're trying to alleviate whatever pain is inside of them. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5358.4s)]
*  Yeah. And their pain is in them [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5361.599999999999s)]
*  so much they're like, the only way to stop this pain is to stop where it lives, which is inside [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5363.04s)]
*  of myself. Yeah. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5369.92s)]
*  It makes sense. Yeah. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5370.88s)]
*  But it's- But let's talk about something else. Is that okay? [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5372.96s)]
*  Please. I'm sorry to even get on that, but I just want to say that like, if you have thoughts like [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5376.160000000001s)]
*  that out there, like seriously, it's a part of a disease. Your brain is like fucked. You're not, [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5381.280000000001s)]
*  because I would get into, whenever I get into that, let's take it suicide. I bet any negative [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5388.0s)]
*  thought about myself. Sometimes you like believe, I believe like, oh, this is the truth. Like sometimes [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5391.84s)]
*  I don't want to take my antidepressants because I'm like, they're lies. I really see the truth. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5396.8s)]
*  And I don't want to feel better because this is the truth. The world is shit. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5401.92s)]
*  Climate change. I'm old. No one cares about me. I'm not funny. I'm not like, I'm not that interesting. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5405.6s)]
*  No one really loves me. And I know that if I take a pill, I won't feel those thoughts, [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5412.0s)]
*  but sometimes I'm like, then you're just dumbing yourself. But really I have a sickness. I have [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5416.4800000000005s)]
*  the flu for my brain and I'm thinking that the flu is like right and it's not. Oh, that's [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5422.320000000001s)]
*  interesting. Yeah. So if that helps anyone or maybe if that makes anyone feel worse, please call [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5427.68s)]
*  someone. There's always someone that will talk to you about how you feel. Yeah. I mean, yeah, [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5432.64s)]
*  it's hard to tell in every moment on a like if you're helping people or hurting them, you know, [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5437.280000000001s)]
*  but that's just like sharing the shit like as dark as it is. I think it's got to help because [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5442.72s)]
*  whenever I find people like talking about stuff and I go, oh, their life is probably perfect. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5446.96s)]
*  Not that anyone ever thinks that my life is perfect, but I just find that I always want to know [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5451.04s)]
*  when I just want people to be more honest about how they struggle or insecure. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5456.240000000001s)]
*  You know, I sometimes I look at girls and I'm like, projects so much perfection onto like these [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5460.5599999999995s)]
*  models and like, God, they never get sad. Their homes are probably so clean and perfect and [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5465.44s)]
*  their skin is just glowy all the time. And I just am so jealous and so resentful. And then I hear [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5471.5199999999995s)]
*  that they like hate the way they look. And part of me goes, fuck you, bitch. You hate the way you [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5477.84s)]
*  look, you model. But then I don't know what then I kind of feel like it actually helps me because I [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5481.44s)]
*  go like, well, this is just a sickness because clearly this girl is like she's not of the right [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5485.84s)]
*  mind. So maybe I have a little hint of that. Yeah. Maybe I'm not seeing myself clearly. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5492.64s)]
*  Well, I think that's what's really interesting is that as much footage and everything as we [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5498.400000000001s)]
*  have now of ourselves that we don't see ourselves clearly. Dude, somehow we've lost this huge [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5503.2s)]
*  perception of of what even the value of being human. I mean, I think it almost goes back to like [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5509.76s)]
*  we were talking about about the moment. It's like, it doesn't feel like we're enough anymore. It [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5516.400000000001s)]
*  feels like even I thought about this the other day, it feels like it used to feel like 20 years ago, [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5523.2s)]
*  if you died, it would really mean something and it would matter. And it would really have like a [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5528.8s)]
*  longevity to people. And now that doesn't really feel. It feels like people would get over it pretty [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5534.56s)]
*  quickly and the world would move on. That's what it feels like. It feels like so much faster than [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5541.200000000001s)]
*  it would have even those closest to you and not even because they would want to, but just because [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5545.4400000000005s)]
*  of how whatever's happening to us as a species, you know, yeah, you got to move on and I, you, [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5551.280000000001s)]
*  you do not have to move on that quick. If one of us dies. No, you don't, but like you kind of do, [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5557.92s)]
*  because you're never coming back. If I die, dude, I'm renting out a holiday in for like seven years. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5562.56s)]
*  People can come there whenever they want and think about me or look at it. Maybe leave images or [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5568.160000000001s)]
*  something in there. People can look at them, maybe leave like a little, you know, a little replica [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5573.280000000001s)]
*  hand with no fingers on it, you know, and people can just beat themselves with it. I don't know, [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5578.96s)]
*  but but here's the crazy part. I bet after like a week, nobody would even come. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5584.96s)]
*  No, no, you're right for anyone, but I think that anybody, I mean, I mean, I just recently [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5589.76s)]
*  went to Columbine because I just, I don't know what happened my freshman year of high school. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5594.72s)]
*  It was very just, I was just morbidly curious, I guess, about it. I was, I've always been fascinated [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5600.16s)]
*  by it. I read a few books about it and I'm like, I'm, I love, I don't, I hate to say I love Columbine, [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5606.08s)]
*  but like the way that some women are obsessed with murders and we go, oh, they're murderistas [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5611.6s)]
*  or whatever and it's like, cute. That's you. That's me. But for like, for Columbine 9-11, [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5617.12s)]
*  a little bit like I'm my high school is bookended by Columbine 9-11. And so like, [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5621.76s)]
*  but I went to Columbine and I, it was so weird to go to this place where this like this thing [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5626.48s)]
*  happened, go to the Memorial that is on kind of right off campus. And it's just like, no one else [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5632.8s)]
*  is there like memorializing it. Like I thought it would be like crowds, but it's just like, no, [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5638.16s)]
*  this is the students that go there. Don't even think about that. Like maybe they do, [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5643.5199999999995s)]
*  but it doesn't seem like it was like in the air there. It's like they've moved on and I'm still [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5647.599999999999s)]
*  like, how is everyone here? Like, I just thought that everyone knew that I was there to like check [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5652.5599999999995s)]
*  out where things happen and no one cared. There was, I saw a cop car and I'm like, oh, they [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5657.12s)]
*  probably patrol this area so that people don't come and like, you know, and he's not, yeah, [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5661.12s)]
*  he's just a cop car at a high school. Like any other high school. Yeah. Yeah. They got a new [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5665.919999999999s)]
*  dunk and put it around the corner. Yeah. But people move on. Yeah. And I remember one time [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5671.92s)]
*  a friend of mine died and I was, I had too much, I had a busy week and I, I had too much going on. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5677.28s)]
*  And I remember thinking, I can't, I can't cancel this thing that I have to be happy for and like [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5684.4800000000005s)]
*  on for. And I just put a bookmark in my feelings because I go, he's never not going to be dead. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5690.0s)]
*  I can do this later. Wow. Like I, it doesn't need to happen now. I can literally just save [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5695.68s)]
*  this for later. And I just didn't feel anything completely shut myself off to the sadness for a [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5701.44s)]
*  few days and was able to do that because I just rationalized like I have all the time in the world. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5706.96s)]
*  He's never coming back. Like, so I think that I'll tell him by later. Yeah. Yeah. That's what [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5711.599999999999s)]
*  everybody, everything feels like that now, but I wonder what happens as a society. If when you get [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5716.48s)]
*  all those unprocessed feelings and all that, I don't know. And I think we're just learning too, [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5721.44s)]
*  you know, and also we store everything now in this third party. There's like a third party [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5726.4s)]
*  to existence. It used to just be you and God or you know, you and the universe. Oh, now there's [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5731.04s)]
*  the cloud. And now there is this other, yeah, there's this other kind of mirror, but it's also [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5735.76s)]
*  like a mirror that has, you feel like somebody's behind it with a control a little bit. You mean [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5745.44s)]
*  like your social media presence? I just mean all of this, everything, us recording it, you know, [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5752.88s)]
*  all of it, how we record everything. Yeah. You know, it's like, I'll record this and then I'll [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5758.24s)]
*  watch. We never watching of it later. It never means it's like, it's like the moment. I don't know. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5763.44s)]
*  It's just something about the moment used to matter more to us because we didn't get so many [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5770.639999999999s)]
*  of them. Now it's like, you can open your tick tock and get a thousand moments from other people [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5775.84s)]
*  and look at them all and whatever. And so the moment doesn't have as much. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5779.5199999999995s)]
*  Pictures, like we stick pictures and like you get them developed and it was an event to get them [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5784.0s)]
*  back. And now we don't even print pictures. They don't hang pictures up. They're just in our phone [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5790.32s)]
*  and, and that was old. And then, yeah, I'm half 99% of will never make it out. Never be seen again. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5795.2s)]
*  And it's like, it's just, and then we're all doing that instead of being, you know, [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5802.08s)]
*  I sometimes look at my own Instagram feed. It's like we all work for Sony kind of. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5808.4s)]
*  We kind of, I mean, I think we do. I think that's or whoever owns Sony, but it's like, [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5814.32s)]
*  sometimes I look at my own Instagram feed and I'll get jealous of myself. God, she's like, [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5820.4s)]
*  I'll forget. I'm almost looking at myself and I'll go back far enough where it seems like a [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5826.8s)]
*  different person's life. And I'm like, God, she has it all. She's killing it. And I'll have that [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5830.48s)]
*  moment of like, fuck, I'm doing it to myself. Like, so when I do it to other people, it's gotta be a [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5834.24s)]
*  lie because I remember that day I was not happy and I look like I'm killing it. Oh my God. She [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5838.88s)]
*  does everything. She's so busy. She works so hard. I start getting like threatened by my [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5843.12s)]
*  past self. And then I always run the risk of like, when I post something like, [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5848.48s)]
*  I don't want to look like I'm like, look at me, but I also need people to look at me. And I'm always [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5853.12s)]
*  mitigating this. Like, I hope people don't think I think I'm cool, but I also want people to think [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5860.0s)]
*  I'm cool. But you can't like my biggest fear that I always think is like, I just don't want female [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5864.96s)]
*  comics, mainly female comics to screenshot this and text it to each other in a mass text of like, [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5871.2s)]
*  making fun of me and being like, look at how sweet she thinks she is. She looks, she thinks she looks [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5876.48s)]
*  hot here. Isn't that sad? What does she, what's going on with her? Yeah. That's what I think [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5879.92s)]
*  about her. Like, you really, you think about that. Oh yeah. Like my peers, my funny peers, who I look [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5885.84s)]
*  up to, you know, talking about me because we do that. I mean, and when I do it, it's always when [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5891.2s)]
*  I'm threatened. It's always a girl showing her body in a way that I'm like, oh my God, I say, [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5896.96s)]
*  I say, oh, this is so sad, but really I'm like, I wish I could show my body like that and be that [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5900.88s)]
*  free and like not care what people think. Who is more threatening to women? You think at other female [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5905.28s)]
*  comedian women or other men comedians? I think it's, I think it's a totally different thing. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5912.0s)]
*  And so it's kind of hard to compare the two because it's such a different kind of threat, but [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5918.16s)]
*  um, female comedians, like we, yeah, we definitely are threatened by one another. And I think it's, [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5922.400000000001s)]
*  it podcasts is more conversational nature of what we're doing now and sharing. And like, [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5927.4400000000005s)]
*  it's made me a lot more open about like my insecurities and being able to tell women. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5933.28s)]
*  Like I need to mute, I need to mute you sometimes. Like I mean, I'm sometimes I, you know, [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5937.04s)]
*  telling Taylor Tomlinson, like I, like I sometimes don't watch your clips because I don't want to know [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5941.76s)]
*  how funny you are because it makes me feel insecure. Or I like, I, I being able to say, [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5949.28s)]
*  it's so embarrassing to say that, but like, it's just true and it's not, and it's not helping [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5955.839999999999s)]
*  anything. But yeah, I think that we, I know, yeah, there's tons of female comics that have, I mean, [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5960.5599999999995s)]
*  my biggest, uh, my, the worst interactions I've had in comedy have been with female comics. Like [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5965.5199999999995s)]
*  I was pretty badly bullied what like in standup when I first got into it, like almost bullied out [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5972.8s)]
*  of comedy when I first started and just looked up to this girl that was on the scene, like only [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5978.72s)]
*  wanted to be her, had nothing but reverence for her, did not even consider that. I mean, [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5984.16s)]
*  I was not a standup that like thought I was good when I first started. I was not one that was like, [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5989.84s)]
*  Hey, asking the headliner to watch my set. Like I was embarrassed because I knew I was bad because [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5993.84s)]
*  I just started and I knew that I was going to get better. But did you work with the girl or no? [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=5998.56s)]
*  You know, we were in the same scene in St. Louis and like, she was the top dog on the scene. So [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6003.6s)]
*  funny, a little bit older and, um, and she just hated me, just hated me, thought I wasn't funny. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6007.84s)]
*  Um, and then she also thought Tommy John again, wasn't funny. He was, we were kind of like the [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6014.88s)]
*  two young comics in St. Louis. And that's when I knew like, Oh, I'm probably funny because if [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6018.72s)]
*  she thinks Tommy's not Tommy's just, I knew Tommy was funny. So I was like, Oh, she just [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6022.56s)]
*  thinks anyone who's funny, funny isn't funny. So that, that made me feel better. But she, [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6026.72s)]
*  she just like spread lies that I slept with people for stage time. And I was a fucking [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6031.92s)]
*  virgin at the time. Like I literally had never had sex. And I was, she's saying I was sucking [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6035.68s)]
*  dick for stage time when I was turning down stage time. I mean, there were guys, there were [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6039.92s)]
*  headliners that came through and they would offer me guest sets because they probably liked me. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6043.92s)]
*  And I was funny enough, but you know, have you ever blown an Indian guy before? No, no. Why? [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6048.72s)]
*  I don't know. No, I haven't not yet. Bucket list. You got to get out there. Huh? [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6055.6s)]
*  It's weird. Sometimes I think I feel like I can't even, I never, I feel like Indian people don't [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6062.96s)]
*  even have penises. I feel like I've never, I don't know. I never even like even in porn, I never even. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6067.04s)]
*  Yeah. I guess I don't see much Indian representation in porn. They don't Indian P. Yeah. It's like, [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6072.320000000001s)]
*  I can't even imagine. I can't even imagine Indian guy with a penis. Really? Yeah. I can for some [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6078.240000000001s)]
*  reason. I'm like, I'm into it. Yeah. What else? We want to go through a couple of news topics. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6085.12s)]
*  All right. Anything else we want to talk about? I feel like we covered everything. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6093.5199999999995s)]
*  Did we? This is good. I mean, not like everything. It's been a good conversation. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6096.88s)]
*  How do you think it's been, Zach? All right. Oh yeah. You're about an hour 40. Would you like [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6099.599999999999s)]
*  tell us the truth, Zach? Would you ever be like, this was not your best and then just take it out [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6104.4s)]
*  later? I don't think you would. I would tell you the truth. All right. Okay. Good. No laws at all. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6109.28s)]
*  Okay. That's good. Still don't know if I'm no laws like no L.O.L.s. Yeah. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6114.4s)]
*  L.U.L.L. Yes. Yes. Yes. Okay. This is a story we were talking about. You're talking about DMS earlier. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6119.92s)]
*  Those are cat is calling out Noah, this guy from Stranger Things. He plays a will. I guess she [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6125.2s)]
*  DM him trying to hook up with the guy who plays Eddie on the show. Oh, you're familiar. And he [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6130.639999999999s)]
*  shared their DM thread and she called him out saying it's kind of weasel shit. So isn't this [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6136.48s)]
*  kid 17 that she DMS? Yes, but she's DMS him about with the guy. I still think it's like, [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6141.44s)]
*  I'm not saying that she's doing anything inappropriate by DMS a 17 year old, but [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6148.4s)]
*  17 year old is might screenshot your conversation. I mean, he's a child. So don't get mad. And also [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6153.04s)]
*  it's a little strange. Just DMS the guy that you're into. This is the guy she was trying to [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6158.639999999999s)]
*  hook up with. Looks like when no one a writer. Okay. I don't watch the show, but so what did [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6163.5199999999995s)]
*  she say? I can't read that. What was her first? Okay. Noah, can you tell Joseph to hit me up? [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6169.76s)]
*  Wait, no. Does he have a girlfriend? And he goes LMA oh, slide into his DMS. Okay. Is IG on [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6178.96s)]
*  Twitter or Twitter. He doesn't have a DM to slide into. Okay. So she, she would have, [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6184.88s)]
*  oh, and then he sent her it right here, ma'am. Oh, he called her ma'am. Oh, ouch. That is cold. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6189.360000000001s)]
*  And I think it's strange. She went through a, why do you, it's cause sometimes people will do this [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6196.96s)]
*  thing. They will say, Hey, what about your friend? But they're really trying to after you. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6205.6s)]
*  That was my first thought too. I don't want to make any accusations. I don't make any accusations. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6211.92s)]
*  I mean, that's just very realistic. How old is Doja Cat? They got a writer name. TMZ loves to say, [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6216.4800000000005s)]
*  or they got a writer age. These publications love to say a woman's age. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6222.72s)]
*  Don't you get is 26. Okay. 26. Sorry. That's if I was trying to get a, [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6227.36s)]
*  find out about a guy, I would not go to one of his children, co-stars to find out his thing. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6234.64s)]
*  And she also may not have known how old this guy is. Maybe, but you know, yeah. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6241.04s)]
*  Yeah. I think, Oh, do you ever worry about that girl's screenshot and your stuff? [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6246.64s)]
*  What girl? Just any girls like you DM, maybe like, you know, fans. Yeah. I've never seen, [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6250.08s)]
*  I'd never have sent anything really in obscene or nothing. You know, my buddy, I used to use a [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6255.36s)]
*  dick pic for, you know, two times I sent it, but it was my buddy's my friend, Jason. Oh, that's good. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6260.96s)]
*  And it looked like yours enough that it was like, okay, to use or were you just like, [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6265.679999999999s)]
*  No, I think it was just, you know, I was probably, you know, driving or something. And I just was [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6270.24s)]
*  like, I need a dick pic. Hey, yeah. And like, Hey, can you, you know, and he's kind of, he's 17 [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6275.04s)]
*  and he's looking for work. Yeah. He's 17. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6281.12s)]
*  Um, well, let's get some real news. Is there any adult news going on? [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6286.4s)]
*  Oh yeah. Yeah. So Elon's walking away from his Twitter deal. Twitter's [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6292.8s)]
*  threat. What waste of all of our time talking about this guy, but buying it really. Why he had twin, [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6297.2s)]
*  he's having twins apparently with someone. I know it. One of the people who works, [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6304.24s)]
*  how efficient is he? He's having fucking twins, dude. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6307.6s)]
*  You got to respect that guy. Two birds. Um, yeah, I was just annoyed by this. This is like when [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6313.4400000000005s)]
*  people say they're going, they're retiring and then come out of retirement. I go, we wasted so [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6321.6s)]
*  much energy talking about you buying Twitter and now you're not, it's like, God, can I get that time [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6325.76s)]
*  back? I know. But he said, you got to set Twitter free. It's just way too far left. Like, uh, [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6330.400000000001s)]
*  it just caters to way too much of one side of all views. I feel like it's just seems like a, [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6337.76s)]
*  cause here's what I wish you would do better. I hope he doesn't. I hope he gets it and then just [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6344.56s)]
*  kills it. Oh, that's yeah. You're right. I mean, I would, I'm already pretty much done because print [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6349.76s)]
*  is kind of dead. Yes. So once that's gone, what are we going to do? Then it's just going to be [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6354.400000000001s)]
*  video stuff. I just think it leaves us in a better spot because you can, that's the only place you [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6360.56s)]
*  can easily go and just get all these other like quick replies and like thoughts from people. It's [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6366.4800000000005s)]
*  like, you know, the other, um, social media platforms, there's not as, it doesn't seem as [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6372.64s)]
*  easy to do that. It's like, you know, you can pull some comments off of Instagram feeds, but that [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6379.6s)]
*  doesn't feel like it's going to catch fire. Right. Ideas don't catch fire as quickly as Twitter. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6384.160000000001s)]
*  Right. Yeah. Yeah. You're right. That's a good, that's an interesting perspective of he would [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6388.400000000001s)]
*  have run it into the ground. Yeah. And now that's not going to happen. Right. And then I don't know [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6392.0s)]
*  if there's another one that gets people's like, where they can quote people as much and is easily [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6395.92s)]
*  with print. And so then it like kind of sets us free from all that. So I feel like the best thing [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6400.64s)]
*  that he could do, Elon, that's even your name, which it probably isn't, but is buy it and kill it. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6406.96s)]
*  You know, you know, what do they say? Kill birds or whatever, or don't, I don't know what they say, [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6414.64s)]
*  man, but do it. What else do we have? Oh, we got the Roe versus Wade. You guys, they overturn Roe [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6419.76s)]
*  versus. Wait, was there more news? Yeah. I mean, Louisiana is one of the places where they just put [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6426.96s)]
*  it in. They had a, they banned it. Yeah. Same with Missouri, where I live. I'm shocked kind of that [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6432.72s)]
*  this happened. Yeah. Yeah. It's sad. I, for the first time ever, like I hearing people say, [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6439.92s)]
*  you know, don't tell a woman what to do with her body. Like the people that believe abortion is [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6450.56s)]
*  like literally killing a baby. Like I kind of see their point. If you believe that it's a baby [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6455.36s)]
*  at a certain like late term abortion, I don't think any, I wouldn't be for that. And I'm very [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6462.8s)]
*  pro-choice. And how late do they do it? I mean, if it's. There should be a line for sure. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6467.76s)]
*  If it can smile or something, I think you can't do it. I don't know how they see that. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6472.400000000001s)]
*  You know what I'm saying though? Like if it can like. Yeah. I mean, there should be a line, [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6479.52s)]
*  but then it's like, okay, if you miss the day before that line, is that not like what, when is, [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6483.52s)]
*  what's the fucking line? But there needs to be one. But I do see for the first time when, when [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6489.6s)]
*  you know, people, people on the pro-choice side are saying, don't stop trying to control a woman's [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6494.8s)]
*  body. I mean, I believe that that is what they're trying to do. But I think that people that are [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6500.56s)]
*  pro-life a lot of times they just think you're killing babies. And I kind of Sarah Silverman [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6504.8s)]
*  used to have, I think a bit about like seeing little girls with signs outside of an abortion [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6508.56s)]
*  clinic, you know, picketing with their parents and these little girls literally think they're [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6512.96s)]
*  in there stabbing babies, which is like, of course you would be against that. So I don't, [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6515.84s)]
*  I don't blame people that really think it's a human life and, and are against that, but I really [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6520.72s)]
*  think this is about like wanting to punish women for being sluts. Like it's like you, you chose to, [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6526.8s)]
*  you wanted to fuck someone. And I don't know, this is me kind of going a step further. I think [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6533.68s)]
*  men want to punish women who don't fuck them. So, oh, you want to fuck someone other than me? [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6540.08s)]
*  You're going to have to keep the baby then you stupid slut. I think it's punishing women for [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6543.76s)]
*  being sluts. Men love sluts when they're sluts for them, but they fucking hate sluts when they're [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6547.76s)]
*  sluts for other men. And I say sluts as like, that's not what I'm calling them. That's what I think [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6553.76s)]
*  men think. I know what you're talking about. Yeah. Men think women just love dicks and men so much. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6559.2s)]
*  When really we have sex with men a lot of times, not because we love dicks in us, but because we [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6564.08s)]
*  want men to like us and to protect us. And we want to give you guys what you want. What does it feel [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6568.8s)]

*  like it does not feel like you're like, Oh, I'm going to throw up. No, it feels like, [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6589.360000000001s)]
*  I guess you just like, don't know what it's like. I'm not trying to imagine. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6598.96s)]
*  I'm just trying to think about it. That's the only thing that we can share is what anal sex [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6602.400000000001s)]
*  feels like. That's the only thing men and women can go, Oh, I know what you're talking about. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6608.08s)]
*  Which I kind of like about it. Is that why you think women and gay men get along well? [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6611.92s)]
*  No, but that is interesting. Um, but I do, I do like, I, I do like talking to gay men about [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6617.68s)]

*  like also like you're not doing it because you're like, I guess this is all we have. Like it literally [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6634.08s)]
*  feels good or they probably wouldn't do it, but they should be able to find another way to do it. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6638.16s)]
*  Also, dude, they can redesign a damn fucking living room in a heartbeat, but you can't, [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6642.0s)]
*  they don't need to find another way, dude. It feels so good. Well, then that's fine. Yeah. It [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6648.0s)]

*  get, they had this gay group in our area that was trying to get, um, it was like, we want to know [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6664.96s)]
*  what it feels like to have a period or whatever to like to partner with women. So they would wear in [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6670.56s)]
*  tampons in their bottom and for like four days a week. It feels like to put it in a tampon. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6676.88s)]
*  That was crazy, man. And they were like trying to get, you know, [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6682.96s)]
*  get people on board with that. I was like, dude, I ain't doing that. No, I would not suggest that [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6688.32s)]
*  that would be a dry tampon. Like there's nothing worse than putting a tampon up your vagina when [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6693.76s)]
*  you're not bleeding. It's like dry. That's what it would feel like up your asshole. That's terrible. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6698.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. This guy, yeah, this group was, no, this group was idiots. They weren't even, I don't know [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6702.24s)]
*  if they were even had a flag or they were sanctioned or whatever. It could have just been [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6706.48s)]
*  some pervy gay dudes. I cannot believe that that's a thing like in solidarity. Oh yeah. Really? All [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6713.44s)]
*  right. Oh my God. They used to have a lot of, I'm trying to think of like what it feels like. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6720.16s)]
*  They used to have a group called, I talked about, I talked about this before, but they used to have [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6726.24s)]
*  a group called F A G fist fights, right? That would come to the bars in Louisiana. It was gay [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6729.2s)]
*  men and they would come and fight and fist fight and you'd pay to go watch. Wait. Okay. So they [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6734.48s)]
*  would, but it was it just like, like boxing? Yeah. It was just gay boxing. And you would pay to go [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6740.16s)]
*  watch it? Yeah. We'd go there and drink. You'd go and drink and watch, you know, and it was, [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6745.919999999999s)]
*  it was erotic. What, like were they, were they enjoying it in an erotic way? Did you think it [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6749.36s)]
*  was like a sexual thing? No, they were beaten. They were beaten. If there was anything straight [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6753.12s)]
*  left in any of them, I think they'd beat it out of each other. Was it like a self-hating thing, [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6756.4s)]
*  you think as gay men? I don't know. Because they were, couldn't be themselves. I don't know. It [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6761.12s)]
*  reminds me of this kid that I grew up with and he dated this gal who I think was a lesbian, [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6765.76s)]
*  probably early lesbian, you know? And he would always, he had like, she would like bruise his [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6769.84s)]
*  penis up and it would like, he would always show us and it was like, dude, I don't think. She likes [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6774.8s)]
*  that. Yeah. Fuck. I mean, she never heard of anything like that. I mean, she would bruise, [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6780.48s)]
*  I mean, yeah, this kid Bradley and he used to be a referee. Did he like it? [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6787.36s)]
*  Cause there's some guys that- I think he was happy that somebody was touching his penis, [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6793.12s)]
*  but I think he wished it was somebody else. Oh man. Yeah. It looked like she had just, you know. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6795.92s)]
*  That is the thing about penises. Like you just asked me what it feels like to have a penis and [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6801.2s)]
*  you like, you don't, you can't understand what that feels like. And you even said before, like [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6804.24s)]
*  just loitering with the, you know, having a penis between your legs. Like that is wild to me that [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6807.92s)]
*  you guys have that just like swinging all the time. And that also the thing that blew my mind [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6813.28s)]
*  about penises when I first encountered them was that they go, I thought a boner just was like 90 [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6818.24s)]
*  degrees. I didn't know they could go like all the way up. And I love that they can just be like, [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6823.36s)]
*  I love a flaccid penis. I love playing with them. I think they're so fun. I like to just hold [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6827.2s)]
*  them when they're flaccid. And I know guys don't like that because it's like, oh, I'm small, [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6832.4s)]
*  but I just love, I just think they're so fun. Well, I'm laying down. If I squeeze my penis [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6835.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah. For long enough, I'll go to sleep. It's comforting. It's good. Yeah. It's good. The same [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6840.64s)]
*  way I think women do that with our tits. Just like hold it. The guy just gets to go do this. [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6848.400000000001s)]
*  And it feels like I get why that is exciting to men. And I just get to do it. Well, it feels [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6854.08s)]
*  like you're holding on to like the chain of life a little bit. You're like hugging your nurturing [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6858.72s)]
*  yourself. I like, again, I didn't get touched enough as a kid. I don't think in the right way, [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6866.0s)]
*  you know? Yeah. And so yeah, same. I think let's look at a little bit more. Yeah. So if this starts [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6869.76s)]
*  to happen, though, if they shut down the, uh, oh yeah, what's going to happen? Do you think like, [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6874.88s)]
*  how do you see that playing out? Just women getting them illegally, right? It's just going [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6879.52s)]
*  to be something for the elite. They're just or, and they're just going to do it in unsafe methods. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6884.4800000000005s)]
*  And so they're still going to be abortion, but it's just women back streets back. All right. [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6890.56s)]
*  Fuck that is so fucking funny. It's going to get a risk out there. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6894.56s)]
*  Honestly, that makes me feel so happy that out of all of that, all of this, that makes me so sad, [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6911.84s)]
*  you can make that joke and like that wouldn't exist without this happening. And I'm grateful [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6918.72s)]
*  that that joke can exist. It doesn't make it worth it, but that, that fact that I'm always, [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6923.6s)]
*  I'm going to tell everyone about this joke and that will bring a little bit of joy to this very [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6927.76s)]
*  scary time to just go back streets back. All right. Yeah. Yeah. With this abortion stuff, man, [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6932.88s)]
*  what if they start going back to those way? Like, no, it's so yeah, I've never had one. Um, and [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6941.200000000001s)]
*  doesn't look like I'm ever going to be able to, I live in Missouri, so I can't get one anymore. [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6949.36s)]
*  But I, you know, you just, I'd be, I'd, I'd find a way. So people are thinking to drive across state [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6954.639999999999s)]
*  lines to get them if I needed to be like little abortion wagons or whatever, like it was like a [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=6959.5199999999995s)]

*  broads all across state lines. You're contributing to the narrative. [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=7027.36s)]
*  Oh, it's so sad. It's ridiculous, man. It's like, have you ever had a scare? Have you ever had? [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=7034.08s)]
*  I'm sure I don't know. Like I won't even have sex two times in a row with the woman because I [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=7041.12s)]
*  don't want the possibility of since I got off a first time of any more semen getting in there. [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=7046.08s)]
*  Oh my God. It's like you're like buying two lottery tickets. You don't want to double your chances. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=7052.48s)]

*  it wasn't about shaming you though. It wasn't like, don't you fucking do this again. No, [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=7134.64s)]

*  Cause I guess if the, if the idea is that I get how religious people I get, if they are overtly [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=7151.2s)]
*  religious, religious, I get some of their, like you're saying I get their mindset. I can understand [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=7157.2s)]

*  We should probably fucking put some sanctions on this because, you know, Bill Clinton sacrifice, [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=7175.28s)]
*  think of what Bill Clinton sacrificed to get a blow job. Like really think about that because his [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=7182.48s)]
*  balls were full one day and it's flirty skirt walked by the office and he sacrificed everything [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=7186.4s)]

*  I don't know, we were in the South and it was kind of like, I think I told someone on his tour, [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=7452.4s)]

*  like it's, we could go to jail. Like you could get arrested for that. And for some reason that like, [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=7461.12s)]
*  so Burt can show his nipples, but I can't, like it made me mad and I kind of, and I ended up taking [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=7466.879999999999s)]
*  up my shirt and it was just to make Burt laugh and like make everyone laugh. But it was like, [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=7471.36s)]
*  there was something about it being naughty and being like, it's, first of all, I didn't want [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=7476.08s)]
*  anyone to think I was doing it because I want to like look hot or like want to titillate. I was [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=7481.2s)]

*  and proud and like, sorry if this makes you uncomfortable. Sorry if there are kids here, [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=7500.16s)]
*  look at my fucking tits. And I had a bra on and it was totally covered, but there was something [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=7503.679999999999s)]
*  about like, man, if I wanted to take my shirt off and show my nipples, I couldn't, that's kind of [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=7507.84s)]
*  weird. That is weird to me that like- That's super weird. They, there's like, they've, on TV, [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=7511.04s)]
*  I think there was like a trans person getting top surgery and they like, you know, as they're before [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=7517.12s)]
*  surgery, flat chested, pre-op, they show the whole nipple and everything. The second they put an [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=7523.84s)]
*  implant in, blur, like the second it becomes a woman's tit, not okay. And there's just, and I [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=7529.2s)]
*  get it because it is distracting. Like we don't want to turn men on and like they're, they're, [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=7535.2s)]
*  I'm not, I'm not saying that- But you got to get some tit out there. [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=7542.4s)]
*  But yeah, I really do feel like there's something in me that's like, man, I want to fucking do a [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=7545.04s)]
*  topless special, not because I want to be like, look at my awesome tits, but to be like, [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=7549.2s)]
*  fucking deal with it. And if Burt can do it and it is freeing, it's fun to take your shirt off on [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=7552.96s)]
*  stage. There's something so vulnerable about it. Like we were talking about stripping. There's [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=7558.5599999999995s)]

*  I always, I'm vegan and I post vegan shit all the time. Then I'll say this, that lady did a [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=7604.88s)]
*  fucking good job. Yeah. We're talking about it now. Like it's making it, cause as a vegan, like I, [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=7609.280000000001s)]
*  fucking used to hate vegans. They're so annoying. I thought they always thought they were better [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=7615.36s)]
*  than us. Constantly reminding us of like animal suffering, putting things in your face that you're [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=7618.48s)]
*  like, Jesus Christ. And then one day it fucking worked. They got through. They were annoying [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=7622.8s)]

*  vegans. I used to fucking hate them, resent them. Oh God. And now I'm one of them. And it's because [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=7647.5199999999995s)]

*  it's ironic because I talk into a microphone for a living and no one else can talk. And I make, [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=7678.08s)]
*  make people listen to me, but I'm so scared of people thinking that I'm annoying or that I want [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=7683.6s)]
*  attention or something when clearly I fucking do. I know that's fascinating. Well, it used to be a [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=7688.8s)]
*  different level of manageability before there was social media stuff. It was just like, I'm good at [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=7695.76s)]
*  my craft. Come see me do it. And now every time you put something out, there's a risk that it's [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=7699.76s)]
*  like, maybe they'll see that I'm not, and they won't come see me do what I'm actually good at. [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=7705.84s)]
*  I don't post any standup clips, literally none. I've done three hour specials, four half hour [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=7712.64s)]
*  specials. Like I have hours of standup. I could be all over TikTok. I could kill it with my clips. [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=7718.56s)]
*  I cannot put them out there because I'm scared that they're going to look closely and see I'm [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=7723.6s)]
*  actually not talented. Whereas if you just see trailers for things, or you see pictures of me [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=7727.36s)]
*  doing standup, who knows? I could be the fucking, I know I'm funny. I know I kill I, but then there's [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=7733.04s)]
*  a part of me that thinks I'm a imposter, you know, and that I'm a charlatan, that I'm tricking people. [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=7739.759999999999s)]

*  please just, just think I'm funny. Like don't go analyze it. I do the same thing to comics. Like, [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=7748.88s)]
*  you know, you watch some comics and you go, God, this fucking guy sucks. And look at all his tricks [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=7754.24s)]
*  and you're like, I'm scared of people doing the same thing that I do. I got to work on what I do [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=7758.639999999999s)]
*  in my judgment of people. And then the self and then me worrying about what everyone else thinks [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=7763.04s)]
*  will go away if I stop. Cause I'm just doing, I'm scared of doing, of people doing to me exactly [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=7768.0s)]
*  what I do to them. Damn. Right. Yeah. Look, I appreciate your honesty. Were we ever going to [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=7773.04s)]
*  date? I don't think we ever were. We never even talked about it. No, no. And it's like, [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVWRSrqgaIQ&t=7778.64s)]
