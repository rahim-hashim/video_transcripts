# MrBeast  This Past Weekend w Theo Von #548
**Theo Von - This Past Weekend:** [December 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg)
*  Today's guest is one of the biggest content creators in the world. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=0.0s)]
*  He's an entrepreneur, a YouTube guru, and he has created more energy and excitement [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  into the world of giving back than possibly anyone. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=12.88s)]
*  He has a new show called Beast Games, where a record breaking 1000 people [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=17.52s)]
*  compete for the largest prize in entertainment history, five million dollars. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=22.96s)]
*  Grateful to finally catch up with the one and only Mr. Beast. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=28.56s)]
*  So is this is it already started? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=50.64s)]
*  We go on. Yeah, we'll start right now, man. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=52.04s)]
*  Mr. Beast, Jimmy, nice to see you today. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=54.36s)]
*  Likewise. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=56.32s)]
*  Bro, that's awesome, man. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=56.96s)]
*  So Beast Games, that's the show. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=58.04s)]
*  Yeah. So before this, we were shown on episode one of a show I have coming out [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=59.84s)]
*  December 19th. What do you think of it? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=63.92s)]
*  We watched it and then he started talking. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=65.72s)]
*  His team was like, hit the cameras like, wait, wait, wait. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=67.8s)]
*  Now I'm dying to know what you think. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=70.32s)]
*  Oh, I thought a lot of things, man. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=71.84s)]
*  First of all, I thought that you are obviously you're this wizard of Oz, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=73.88s)]
*  Willy Wonka, kind of William Wallace of finances type of energy going on. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=77.88s)]
*  OK. You know, there's a [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=85.52000000000001s)]
*  lot of that, a lot like I've never seen a show where every. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=86.84s)]
*  I mean, a couple of minutes, there's a there's like another [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=92.92s)]
*  twist of possibility, right? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=97.76s)]
*  Yeah, I kind of realized how many game shows are missing. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=99.76s)]
*  So many little elements in there where they could manipulate the situation more [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=103.2s)]
*  or create more of an environment for like competitors in the game [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=107.56s)]
*  to make choices that would affect them and others, you know? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=111.76s)]
*  Yeah. And like basically having layers and stuff like that. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=115.04s)]
*  But the big thing is no one's ever set up like that many cameras before [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=117.88000000000001s)]
*  because logistical nightmare. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=122.04s)]
*  So it's hard to do these kinds of things normally unscripted because like, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=123.56s)]
*  you know, we had unfathomable amounts of footage, like over 100 years [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=128.6s)]
*  of footage from that episode. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=132.08s)]
*  100 years of footage. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=133.28s)]
*  Yeah, because I mean, we had to have over 100 people work on it and post. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=134.36s)]
*  So it's like to be able to do something at that scale, even just like to set up [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=137.88s)]
*  the cameras and edit and everything is, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=142.12s)]
*  I mean, no one's ever done it before. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=145.44s)]
*  It's diabolical. Yeah. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=146.48000000000002s)]
*  You know, yeah, you said there's a lot of world records that were broken [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=147.84s)]
*  in the in the shooting of the of this series. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=151.52s)]
*  Yeah, 40 Guinness World Records. Wow. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=155.44s)]
*  Yeah. We have like so many plaques now that we have up on our wall. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=157.36s)]
*  I basically making a wall out of Guinness plaques just from the show. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=160.92000000000002s)]
*  What are some of the records you guys broke? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=165.92000000000002s)]
*  Most contestants ever in a show, largest cash prize in a show. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=168.52s)]
*  Most cameras recording at once in a show. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=171.36s)]
*  Most people, which you saw. Yeah. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=173.8s)]
*  And show like most money given away in the first episode of a show. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=176.52s)]
*  Just like stuff like that. Yeah. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=179.72000000000003s)]
*  Oh, that's the most people probably since 9 11, I would think. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=181.04000000000002s)]
*  Oh, my gosh. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=183.60000000000002s)]
*  And we might have to take that out. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=185.24s)]
*  Yeah. And that's it. I shouldn't have said that. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=187.64000000000001s)]
*  I'll say something else. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=189.04000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I haven't seen that many people at the same time. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=190.60000000000002s)]
*  Why was there a cut before you say what you're saying right now? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=193.96s)]
*  Huh? There's this we needed something. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=196.32000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, they use the bathroom. Yeah. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=199.16000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, they try to use the yeah, I already I'd already soiled the conversation. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=201.0s)]
*  Oh, that's the most people at once that I'd seen since. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=205.64000000000001s)]
*  Oh, since I was in the parking lot of a widespread panic concert, you know. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=209.52s)]
*  But that was LSD. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=213.48000000000002s)]
*  That kind of works a little. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=216.4s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's honestly you should keep the first one. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=217.48000000000002s)]
*  You said it. I mean, that's a great point. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=222.64000000000001s)]
*  You make the choices, man. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=224.56s)]
*  Yeah. Do you feel like this wizard like because as I'm watching, I'm like, man, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=226.16s)]
*  there's so many things I'm like, where does the motivation come from? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=230.12s)]
*  Is it to like, do you get so much joy out of like having the manipulation [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=233.04s)]
*  of the situation? Is it giving away the money? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=238.48000000000002s)]
*  Is it because there's so many moments in the world like watching people's feelings [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=241.32s)]
*  change? Yeah. What is it for you that like have you been able to figure out? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=245.16s)]
*  Because you've done so many of these types of competitions [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=248.88s)]
*  and opportunities for people, right? Yeah. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=253.16s)]
*  I mean, this the thing is, I feel like I'm motivated by a lot of things. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=255.92000000000002s)]
*  And these kinds of game shows, it's fun to like create environments [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=259.8s)]
*  that have never been created for and just like, well, let's just see kind of what people do. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=263.6s)]
*  Like a lot of that is just like mass behavioral psychology. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=267.56s)]
*  Like if you offer someone money to eliminate other people, how much money would it take? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=270.40000000000003s)]
*  You know, so it's kind of a little bit of that. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=274.88s)]
*  But it's also I just like making great content and like I like to, you know, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=277.64s)]
*  making things you can't find anywhere else, because it's just fun to like [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=281.24s)]
*  see how the world reacts to it. Yeah. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=284.0s)]
*  And so in this instance, or in a lot of what we do, like we one time [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=286.0s)]
*  we put we just put a big circle on the ground. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=289.68s)]
*  We put 100 people in it and we just were like, whoever leaves last gets half a million dollars. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=292.12s)]
*  And then it's just like, how long does it take? Who's going to leave? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=296.2s)]
*  Like those are the kinds of things I like personally, and just curious on. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=299.96s)]
*  Like what the fuck's going to happen? You know? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=304.0s)]
*  Yeah. What's like one thing you've learned then about people's psychology? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=306.04s)]
*  Have you learned or does it change a lot? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=308.88s)]
*  Like are you learn like are there some general rules you've learned that people will [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=311.04s)]
*  like behave around money or that sort of thing? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=314.92s)]
*  Oh, yeah, that's an interesting question. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=317.44s)]
*  That's I honestly, I feel like people are a lot nicer than you would think. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=319.4s)]
*  Like they're not as they don't tend. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=327.96s)]
*  And maybe it's because when we do it, they know the video is going to be seen by 100 million people. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=332.2s)]
*  So they're they're thinking of their personal image. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=335.8s)]
*  But a lot of times I have given people the opportunity to like screw other people over for some money. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=337.71999999999997s)]
*  And usually they don't take it or they like push like it requires way more money than you would think. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=343.12s)]
*  Like someone who'd theoretically be making thirty thousand dollars a year and you would offer him ten grand. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=348.56s)]
*  But it means this other person gets eliminated or gets punished in the challenge. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=352.64s)]
*  And a lot of times, like they'll say no. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=356.52s)]
*  You know, and I'm like, whoa, that's not an easy decision to make. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=358.8s)]
*  Like there's some integrity here. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=362.32s)]
*  You know, you mentioned that where we're taping that you were surprised about some people's integrity. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=364.12s)]
*  Exactly. Especially during this show, like I sometimes throw large kofi sums of money to eliminate other people, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=367.76s)]
*  to like offer it to certain people. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=374.72s)]
*  And they say no. And I was always just like, what the fuck? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=376.16s)]
*  This is crazy. Is there one age group or gender group or any demographic you can give me on who it seems like [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=379.24s)]
*  after doing a lot of challenges where you've got to see some integrity? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=386.76s)]
*  No, it's pretty this is ten episodes. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=390.64s)]
*  If we watched it all, you would see that. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=394.08s)]
*  Yeah, you would see that it's like pretty widespread across the board. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=396.04s)]
*  I mean, maybe the senior citizen, some seniors can't make it through that. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=399.16s)]
*  You saw that one 70 year old, she passed, which is she passed away. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=404.76000000000005s)]
*  No, passed the challenge. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=408.04s)]
*  Oh, God. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=409.64000000000004s)]
*  I hope she doesn't pass away before the show airs. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=410.44s)]
*  That would be bad. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=413.0s)]
*  No, I don't think people, some seniors, I don't know if I would let one of my grandparents watch this. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=414.6s)]
*  Just the levels of. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=419.08000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, your heart beating. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=420.52000000000004s)]
*  There's a lot. Yeah. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=421.48s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I was going for. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=422.28000000000003s)]
*  What I really wanted is like in my YouTube videos, sometimes people say they don't have enough emotion or they lack the storytelling or whatever. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=423.56s)]
*  Part of it is like it's just YouTube. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=430.91999999999996s)]
*  When you go to like a streaming platform like Amazon Prime Video or Netflix, you're like sitting down to watch something usually for like hours and you're to watch like this longer story and show. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=433.0s)]
*  But when you go to YouTube, more than likely, like you're going there for a quicker hit, you're not sitting down expecting to watch a 10 episode series, like you're just clicking on videos and watching. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=443.08s)]
*  So content put up on YouTube is just different. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=452.2s)]
*  It's like series don't do as well. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=455.0s)]
*  And so it's much easier to build characters and feel emotion over these 10 episodes, six hours of content than it is in a 20 minute video because you have like 10 minutes to build them up. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=457.24s)]
*  But then you got to wind the story down because the video is going to end in 10 minutes. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=466.12s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=468.68s)]
*  So my big thing here was like I really wanted you to feel something and I wanted to like flex those muscles and like actually build characters and like give emotion and things like that. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=469.40000000000003s)]
*  Like when we were watching that, even though I've already seen it like 100 times already, I could feel my heart pounding. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=480.36s)]
*  I mean, or it might have been the Celsius I was drinking. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=485.08s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=486.92s)]
*  But like I really could feel the emotion. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=487.24s)]
*  That's what I want. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=490.2s)]
*  Like when people watch the show, I want them to have very intense feelings. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=491.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I definitely did, man. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=495.24s)]
*  And the interesting thing to me, too, is like a lot of times with game shows and it's the contestants that you start to get to know. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=497.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=505.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=505.72s)]
*  But with this, it's not the contestants like. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=505.96000000000004s)]
*  Well, you will later on, but because there's a thousand of them, first I got to lay down the hammer, 900 of them or whatever, and then we can build them up. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=508.6s)]
*  I see. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=517.32s)]
*  And I definitely learned why no one ever does stuff with a thousand because that's the most contestants ever. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=518.0400000000001s)]
*  It's a lot to like just everything is a thousand hotel rooms a night. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=523.48s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=528.84s)]
*  If the hotel room is $200, that's $200,000 a night and just hotel rooms and you're feeding them. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=529.4s)]
*  Even like every little thing is so expensive when you times it by a thousand and then like to record a thousand people, you need a thousand cameras just to buy a thousand cameras is a bitch. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=534.6800000000001s)]
*  And then to hook all the cameras up to the server, we need like 56 miles of cable to run it over there. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=544.84s)]
*  And then you need like 250 camera people to check in on them. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=550.28s)]
*  And so it's like, I know why people don't do reality shows at this scale because it's so fucking expensive. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=553.72s)]
*  What was the total budget of this show? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=561.96s)]
*  Can you I want to tell you about it. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=564.1999999999999s)]
*  Can you just believe it? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=566.76s)]
*  So it doesn't make it in for sure. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=567.56s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=569.0s)]
*  Can we believe it in some artistic way? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=569.24s)]
*  So at least it looks exciting. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=570.84s)]
*  No, just be like, what the fuck? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=572.28s)]
*  Or do this? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=574.04s)]
*  Sure. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=575.72s)]
*  Put that over my mouth. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=575.9599999999999s)]
*  We spent. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=577.72s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=579.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=580.84s)]
*  I hope my mom's all right. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=581.16s)]
*  I didn't mean it. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=586.68s)]
*  Don't cancel me. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=587.3199999999999s)]
*  No, I'm just trying to give some different. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=588.04s)]
*  Try to get some different reactions. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=591.24s)]
*  Put that in the intro. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=592.68s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=593.8s)]
*  You spent that much on this? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=595.2399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, because it gets crazy. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=596.92s)]
*  Like that first one, we built a thousand towers and those are real towers that have actual hydraulic press doors that are have to be safety proof with giant foam and crash pad at the bottom with the light system. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=598.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=610.5999999999999s)]
*  Because we're turning them red and green and then we had to build custom software to connect it all where you press the button and the lights change. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=610.76s)]
*  And then we had to rig like I told you a thousand cameras in there to a giant control center. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=616.9200000000001s)]
*  Like just that first episode alone was, I mean, crazy, man. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=621.8000000000001s)]
*  And do you have to take it all down at the end? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=624.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=626.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=627.0s)]
*  I didn't. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=627.4s)]
*  I don't own that building. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=627.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=629.08s)]
*  Because the problem is like we needed six massive hangers. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=629.48s)]
*  So like we basically in Canada, there's like these six giant airport hangers and we were just like, hey, can we use those and converted them all to these big sets and then right outside as a field. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=634.12s)]
*  And that's where we built that city, which was also. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=644.2s)]
*  So I have in this field at one point, I have like 800 people working over here just building a city in the middle of a field. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=646.6s)]
*  And I've got like 600 construction people in these six hangers just building these other sets and then I have all these. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=652.28s)]
*  I mean, at some points we had like over 2000 people on set just in this town in Canada. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=657.32s)]
*  So it was crazy. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=662.84s)]
*  Were you employing just a lot of locals? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=664.12s)]
*  I mean, just you were just you would just set up you would put out the employment opportunities in advance. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=665.64s)]
*  Yeah, we worked with two different unions and then, yeah, we hired a bunch of people locally and things like that. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=670.2s)]
*  So, yeah, it created a lot of jobs locally there. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=675.4s)]
*  And where does your joy come from? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=677.72s)]
*  Like because you give away you've given away a lot of money, right? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=679.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=682.12s)]
*  You give away a lot of joy while I'm watching. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=682.36s)]
*  Like there's something also like there's moments in there as I'm watching them like, oh, what would I do in that instance? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=684.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=689.16s)]
*  That comes into my head. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=689.3199999999999s)]
*  And then you see the reactions if somebody screws somebody over and you see the reaction if somebody is get screwed over and you kind of think like, OK, well, what feeling would I want to have? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=690.28s)]
*  You know, and then like in the moment, you're like, oh, yeah, I would definitely take the money. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=699.96s)]
*  But then right now, looking back, when I start to even think about some of those moments, I'd be like, man, it must have been really tough to leave and have those people feel. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=703.64s)]
*  And so maybe I wouldn't have. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=710.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=711.88s)]
*  It's just it's interesting. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=712.04s)]
*  This is a view where all the little moments that I kind of navigate and then kind of learn about myself. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=713.24s)]
*  But what do you get like like you give away so much money. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=718.1999999999999s)]
*  Do you feel like you're like making up for something in a past life or like, is there something that like you didn't grow up with a lot of money? [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=721.16s)]
*  You know, no. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=728.4399999999999s)]
*  And so was it do you like when you think back on little moments like did you see somebody give some money once and it made you feel excited or like are you able to connect any of those dots as you get a little bit older and have a breath of time? [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=729.4000000000001s)]
*  You know, that's where I I should come up with this, you know, heart throbbing story of like, I just want to, you know, help people because I couldn't when I was younger or whatever. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=741.48s)]
*  But the honest truth is like I know how to make content go viral. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=751.72s)]
*  We're really good at making good content. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=756.0400000000001s)]
*  And I just believe a world where I help people is just more fun than a world there where I don't. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=758.0400000000001s)]
*  And that's kind of really it. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=762.84s)]
*  I just I've noticed where, you know, videos where we do help people or give away money, I tend to just be a little happier, enjoy it a little bit more. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=764.84s)]
*  And so I just lean more that way. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=771.96s)]
*  That's cool. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=773.4000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that's the truth. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=775.0s)]
*  I mean, I could I could one time for fun because like everyone has these like PR publicists and PR people. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=776.2s)]
*  I just talked to one. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=782.2s)]
*  I was like, huh, what advice would you have for me? [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=783.72s)]
*  And they're like, you need to come up with a better story and why you help people. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=785.64s)]
*  And I was like, well, what I because this is what I usually say. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=788.6s)]
*  It's like, well, the truth is, it just is slightly more fun than what I don't. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=791.4s)]
*  They're like, no, you need to come up with a better one. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=794.92s)]
*  Like, you know, like you are saying, like, you know, say like you helped a homeless person and brought you immense joy and all this stuff. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=796.92s)]
*  And I was just like, yeah, that feels kind of fake. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=802.76s)]
*  Yeah. So yeah, that's yes. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=804.76s)]
*  And I guess that's the truth. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=806.68s)]
*  It is. And it's a very simple truth. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=808.68s)]
*  Yeah, I like helping somebody out. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=810.4399999999999s)]
*  It's just more fun than if I don't. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=812.12s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=813.96s)]
*  Yeah, it's scary to think that, though, like recently I was given giving some money to some people that had been suffered from a storm, right? [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=815.3199999999999s)]
*  From some flooding and but and I'm not saying that to make myself look exciting or anything, but it was nothing like this. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=823.0s)]
*  And if they see that and then hear what I get, they're like, oh, this is this guy's. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=830.1999999999999s)]
*  Well, I mean, this is just our reality show. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=833.56s)]
*  But yeah, in general, I don't know if you've watched too many of our videos, but we built 100 wells in Africa. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=835.4s)]
*  We oh, yeah, I know you. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=839.56s)]
*  Yeah, you guys have given you stuff. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=841.72s)]
*  You've taken plastics out of the ocean. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=843.0s)]
*  Yeah, but what the the wealth stuff, that one was interesting or really eye opening for me because we were one of them. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=845.5600000000001s)]
*  Like we went like four hours into the middle of nowhere and you're like, you know, in places where these people don't have the Internet like they're I mean, really intense poverty. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=851.88s)]
*  And it's like it's pretty eye opening. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=859.96s)]
*  I would recommend if anyone ever has an opportunity to like just work on a project or do something places like that. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=862.36s)]
*  It's like crazy to think that we're on the same planet, you know what I mean? [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=867.8s)]
*  And yeah, who like don't even have access to clean water and have to walk an hour every morning to go to a river to get water. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=872.28s)]
*  But then you look upstream and there's literally cows shitting in that same water that they're drinking out of because that's like that's the world they live in. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=879.4s)]
*  And like we have anyways, I don't know. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=886.3599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, no, look, no, I think putting things in a perspective, right, changes things for people. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=888.3599999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=893.0799999999999s)]
*  Did you have to like kind of achieve a certain amount of finances before you were able to start giving away finances? [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=894.1999999999999s)]
*  No, I've always like my first brand deal was ten thousand dollars and I just walked outside and gave it to a homeless person. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=899.9599999999999s)]
*  So I've just always done it because it's just like, you know, if I do this, then hopefully this video makes fifteen thousand dollars and then I'll give away fifteen thousand dollars. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=906.1999999999999s)]
*  And then hopefully that video makes twenty thousand dollars and I'll give away twenty. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=914.92s)]
*  And so I just had that idea of where I was like, what if I just give away the money and then it makes more money and I give that away? [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=917.4000000000001s)]
*  And then I've just kind of been doing that for like eight years. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=923.5600000000001s)]
*  And now you're at five million dollars, which is the largest amount that has ever been given away in a game show or in a reality show in any show. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=926.5200000000001s)]
*  Really? No one's ever given away. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=932.6800000000001s)]
*  I think Squid Game was the most of four million five hundred sixty thousand. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=933.96s)]
*  Wow. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=936.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=937.4000000000001s)]
*  Did you want to beat that kind of? [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=937.6400000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=938.84s)]
*  That's why the number is five million. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=939.5600000000001s)]
*  But we also gave away like, you know, another fifteen plus million on top of that just throughout the show. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=941.6400000000001s)]
*  No, I love it because you hear so many companies that companies that just like it's about their bottom. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=946.52s)]
*  And it's like this is like the opposite of that. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=950.76s)]
*  It's like, let's do something good and let's make a bunch of money. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=952.84s)]
*  But then let's let's give it away. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=956.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=958.28s)]
*  It's like the opposite of like all the other treacherous type of capitalism that you hear about, you know? [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=958.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=965.4s)]
*  I mean, it's interesting because now that I've done like a streaming show or whatever, it's like a lot of these shows, their cash prize is like two hundred fifty thousand dollars, five hundred thousand dollars. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=965.72s)]
*  It's like I wonder why they don't give away more. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=976.52s)]
*  I mean, I can watch this whole, you know, ten episode show just to see who wins two hundred fifty K and it's like the first three minutes of our show, we gave away a million dollars. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=979.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=988.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=989.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=990.12s)]
*  So it'll be interesting. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=990.92s)]
*  I'm curious to see how people react to it because just anyways, you're going to make other. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=992.04s)]
*  Yeah, dude, we had a dude. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=996.12s)]
*  He would give you ten bucks to look at his butt. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=998.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1001.24s)]
*  Wait, what? [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1001.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1002.1999999999999s)]
*  When I was, you know, when I was younger than I am now, for sure. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1002.4399999999999s)]
*  He was a child. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1005.64s)]
*  I don't want to say a child, but you just pretend I was a child. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1006.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1009.24s)]
*  Because I was and this guy would give you ten bucks to look at his butt. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1009.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1013.3199999999999s)]
*  Not up close, far away, you know, but it was like so, yeah, I could have given us a lot more. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1013.56s)]
*  Do you need to file a police report? [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1019.64s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1021.88s)]
*  But I'm just saying it's like everybody has a game show and you're like, yeah, people, these these prizes are cheap. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1023.64s)]
*  You know, that's what it was. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1029.32s)]
*  Kind of what I was getting at anyway. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1030.28s)]
*  We can take that. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1031.8799999999999s)]
*  So you were on a game show and a guy gave you ten dollars to look at his butt. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1032.52s)]
*  We had a dude in our area. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1036.2s)]
*  I'll be honest with you. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1037.24s)]
*  He gave you ten dollars. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1038.04s)]
*  He'd walk off a little bit. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1039.08s)]
*  He kind of spread his butt a little bit and you had to kind of go like that at him and you got the money. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1040.12s)]
*  You know. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1044.76s)]
*  Okay. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1045.96s)]
*  So but it wasn't it wasn't close up and it wasn't even super invasive. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1046.52s)]
*  It was like, you know, I get it's. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1049.72s)]
*  How old were you at the time? [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1052.2s)]
*  I was old enough to be like, hey, this guy's kind of a crazy guy, you know, but he's also cheap. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1055.8s)]
*  You know, they're probably 13, 12, 11. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1061.16s)]
*  Oh, gosh. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1063.4s)]
*  You know. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1064.12s)]
*  But anyway, you sure you don't want to file a police report? [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1064.84s)]
*  You sure you don't want to take care of that? [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1068.68s)]
*  He's not currently still offering 12 year olds ten dollars. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1072.28s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1075.56s)]
*  But because you might want to put it into that. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1076.04s)]
*  Yeah, you're right, actually. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1078.2s)]
*  And maybe that's the type of game we can go to do next is trapping guys like that. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1079.32s)]
*  You know, twelve dollar butt games. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1083.08s)]
*  That's different. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1085.56s)]
*  Anyway, I shouldn't have said anything like that. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1087.08s)]
*  Just so our viewers know, right, I know you have the largest YouTube channel [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1090.6s)]
*  that exists, the most that they can have on there. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1094.84s)]
*  You have more subscribers than I think people in America. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1098.36s)]
*  Yeah, I haven't thought of that. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1103.6399999999999s)]
*  But yeah, population of America. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1104.76s)]
*  I think it's hard to cut you off to me like 300 million, right? [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1106.28s)]
*  Almost four. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1109.32s)]
*  Oh, it's almost four. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1110.12s)]
*  Is it the same American population? [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1111.0s)]
*  Three thirty four. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1113.8s)]
*  Oh, yeah, we're about the same. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1114.44s)]
*  We're at three thirty. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1115.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so we're we're tied with America. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1116.44s)]
*  Yeah, I guess it's I mean, I it's crazy, man. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1119.0s)]
*  Like eight years ago, I was in high school. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1123.7199999999998s)]
*  So it's kind of funny when I think about it, because eight years ago, I'm raising my hand [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1125.7199999999998s)]
*  to ask you the bathroom. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1128.76s)]
*  And then, yeah, I guess now we have the same subscribers as America. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1129.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, it's pretty. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1132.84s)]
*  Yeah, that's a difference. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1134.6s)]
*  Pretty wild how it happens. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1135.6399999999999s)]
*  It's a it's a lot, man. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1136.6799999999998s)]
*  You know, what's interesting because you're you talk about like the large subscriber count [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1139.0s)]
*  is it's like when I had like 10 million subscribers, I had like 10 million subscribers. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1143.0s)]
*  I was like, I thought this is fame. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1148.52s)]
*  Like this is, you know, like I would go to Walmart and I don't know, maybe one person [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1151.0s)]
*  would ask for a photo and it's like, this is fucking cool. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1155.72s)]
*  This is what it's like. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1157.8799999999999s)]
*  But, you know, there's just like such a big difference where and this is not obvious, [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1159.16s)]
*  but where I'm at now than when I had like 10 million subscribers or where it was like [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1164.2s)]
*  four years ago. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1167.72s)]
*  And it's it keeps getting crazier every year and every year. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1168.68s)]
*  Like like people will follow my car to like, you know, if I'm out and they see me, they'll [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1172.2s)]
*  like try to stalk me so they can see where I live. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1178.12s)]
*  Like, you know, that's like that kind of stuff didn't happen four years ago or almost anything [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1179.96s)]
*  I do ends up on the Internet. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1185.3999999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1187.56s)]
*  Like one time I was like at a drive every time I go to a drive, it's like flipping a [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1187.8799999999999s)]
*  coin on whether or not 10 like someone's gonna go, Mr. Beast. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1193.08s)]
*  And then all the people in the background run to the window and it's going to be this [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1195.8799999999999s)]
*  thing that's, you know, kind of intense. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1198.76s)]
*  Or if it's just like a really, really old person. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1201.24s)]
*  And I'm like always super happy when like I pull up to a drive through and it sounds [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1204.28s)]
*  like they're 50 because I'm like, fuck yeah, I'm good. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1207.64s)]
*  But if they if they sound like they're in their 20s or 30s, it's brutal because then [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1210.0400000000002s)]
*  it's like one time someone did that. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1213.96s)]
*  They opened it. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1217.0s)]
*  She was like, you're Mr. Beast. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1217.64s)]
*  I was like, yeah. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1219.0800000000002s)]
*  And she goes to whip out her phone. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1219.5600000000002s)]
*  I was like, hey, I don't want people to know what I'm driving. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1220.68s)]
*  Like we can chat, but just please no photos because then if it goes viral, I'm gonna have [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1223.0s)]
*  to sell this car. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1226.92s)]
*  And like it's just a lot of work. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1227.64s)]
*  And she's like, OK. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1229.0800000000002s)]
*  And then she goes to get the food and she comes back and there's just I see just 10 [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1230.6000000000001s)]
*  other people that work. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1235.5600000000002s)]
*  I won't even say the restaurant behind her coming up or their phones recording. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1236.6s)]
*  I was like, I thought I could trust you. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1240.12s)]
*  And I had to drive off before they handed me my food because I was like, if I don't, [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1242.6s)]
*  they're going to start filming people to see the car drive, blah, blah, blah. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1246.76s)]
*  And then it's funny. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1249.3999999999999s)]
*  Like the next day I see on Reddit, Mr. Beast is an asshole, just drove off. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1250.6799999999998s)]
*  And it's like, no, you forgot to tell the part where I was like, hey, please don't [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1256.12s)]
*  tax my car. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1260.28s)]
*  Yeah, you know, just come to me. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1261.08s)]
*  He leaves that whole thing out. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1262.6799999999998s)]
*  And so there's a lot of that. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1263.8s)]
*  Or another time I was at a restaurant, I don't even know who I was with, but someone [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1265.6399999999999s)]
*  paid for my food. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1270.28s)]
*  And I was like, when I asked for the bill, they're like, oh, someone paid for it. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1271.56s)]
*  They're like told me to tell you they like your videos. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1276.04s)]
*  I was like, cool. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1277.96s)]
*  How do I tip? [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1279.08s)]
*  And they're like, well, we don't have a bill. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1279.8799999999999s)]
*  And I was like, OK. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1281.48s)]
*  So I just laughed. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1282.36s)]
*  And then the next day I see on the Internet, Mr. Beast stiffed me and didn't leave a tip [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1283.3999999999999s)]
*  or whatever. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1287.08s)]
*  And it's like someone paid for my meal. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1287.96s)]
*  I didn't get a bill. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1290.52s)]
*  It's not like I carry cash. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1291.8s)]
*  So and I was just so I have so many instances like that where like no one gives a fuck [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1293.72s)]
*  when you're smaller about all these little things. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1298.92s)]
*  But like as I've gotten bigger, yeah, it's just like every interaction, it's like a 10% [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1300.6s)]
*  chance this thing's going to end up on the Internet and they're going to try to twist [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1307.56s)]
*  things or whatever. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1311.16s)]
*  And it's just gotten crazier. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1312.6s)]
*  Like people, like I said, follow me or. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1314.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's interesting. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1317.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1318.52s)]
*  And you get well, you get to a point also of popularity where you've also gone. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1318.76s)]
*  You can't go back. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1322.28s)]
*  First of all, you can't on beast yourself. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1324.12s)]
*  Actually, I can't abuse myself if I were a beanie. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1327.0s)]
*  I've noticed like I've tried all sorts of outfits when I fly to see which ones get rid. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1329.3999999999999s)]
*  If I put my bangs and a beanie and put that on because I've never worn anything like that [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1333.3999999999999s)]
*  my videos, the amount of photos I take go down like crazy. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1336.76s)]
*  Wow. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1339.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1340.2s)]
*  So it's like and then if I combo the beanie with like a pair of glasses, because I also [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1340.44s)]
*  have never worn glasses in my videos, it takes it down. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1345.08s)]
*  So I've like studied it. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1347.8s)]
*  Because like I used to just rock a hood, but that's kind of like suspicious. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1349.48s)]
*  It's like especially in places where it's not cold. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1353.64s)]
*  Yeah, it's like a bank robber, but he's at United Airlines. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1355.88s)]
*  Makes them like double look. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1359.3200000000002s)]
*  And they're like, oh, shit. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1360.44s)]
*  So the hood strap doesn't work. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1362.2s)]
*  But the beanie glasses strap, that's that's the key. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1364.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1367.0800000000002s)]
*  If you want to be like low key. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1367.3200000000002s)]
*  Yeah, no, I think there's different ways to do different little disguises. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1369.0800000000002s)]
*  I do think it's interesting what you're saying, though, like about like I would notice. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1372.6000000000001s)]
*  This is just for me, but I would notice like someone would pay for my food sometime at [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1376.52s)]
*  a restaurant. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1380.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1381.4799999999998s)]
*  But then I would read like, oh, he didn't thank us for it. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1381.7199999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1384.6799999999998s)]
*  So really, they were paying for it. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1384.9199999999998s)]
*  So I would like engage with them. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1387.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1389.32s)]
*  Which is it's OK. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1389.4799999999998s)]
*  But it's like at some point, it's like maybe I'm due with. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1391.08s)]
*  I'd rather just pay for the food. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1394.12s)]
*  Yeah, I'd rather just pay for my food. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1395.24s)]
*  I didn't know that there was this other exchange to it. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1396.4399999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1398.9199999999998s)]
*  So I'm not complaining. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1399.24s)]
*  I'm happy for the extra food. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1400.1999999999998s)]
*  But if I'm in a hurry or something and now I'm in a different spot and now I'm in a conversation [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1401.7199999999998s)]
*  where somebody also then wants to ask you about a business thing or something, it's like, [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1405.96s)]
*  yeah, you know, there's no rule book for these kinds of things. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1409.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1412.4399999999998s)]
*  There's no rule book. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1412.6s)]
*  So you kind of have to like learn on the go. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1413.3999999999999s)]
*  Like, what do I do when random people pay for my food? [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1415.72s)]
*  Oh, I guess this is the random people paid for my food etiquette. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1419.1599999999999s)]
*  I have to stand there and demand a bill from the waitress five times until they give it. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1422.4399999999998s)]
*  So I can tip. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1426.9199999999998s)]
*  I then have to walk around the restaurant and find who paid for it and think these are [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1427.8799999999999s)]
*  the things that you just kind of have to learn as you get more famous. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1432.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1436.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1436.52s)]
*  Well, it's just interesting. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1436.76s)]
*  You know, people will be like, oh, famous people complaining, you know, but it's like, [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1437.9599999999998s)]
*  but if somebody if popularity is a blessing and a curse and sometimes it's a side effect [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1441.7199999999998s)]
*  of what you even wanted to do. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1446.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1447.7199999999998s)]
*  And yeah. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1449.08s)]
*  And then there's also ways to like little things to navigate amongst it. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1449.4799999999998s)]

*  You know, were you at a point where you were just a beast? [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1753.64s)]
*  Yeah, so when I was probably 13 or 11, you know, Xbox Live, I just was randomized in the name [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1758.6s)]
*  and it gave me like the name Mr. Beast 6000. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1765.8s)]
*  And so that was just like my Xbox gamertag when I was playing Call of Duty. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1768.12s)]
*  So they gave you that? [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1770.9199999999998s)]
*  Did they ever come after you and try to claim any title to it? [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1771.48s)]
*  Well, no, because it's just like a random name generator and they don't own it. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1774.84s)]
*  But then, so then when I started a YouTube channel, I just called it Mr. Beast 6000. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1777.72s)]
*  And then everyone was just like, why is this 6000? [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1781.6399999999999s)]
*  I was like, I don't know. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1785.3999999999999s)]
*  And then I eventually just dropped it and there's Mr. Beast. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1786.2s)]
*  So that's kind of how it came about. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1788.9199999999998s)]
*  But in terms of how I got where I am now, I started making videos when I was 11. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1790.36s)]
*  Had no fucking clue what I was doing. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1795.8s)]
*  They were absolute trash. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1797.08s)]
*  And then no one watched when I was 11. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1798.36s)]
*  No one watched when I was 12. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1801.32s)]
*  No one watched when I was 13. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1802.28s)]
*  No one watched when I was 14. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1803.32s)]
*  No one watched when I was 15. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1804.44s)]
*  And then I started to get like, holy fuck, is anyone ever going to watch these? [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1805.96s)]
*  I'm like four years in. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1809.32s)]
*  I'm like having depressive mental breakdowns because I'm poor and everything I have. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1811.08s)]
*  But I mean, like at the time, you know, obviously everyone thinks the videos I make are great. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1814.84s)]
*  And I thought I was making like insanely great videos, but they're just trash. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1819.08s)]
*  I just and like the problem is I didn't have anyone to teach me how to edit. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1822.36s)]
*  So I'm like learning on my own. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1825.96s)]
*  I didn't know anything about cameras, didn't know anything about anything. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1827.56s)]
*  And then 16, no one's watching them. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1830.28s)]
*  17, no one watching them. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1831.8799999999999s)]
*  And I'm like, fuck, I just like I only my whole life was just like, I just want to do YouTube. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1833.24s)]
*  I need to make enough money by the time I graduate high school so I can do this. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1837.8799999999999s)]
*  Or I'm fucked because like I didn't have good grades or anything. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1841.8799999999999s)]
*  And, you know, he didn't have much money because my parents were over leveraged in 2008. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1844.44s)]
*  They're in the army, bought some properties 2008. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1849.08s)]
*  And then the recession or financial crisis hit, went bankrupt, lost everything. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1851.32s)]
*  So like my mom was also like, fuck, my son's just going to be homeless. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1855.8799999999999s)]
*  Get back in there. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1861.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, like just going to be homeless. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1861.72s)]
*  And she she hates it. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1863.08s)]
*  And and so I finally 18, about to graduate high school. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1864.4399999999998s)]
*  Still no one watches the videos. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1869.3999999999999s)]
*  No one gives a fuck. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1870.6s)]
*  I'm making graduation night. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1871.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I remember like, yeah, it's just like my mom's like, all right, it's time to accept reality. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1873.56s)]
*  Got to go to community college, got to get a degree. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1879.4s)]
*  And I was just like, I didn't want to. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1881.88s)]
*  But I was like, OK, let me just pick the easiest, lamest fucking degree. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1883.8000000000002s)]
*  I think it was like some communications to get my local community. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1886.2s)]
*  Zoning is one of them. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1888.8400000000001s)]
*  But then two weeks into it, I just like, fuck this shit. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1890.0400000000002s)]
*  And so every day, because I didn't have enough money to move out, I just go to college. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1894.2800000000002s)]
*  But then I would just work on videos in my car. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1898.76s)]
*  And I was just like, OK, in six months, my mom's going to find out that I have straight zeros. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1900.3600000000001s)]
*  Kick me out of the house. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1904.92s)]
*  I got to get it where people are watching my videos enough or I can like live off of it over the next six months. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1905.72s)]
*  And then I just started doing a bunch of stupid stuff like around this time when I counted to 100,000. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1911.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's so classic. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1916.28s)]
*  And a lot of other things like that. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1917.48s)]
*  And I watched somebody semi unconscious count their way through like the 80,000 is unbelievable. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1919.16s)]
*  Yeah, it was. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1924.6000000000001s)]
*  There's one part I think at 93,000 where I was like 92,999, 91,000. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1926.44s)]
*  I actually went backwards. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1931.8s)]
*  I didn't realize it. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1932.68s)]
*  And then I just went 91,001, 91,002. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1933.32s)]
*  So I like it. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1935.8799999999999s)]
*  Yes, because I was so just out of it at that point. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1937.08s)]
*  Yeah, there are other moments in that where you're like, yeah, somebody help this guy or something. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1939.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1943.6399999999999s)]
*  But anyways, around that point, I had a month where I made 20 grand. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1944.28s)]
*  And then I was like, Mom, I have straight zeros. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1947.0s)]
*  I'll move out tomorrow. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1950.2s)]
*  And then it's moved out. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1950.9199999999998s)]
*  So that and then, yeah, then we just kept reinvesting it all. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1951.8s)]
*  And here we are. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1954.9199999999998s)]
*  So it's like a 15 year journey. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1955.3999999999999s)]
*  And it's been pretty crazy. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1957.56s)]
*  Was it hard to learn to reinvest in yourself? [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1959.24s)]
*  Is that like a I know you kind of mentioned a minute ago. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1961.24s)]
*  Was that like a thing? [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1964.44s)]
*  Is it hard to learn to reinvest? [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1965.4s)]
*  No, for me, it always came natural because like I have a well now it's a little bit crazier [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1966.68s)]
*  because we're traveling everything. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1971.8s)]
*  But back then, I lived in a place that was $720 a month and I split it with someone. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1972.68s)]
*  So I needed 360 for rent. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1976.2s)]
*  And I had like a 2005 Dodge Durango, which was that expensive. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1978.28s)]
*  So it was like, OK, $1,000 to cover my expenses. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1981.48s)]
*  Everything else just pour back in. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1984.92s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1986.2s)]
*  So if you just live below your means, then it allows you just to go crazy and throw everything [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1986.76s)]
*  back into it. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1992.2s)]
*  And I just was like a fucking machine back then that lived to make the best videos possible. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1992.8400000000001s)]
*  And so every dollar was just a way to just make a better video. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=1997.3200000000002s)]
*  Wow. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2002.1200000000001s)]
*  So you want to make the best video. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2002.6000000000001s)]
*  There's something about it that you want to make the best video. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2004.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2008.2s)]
*  Well, it's I've obviously studied the algorithm, studied the tens of thousands of YouTube videos. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2008.44s)]
*  I'm a data nerd. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2013.3200000000002s)]
*  And what's interesting is the data always just shows that the better a video is, the [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2014.6s)]
*  more views it gets. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2018.84s)]
*  It's like if people watch it and enjoy it, YouTube gives it more views. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2019.56s)]
*  So it's like, yeah, it's the better. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2023.0s)]
*  That's what took us from 100,000 views a video to a million to 10 million views a video to 20 [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2026.1999999999998s)]
*  to 40 to 50 to 100. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2030.36s)]
*  It's just people notice when you put in the effort and go above and beyond. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2031.8799999999999s)]
*  So they just keep coming back. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2036.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2037.48s)]
*  I mean, that we are watching. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2037.7199999999998s)]
*  I mean, I know this will be on Amazon, right? [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2039.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2041.32s)]
*  Prime Video, the beast game thing. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2041.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2043.08s)]
*  But watching some of your stuff is just like, man, this is like fantastical. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2043.32s)]
*  You know, it's like fantasy. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2047.96s)]
*  There's fantasy parts of it. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2049.4s)]
*  What was one you guys just put up about? [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2052.04s)]
*  You went out into these like this cave and seven days in the underground cave. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2053.24s)]
*  Is that a was it a real cave or not a real? [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2058.68s)]
*  So we did seven days in a cave and seven days in underground city. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2061.0s)]
*  Which one? [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2063.64s)]
*  Underground city. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2064.12s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2064.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, that's in Romania. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2065.0s)]
*  That's that was crazy. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2066.6s)]
*  It was so great because it's like it's mixes like past and present. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2067.96s)]
*  It's like I can't it's like are we the Mayans or the aliens here? [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2071.16s)]
*  There's this mix of like, you know, where is this a real city? [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2076.04s)]
*  Is it not? [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2079.7999999999997s)]
*  It looks brand new, but then it's also has the Romans used to mine salt out of there. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2080.2799999999997s)]
*  I think it was like something crazy, like 2 billion pounds of salt have been mined there. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2085.24s)]
*  There's something ridiculous. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2091.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2092.68s)]
*  So it's been used for over a thousand years and then they built a little underground city [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2092.8399999999997s)]
*  there and there's a ferris wheel and everything. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2097.08s)]
*  It's so mind blowing that like how there's a. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2098.7599999999998s)]

*  Yeah, in that underground city. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2102.04s)]
*  That's a part that that's one that it's just like I can't tell sometimes when it's new [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2103.4s)]
*  or older. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2107.64s)]

*  You know, that's what it feels like to me. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2110.52s)]
*  It felt like dang. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2111.8s)]

*  Yeah, I'm like I have scars on my forehead from I was so I was an acne up freak that [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2154.9199999999996s)]
*  just obsessed over YouTube. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2159.24s)]
*  I don't I know how to talk to a woman like if they were like, hi, I'd probably just be like, [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2161.16s)]

*  No, no, I mean, but it kind of worked to my advantage a little bit because that's why I [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2169.24s)]
*  just grinded so much from 11 to 18, which most people probably would have been trying [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2173.9599999999996s)]

*  day. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2185.7999999999997s)]

*  Do you know Accutane? [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2187.56s)]

*  I mean, it's a pretty intense thing, but I took Accutane and it just got rid of all my [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2198.2799999999997s)]

*  going on in places of them all where they weren't supposed to getting in locked doors. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2554.4399999999996s)]
*  And the line and crowd was getting so big, they made us end it early and leave, which [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2557.9599999999996s)]
*  was annoying because like I felt bad because so many people showed up and I just wanted [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2561.4s)]
*  to at least like wave and say hi to a lot of them. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2565.96s)]
*  And then, yeah, I met a lot of the biggest Indian creators over there and super cool [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2569.2400000000002s)]
*  film some stuff. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2574.76s)]
*  Wow. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2575.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, we just we what was also interesting is we did this meet and greet with a bunch [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2576.28s)]
*  of Bollywood actors like their kids and just said hi to them. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2583.0s)]
*  And I've just never watched any Bollywood films. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2586.6800000000003s)]
*  So I was just hanging out, saying hi to some of these people. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2590.04s)]
*  And I took a photo with this kid and one parent. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2593.0s)]
*  And then one of the guys beside me who just works there was like, hey, do you know who [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2595.4s)]
*  that guy is? [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2600.44s)]
*  It's this. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2600.84s)]
*  And he showed me like an Instagram account. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2601.24s)]
*  He had like 60 million followers. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2602.52s)]
*  I was like, no. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2603.72s)]
*  He's like, oh, that was the guy I just met. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2604.36s)]
*  He's like, yeah, it's like, oh, cool. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2606.12s)]
*  And then I took a photo and said hi to another kid with his mom. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2607.56s)]
*  And he's like the guy was like, she is she's like in these movies and like this and he [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2611.64s)]
*  was like freaking out. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2615.72s)]
*  And I was like, and I didn't know any of these people. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2616.6s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2618.44s)]
*  So I was like, OK, now I need you to tell me who they are before they walk up. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2619.16s)]
*  And so you'd like it's just this random guy I just met. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2622.6s)]
*  And he's just like, OK, here's here's this person's Instagram account. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2625.88s)]
*  It'd be like 30 million followers. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2628.36s)]
*  Apparently, there's like twice as many people use Instagram in India than in USA. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2629.64s)]
*  So I didn't know any of this. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2634.12s)]
*  But like, it's a really good. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2635.48s)]
*  You forget about that. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2636.52s)]
*  And just how many people there are. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2637.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2638.44s)]
*  And and TikTok's banned in India. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2638.7599999999998s)]
*  So that makes more people use Instagram. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2641.4s)]
*  And so it's like really, really big over there because that was like it was crazy. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2643.7999999999997s)]
*  There's so many people that I met that just had crazy high follower accounts. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2648.12s)]
*  And it's like you don't see that over here in America. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2651.72s)]
*  And then I looked into the data because I'm a data guy. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2654.44s)]
*  And I was like, oh, my gosh, like a fuckload of people use it over there. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2656.2799999999997s)]
*  And the usage skyrocketed after they banned TikTok and same thing with YouTube, [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2659.64s)]
*  actually, like India. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2663.32s)]
*  More people watch YouTube in India than in America because, again, like in America, [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2664.6s)]
*  we're competing. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2669.8s)]
*  It's TikTok over there. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2670.52s)]
*  They're not. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2671.32s)]
*  And then the fact that there's over a billion people. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2671.72s)]
*  So it's like YouTube is bigger over there, too. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2673.32s)]
*  Yeah, YouTube's bigger over there. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2675.64s)]
*  So it's like a huge market. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2677.0s)]
*  But I had a great time. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2678.28s)]
*  And it was just it was pretty intense, though. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2680.52s)]
*  Like I posted an Instagram story showing us driving down the road. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2682.84s)]
*  And they're just everywhere we drove. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2685.72s)]
*  There's just dozens of kids that would just run along the side of the road and follow our car. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2687.4s)]
*  It's exciting. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2691.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2692.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2692.6s)]
*  And so it was I felt I felt love. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2692.84s)]
*  Yeah, I felt very loved. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2695.48s)]
*  That's that's for sure. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2696.84s)]
*  I was like, damn, people over here, they care. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2697.8s)]
*  And it was it was cool. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2701.24s)]
*  It's cool. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2702.28s)]
*  It's a lot of good energy over there and it's safe energy, too. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2702.68s)]
*  So the excitement, I feel like in a place like India, you don't feel like it's going to get [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2705.56s)]
*  out of place. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2708.68s)]
*  Was it getting shady? [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2709.4s)]
*  You think not like that? [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2710.2s)]
*  I thought people would stab me, but they're how do I say it in a way where it doesn't sound [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2711.72s)]
*  like a being a diva? [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2715.4s)]
*  There were a little less concern for personal space over there. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2716.04s)]
*  There are there are like more they'll run up to you and get like really close people. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2721.32s)]
*  It's not a lot of personal space. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2725.8s)]
*  Yeah, they're like, get your own pillow. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2726.92s)]
*  Like in America, you know, people dab you up like a group of five or six people. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2728.92s)]
*  And they'll stay a foot or two away, you know. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2732.6s)]
*  But over there, like they'll just run up and hug me and like get really, really close. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2734.92s)]
*  And it gets a little intense sometimes. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2738.6800000000003s)]
*  Like I noticed like some of them did not give a fuck about my personal space, especially [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2740.04s)]
*  if it was a bigger group. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2744.6800000000003s)]
*  Oh, the one in your mouth if you leave it open. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2745.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2747.48s)]
*  So that was that was an interesting thing. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2748.2000000000003s)]
*  They just yeah, I remember being they would people were sleeping on the side of the road [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2749.96s)]
*  there. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2753.88s)]
*  I remember in India when I was there, you would just be driving it. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2754.12s)]
*  And I know people just, you know, somebody was just walking and I guess they decided [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2756.44s)]
*  to get some rest or whatever. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2759.48s)]
*  But yeah, you don't even get your own pillow in India. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2761.88s)]
*  Like you lay down and then there's other people have a little quiet. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2763.8s)]
*  It's just there's a lot of people there. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2766.84s)]
*  There is a lot of folks. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2768.28s)]
*  You were talking about feastables, dude. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2770.52s)]
*  And thank you guys sent me some, you know, I'll go the whole day. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2771.8s)]
*  I don't need any sugar. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2774.52s)]
*  Middle of the night crack open to a box of feastables that some asshole sent me. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2775.48s)]
*  And I'm that asshole. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2779.7200000000003s)]
*  And they're awesome. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2782.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2782.76s)]
*  And the peanut butter one is probably my favorite one. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2783.2400000000002s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2785.4s)]
*  But then it's like I just have so much, you know, I freak out in the middle of the night [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2786.1200000000003s)]
*  and because I'm just a damn sugar pervert. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2790.04s)]
*  And then now I just can't go back to bed, you know, but thank you. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2792.92s)]
*  And but what I want to say is would you ever do like a Willy Wonka type of thing? [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2796.76s)]
*  Because I feel like this, I mean, you already are kind of there, you know. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2801.08s)]
*  So, you know, we put 10 golden tickets in it one time. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2804.52s)]
*  I didn't know that. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2807.96s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's all good. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2808.6800000000003s)]
*  So we it's funny you asked. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2809.64s)]
*  So yeah, that's a great idea. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2811.56s)]
*  It's almost like we should put 10 golden tickets in random bars. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2813.7200000000003s)]
*  I should build a chocolate factory, fly them down, have them compete for it. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2816.6s)]
*  Did you already do all that? [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2820.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2821.96s)]
*  But it's it was pretty cool. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2823.0s)]
*  It was years ago. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2824.52s)]
*  Most of your fans probably have no idea I did it. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2825.08s)]
*  So yeah, we put the golden tickets out. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2827.32s)]
*  I built an actual chocolate river. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2830.36s)]
*  And you know, it's funny this I don't even know if I've ever told this story, but we I like [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2832.6s)]
*  it's the day before we're going to film, you know, the 10 golden ticket winners are in town [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2836.92s)]
*  and I go to the chocolate factory to just, you know, check out things. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2841.56s)]
*  And the chocolate river is just not there. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2845.4s)]
*  Like we had like literally had like a multiple feet deep spread across this like warehouse, [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2848.6s)]
*  like chocolate river. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2854.2799999999997s)]
*  But it's like there. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2855.48s)]
*  But then I come back the next day and it's just not there. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2857.72s)]
*  Like it's literally empty. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2859.8s)]
*  And what did happen? [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2860.84s)]
*  You think we don't know. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2861.72s)]
*  I mean, I guess there was like a hole in the lining on the bottom of the river we built. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2863.56s)]
*  And it just all sank through. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2868.2s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2870.84s)]
*  But see that chocolate we were right there. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2871.4s)]
*  My God, I did not know this at all. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2873.24s)]
*  Yeah, positive right there. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2875.48s)]
*  And you got the guy that took it? [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2877.08s)]
*  No, that's no one of our friends. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2879.0s)]
*  And then that's a he every time someone got eliminated, they got in the boat. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2880.36s)]
*  We paddled them down the chocolate river out the factory. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2883.3199999999997s)]
*  But yeah, so it's like the day before and I just walk in and there's like a waterfall [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2886.04s)]
*  and everything, but it's just empty. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2890.92s)]
*  And I'm like, where the fuck did my chocolate river go last night? [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2892.44s)]
*  And so we had to like blitz to refill it and redo the entire thing. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2897.08s)]
*  It was a fucking shit show. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2901.0s)]
*  Just search out Mr. B's chocolate factory and you can see like he could see what it [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2902.36s)]
*  actually looks like on YouTube. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2906.2s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2909.0s)]
*  I'm so behind on that. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2909.3999999999996s)]
*  No, it's all good. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2910.3599999999997s)]
*  I have so many crazy stories I can tell you about the fucking crazy shit we've done. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2911.3199999999997s)]
*  Like who else has built a fucking chocolate factory? [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2915.7999999999997s)]
*  You didn't even know. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2918.52s)]
*  Let's get here. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2919.3999999999996s)]
*  Skip ahead to the inside. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2919.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2921.56s)]
*  Or yeah, right there. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2921.7999999999997s)]
*  Look at that shit and candy and everything. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2923.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2925.72s)]
*  Buzz. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2925.8799999999997s)]
*  Wow. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2926.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2927.0s)]
*  So those are real, real candy. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2927.48s)]
*  I mean, it was fucking difficult to keep the bugs out of there. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2929.56s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2934.68s)]
*  You don't think about that bugs like candy. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2935.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2937.08s)]
*  And so we gave the winner the option of keep the factory or just have $500,000. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2937.24s)]
*  And I was like, yo, like this shot of factor chocolate river is probably going to disappear. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2941.64s)]
*  Tends to do that. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2945.72s)]
*  These candies are all going to go bad in the next few days. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2947.08s)]
*  Is this going to be an absolute disaster? [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2949.56s)]
*  Take the money. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2952.44s)]
*  I'd recommend you take the money. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2953.08s)]
*  I'll give it to you. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2954.2s)]
*  I mean, I'm not, you know, I will, but I just it's going to cost you like six figures. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2955.24s)]
*  They're like, clean this shit up. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2960.6s)]
*  Like, I don't want to just dump that on you. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2961.8799999999997s)]
*  You know, Bobby Flay in that too. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2963.56s)]
*  At the end is Gordon Ramsay. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2966.52s)]
*  So the last challenge they did is they had to cook a dessert and then whoever [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2967.72s)]
*  Gordon Ramsay said did the best one, the chocolate factory. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2972.2s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2974.92s)]
*  And he looks a little bit like Charlie from the original chocolate factory. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2975.7999999999997s)]
*  Pull up a Charlie from the original chocolate factory photo there. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2978.7599999999998s)]
*  Let's do a little side by side. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2981.32s)]
*  Gordon Ramsay too. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2982.68s)]
*  And I'm going to be so accurate here, which blew my own mind, actually. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2984.36s)]
*  Yeah, actually, actually, Carl, the guy to the right of kind of looks like. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2988.44s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2991.96s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2992.2799999999997s)]
*  No, the picture I want is up one. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2993.24s)]
*  But no, that scroll. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2996.04s)]
*  Yeah, no, right there to the left, left on that side right there. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=2997.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, Carl kind of looks like that. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3002.6s)]
*  We're pretty close, huh? [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3004.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3005.4s)]
*  Your imagination. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3005.7999999999997s)]
*  Pretty close right there. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3007.96s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3009.56s)]
*  That could be. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3010.04s)]
*  What is that shirtless photo of Gordon? [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3010.52s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3012.04s)]
*  No, go to that shirtless one. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3012.52s)]
*  What am I looking at? [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3013.7999999999997s)]
*  When did he start posing like that? [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3016.36s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3018.2799999999997s)]
*  My boy. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3019.08s)]
*  That's one vote for Bobby Kennedy. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3019.88s)]
*  Dude, that's crazy, bro. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3022.6s)]
*  Oh, Bobby Flay, Bobby Flay's daughter is beautiful, actually. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3025.64s)]
*  And I don't care if she hears it. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3028.8399999999997s)]
*  She's super talented. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3032.6s)]
*  That's exactly what I mean. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3033.7999999999997s)]
*  She's also a stunning young lady. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3035.0s)]
*  But what are we saying? [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3038.2s)]
*  I got more to say. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3041.0s)]
*  I'll tell you this. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3042.12s)]
*  Yes, you already did that, man. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3045.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3046.44s)]
*  And what's also interesting is while we were filming that video, [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3046.68s)]
*  I was doing a different video where I didn't eat any food for two weeks. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3049.48s)]
*  What's the longest fast you've ever done? [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3052.36s)]
*  I just did three days the other day of only water. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3053.96s)]
*  Or I did 72 hours. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3057.88s)]
*  It was good. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3058.92s)]
*  Got a little temperamental. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3059.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3061.0s)]
*  But I kind of enjoyed it. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3061.2400000000002s)]
*  And how long do you do? [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3062.36s)]
*  I did 14 days, only water. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3063.4s)]
*  Only water. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3064.92s)]
*  Yeah, I lost, what was it, like 20 something pounds. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3065.48s)]
*  Was it to lose weight or just to? [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3068.44s)]
*  You know, it was for a video just to see what happens. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3069.96s)]
*  And after like day five or six, you're pretty fucking drained. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3072.44s)]
*  You have no energy. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3078.6800000000003s)]
*  You know what's interesting? [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3079.56s)]
*  If you read online about extended fast, people will be like, [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3080.52s)]
*  you'll lose minimal muscle mass and it's mostly fat, [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3083.0s)]
*  which seemed like a lot of Reddit threads and things when you first Google it. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3086.6s)]
*  That's what it tells you. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3089.64s)]
*  So I did a DEXA scan before I did my extended fast, [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3090.52s)]
*  where they measure the fat muscle in your body and do one after. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3093.24s)]
*  And I lost like six pounds of muscle. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3096.04s)]
*  It was like pretty depressing how much muscle I lost. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3099.56s)]
*  Yeah, you lose it. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3102.44s)]
*  Yeah, which I mean is obvious, but that's not what the internet said what happened. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3103.32s)]
*  Which I was like, someone needs to correct this because, [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3107.16s)]
*  yeah, it was pretty depressing. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3110.04s)]
*  So I lost whatever it was, like 13 pounds of fat, seven pounds of lean mass. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3112.12s)]
*  But it's depressing because in your show you start to and you don't want to explain to people, [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3116.36s)]
*  hey, I'm fasting because people think something's going on with you. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3119.96s)]
*  Yeah, but even after you start eating, like the muscle didn't just come back. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3122.04s)]
*  So it's like, yeah, that was that was pretty brutal. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3125.4s)]
*  But it was it was intense not eating. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3127.64s)]
*  And I still was filming and working throughout it. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3130.84s)]
*  So like on day 10 and 11 and 12, like it was really fucking with me. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3132.68s)]
*  I'm standing up was just like brutal, you know, and like walking around or anything like that, [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3136.6s)]
*  because you have no energy. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3141.7200000000003s)]
*  You needed a real cane like Willy Wonka. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3142.68s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, that was that was intense. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3144.52s)]
*  And what were you did you notice like, but your clarity got pretty sharp as a whip. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3146.76s)]
*  Were you able to use that? [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3151.0s)]
*  People say that, but no, for me, it never that never hit. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3151.8s)]
*  I never got that like a superhuman clarity, because that's what I was hoping for. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3154.52s)]
*  Yeah, no, I just like I was just fucking tired, man, all the time. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3158.52s)]
*  I was too tired to have clarity. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3162.12s)]
*  Oh, I could read people's name. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3164.2000000000003s)]
*  I thought that guy was naked at first on the right. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3166.04s)]
*  Former All-Pro NFL tackle Russell Okung is also over 150 pounds since retiring, [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3168.52s)]
*  including losing 100 pounds in 40 days by fasting every day. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3173.4s)]
*  Yeah, that's just that's crazy. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3177.96s)]
*  We just started a video where we are about to start it after when I go back home. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3179.88s)]
*  We built a gym like just a weightlifting gym and then we put a big red circle around it. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3184.6s)]
*  And we're going to give a guy either. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3190.68s)]
*  I don't know which one if he loses 100 pounds before he leaves that red circle. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3193.08s)]
*  And so and he has a trainer in there and he has a chef and everything he'll need. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3199.24s)]
*  And then, yeah, and then exciting. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3202.52s)]
*  Yeah, so like that video might take like a year. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3205.3199999999997s)]
*  You know, so he just he's living in there. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3208.12s)]
*  We have cameras set up and it's just like lose 100 pounds or leave, you know, [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3209.7999999999997s)]
*  and if you lose 100 pounds before you leave, you win the money. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3214.6s)]
*  That's fair, dude. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3217.24s)]
*  They should do that around like an Indy car race, you know, [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3218.2s)]
*  just put a big, huge circle around like a talladega or whatever. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3222.36s)]
*  And just be like, lose 100 pounds. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3227.48s)]
*  Oh, I didn't think about the end of it. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3231.7200000000003s)]
*  Another video we're about to start, too, is I bought a jet and then we're grabbing two people [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3234.04s)]
*  who just got like graduated from pilot school or whatever, just got their license. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3238.04s)]
*  And we're going if you guys live in this ship for the next 100 days, don't step foot out of it once. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3242.04s)]
*  The next 100 days, you get to keep the jet. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3246.52s)]
*  So then they'll own a private jet, but they can fly it around or do whatever. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3248.52s)]
*  Just as long as they don't leave, they can't leave. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3251.4s)]
*  Yeah. So like I'm hoping they'll like fly to New York and just Uber [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3253.32s)]
*  eat some pizza to the door of the jet, then fly to California or whatever. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3256.28s)]
*  And it just like, yeah, that'll be a fun one. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3259.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, that sounds interesting. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3262.28s)]
*  Is there a video, say if you got to they shut you down, they're like, beast, you're done. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3263.56s)]
*  No beast around here, boy. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3267.4s)]
*  What if people were like that? [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3271.88s)]
*  And then you had to meet you got to make one more video. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3273.48s)]
*  Do you know what it would be? [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3275.96s)]
*  That's only one more. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3278.76s)]
*  Because you're already I mean, you've got the five million dollars. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3280.7599999999998s)]
*  You've upped the ante. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3283.16s)]
*  Yeah. Well, that's on the show. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3284.3599999999997s)]
*  But on YouTube, because I don't have streaming money on YouTube. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3285.7999999999997s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3289.24s)]
*  I don't know, man. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3291.3199999999997s)]
*  We've there's not because there's so many things I want to do. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3291.96s)]
*  It'd be hard to pick one. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3294.9199999999996s)]
*  Oh, there are. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3295.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. You still have a ton of ideas. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3296.3599999999997s)]
*  Oh, unlimited. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3298.2s)]
*  I mean, the bottleneck for me is not ideas. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3299.16s)]
*  It's just like actually pulling them off, you know, because a lot of these are multi-million [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3301.0s)]
*  dollar projects that take months upon months to set up, months to film, months to edit, etc. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3303.96s)]
*  So it's just like they're pretty brutal. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3307.7999999999997s)]
*  One of the ones we did recently that I thought was really cool. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3310.28s)]
*  But this is an example of how much time it takes is we built a bunker underground. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3313.2400000000002s)]
*  Did you see that one? [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3319.1600000000003s)]
*  I know. I'm not sure. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3319.96s)]
*  Okay. So we had to dig like a super deep hole. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3320.92s)]
*  We bought a bunker, put it in, covered it up, and then pull up the outside of it for him. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3324.36s)]
*  So you can see what it looks like. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3328.76s)]
*  And then we had to yeah, that top one right there. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3329.8s)]
*  I've seen some of this. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3332.04s)]
*  Yeah. So that's a bunker we built. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3333.0800000000004s)]
*  And then those two people, if they lived in there for 100 days, they won half a million dollars. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3335.0800000000004s)]
*  Oh, they did it too. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3339.16s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3340.12s)]
*  And then like, but you have to set deck the bunker and then so that's like multiple months [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3340.68s)]
*  of building and everything. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3345.3199999999997s)]
*  And then you put them in there and then that's still three months and 10 days of filming. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3346.6s)]
*  And then, you know, you have to have like camera crew there going around the clock and [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3350.6s)]
*  you have to have a medic there just for safety and all these other things. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3354.2s)]
*  And I have to check in every day. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3357.16s)]
*  And then now you come out the other end, you have a hundred days worth of footage, [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3358.3599999999997s)]
*  which takes, you know, editing team forever to come through and watch and edit and then [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3361.0s)]
*  build stories. So like that's like a eight month long project. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3364.52s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3367.8799999999997s)]
*  So that's they're just like, it's a lot. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3368.44s)]
*  Yeah, it's very, very intense. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3371.08s)]
*  And and that's the thing is like the fact that I can do all this for a YouTube video. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3372.76s)]
*  It was like unfathomable when I was growing up. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3378.84s)]
*  Like, it's crazy to see like the kind of content that can be supported by YouTube. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3381.32s)]
*  You know, like I think on that video, we probably spent like four and a half million [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3386.12s)]
*  dollars making that. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3388.92s)]
*  Yeah. Just on that between the bunker and the prize pool and everything. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3390.68s)]
*  And how many shows can you have? [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3393.48s)]
*  Like, can you have a couple of things going like that at once? [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3395.64s)]
*  Yeah, we have to. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3397.8s)]
*  I try to upload two videos a month, so we have to be working on six day videos at a [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3398.84s)]
*  time because these videos take months to pull off. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3403.32s)]
*  So if we're only working on one at a time, then I'd only upload once every like three [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3405.96s)]
*  or four months. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3410.1200000000003s)]
*  And do you come up with most of the ideas yourself or do you have kind of a team when [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3411.0800000000004s)]
*  you guys kind of pull them? [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3413.96s)]
*  Yeah. So that's where it's interesting because the ideas are incredibly important [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3414.92s)]
*  because like you I do a lot of seven day challenges, right? [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3419.8s)]
*  I spent seven days, very alive. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3423.4s)]
*  I spent seven days in solitary confinement, seven days in cave, underground city, [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3424.52s)]
*  seven days on the island, blah, blah, blah. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3427.72s)]
*  And what's interesting is like you could do seven days buried alive. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3429.16s)]
*  So me laying in a coffin for seven days or you could do theoretically, right? [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3432.52s)]
*  I could lay in a bathtub for seven days, right? [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3436.52s)]
*  Both take the same amount of my time. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3439.48s)]
*  Both are me just laying there. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3441.24s)]
*  But the one in the bathtub isn't going to get any views. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3442.9199999999996s)]
*  No one gives a fuck. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3444.7599999999998s)]
*  The one of me laying in a tomb underground, everyone will care because it's like fucking [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3445.3999999999996s)]
*  what the fuck this dude buried himself alive. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3449.3999999999996s)]
*  So it like shows like the theoretically it's kind of the same thing. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3451.16s)]
*  But this idea is just in a different setting environment and will probably get 10,000 times [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3456.28s)]
*  more views. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3460.52s)]
*  And so it shows like the importance of the idea, if that makes sense. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3461.1600000000003s)]
*  Like it's not views or success isn't just isn't directly correlated with the effort [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3464.0400000000004s)]
*  you put in. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3469.5600000000004s)]
*  A lot of it has to do with what is the overarching concept. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3470.1200000000003s)]
*  So once you kind of realize that you just like you're really obsessed with how do I [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3473.0s)]
*  come up with crazy, cool, original viral ideas. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3477.4s)]
*  And so that's what I spent most of my teenage years obsessing over. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3480.36s)]
*  And I used to do every single day, I would brainstorm video ideas and I'd write them [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3483.96s)]
*  write them down. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3488.04s)]
*  And that's how I built like I just like Google Sheet with like 10,000 ideas on it. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3488.68s)]
*  It's ridiculous. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3492.6s)]
*  I thought of trying to sell that to YouTubers at one point because there's so many there. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3493.32s)]
*  I could never film them. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3496.28s)]
*  But then after a while, now that things have gotten so big and I have to like film 25, [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3497.32s)]
*  28 days a month and I have all this stuff going on, I can't do an hour a day. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3501.96s)]
*  So I hired people to do it for me. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3505.16s)]
*  And then, you know, like once a week, they'll just go, hey, here's 200 really cool, unique [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3507.0s)]
*  ideas. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3511.08s)]
*  I'll flip through them and they'll usually inspire something ahead. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3511.64s)]
*  Because a big thing, too, is like this is what I've probably said this on podcasts before. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3514.36s)]
*  But like if there was like a fruit in Africa that if you ate, you grew two feet taller [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3519.08s)]
*  and you didn't know that exist until I just told you right now. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3524.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3527.48s)]
*  You wouldn't have been able to brainstorm ideas around eating that fruit. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3527.72s)]
*  But now that you know it exists, you could. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3530.68s)]
*  And so it's like very important to always be intaking new information and learning things [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3532.68s)]
*  because that's how you come up with more original, creative stuff. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3538.68s)]
*  Like I noticed when I first started hiring people to like, you know, start brainstorming [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3542.68s)]
*  stuff for me that like after two months of someone doing this, you would just basically [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3546.7599999999998s)]
*  start getting the same ideas on autopilot. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3551.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3553.3999999999996s)]
*  Like if a guy really likes basketball, you'll start to notice like, oh, 10 percent of his [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3553.56s)]
*  ideas have to do a basketball. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3557.72s)]
*  But it's not because basketball is like the greatest ideas, the most viral thing is just [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3559.3199999999997s)]
*  because that's what he watches. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3563.0s)]
*  And so, you know, and you'll notice if someone watches baseball, though, oh, now they can [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3563.96s)]
*  conveniently have baseball ideas. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3568.12s)]
*  And so what you want is you just want to get someone who you just almost like want to make [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3569.3199999999997s)]
*  them constantly learn and absorb new information. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3574.8399999999997s)]
*  Listen to 10 different podcasts, one episode of each, not 10 of one. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3577.3199999999997s)]
*  Listen, you know, watch every sport, not one. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3581.24s)]
*  And you you almost have to like to train people to help you come up with good ideas. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3583.4s)]
*  You have to just train them to watch a bunch of different content and absorb information [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3586.8399999999997s)]
*  and you'll see it come out in their ideas. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3591.08s)]
*  If that makes sense. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3592.52s)]
*  So first of all, you'd find somebody who you like, OK, I like this, that this person comes [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3593.24s)]
*  up with ideas and then you'd be like, now I just need to I need them to encourage them [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3596.52s)]
*  to consume different things. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3600.6s)]
*  It's almost like a different ingredient, different ingredients to come out with a different [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3601.8s)]
*  cake. Exactly. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3605.0s)]
*  Yeah. So you control their information diet by information diet. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3606.04s)]
*  That's wild. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3609.96s)]
*  Yeah. And that's yeah. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3610.7599999999998s)]
*  I mean, I obsess over things. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3612.28s)]
*  So yeah, it's important. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3614.36s)]
*  But that's that's that's been super helpful because yeah, it's just that's how we because [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3615.4s)]
*  a big part of getting 100 million views theoretically on a video is if [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3621.16s)]
*  any, you know, is it something someone has seen before or not? [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3626.04s)]
*  Like there's this Ted talk I watched one time and he was talking about how, you know, [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3629.56s)]
*  if you're driving down the road, you just see a cow, you're probably not even going to look at it. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3633.48s)]
*  Right. Who cares? [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3637.7999999999997s)]
*  You've seen him all the time. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3638.7599999999998s)]
*  But if you're driving down the road and there's a purple cow, you're going to look like four [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3639.72s)]
*  times. You're going to remember that. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3643.7999999999997s)]
*  Like you know, someone could ask you a year later and you'll be like, yeah, I saw a purple cow. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3645.08s)]
*  And it's like the only difference is it's purple. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3648.2s)]
*  And it's kind of the same way on social media. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3650.36s)]
*  Right. Like if you're scrolling through videos and it's [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3652.44s)]
*  something you've seen before, nothing too crazy, it's just the it's almost like you should [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3654.76s)]
*  visualize it's like that's the equivalent of someone seeing a cow. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3659.1600000000003s)]
*  But if it's something they've never seen before, like you putting a bunker underground and two [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3661.5600000000004s)]
*  people living in it, that's that is the equivalent of a purple cow on social media. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3665.32s)]
*  Like how do I make something that Prince would drink milk out of, you know? [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3669.0s)]
*  Wait, what did you just say? [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3672.5200000000004s)]
*  Like how do you make something that Prince would drink milk out of Prince? [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3673.7200000000003s)]
*  Prince musician, what's his last name? [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3678.0400000000004s)]

*  No. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3684.52s)]
*  Oh, Prince. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3685.1600000000003s)]
*  I've heard the word Little Rick. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3686.04s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3688.6s)]

*  Got you. So like, how do you make this right? [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3693.2400000000002s)]
*  Two thousand princes, right? [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3696.2000000000003s)]
*  But he's the he's he's the one on one. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3699.48s)]
*  Yeah, he's Prince. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3701.88s)]
*  Gotcha. Right. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3703.0s)]
*  Like that's what I'm saying. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3704.6800000000003s)]
*  Like, how do you I got you? [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3705.48s)]

*  helped talk about it with someone. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3911.08s)]

*  Do you feel like? [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3954.68s)]
*  Well, that's a good one. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3955.72s)]
*  I would say the biggest one is I think people think we make content for kids and like, you know, but. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3959.3199999999997s)]
*  Oh, that's a great one. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3966.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3967.4s)]
*  Great answer. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3967.64s)]
*  And it's a lot of because I've been famous, famous air quotes, I don't know, but for a while now. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3968.6s)]
*  And the thing is, when I was like in my young, like 20 years, I'm 26 now, when I was like 20 or 21, [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3976.04s)]
*  I didn't have much experience with storytelling or like making these like videos with contestants [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3982.04s)]
*  and like how to like show what they were feeling or anything. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3987.2400000000002s)]
*  So back then, the videos came across a little like ADHD, like fast paced or whatever, because [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3990.04s)]
*  I saw like I had Christopher Nolan as a father teaching me. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3995.6400000000003s)]
*  I was just learning storytelling as I was going. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3997.96s)]
*  So a lot of my videos back then got a lot of views and like same when I was like 22 or 23. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=3999.96s)]
*  But, you know, the last three years, we've really leveled up the storytelling and building [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4005.08s)]
*  characters and especially the last 18 months and gotten better at like making content that, [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4008.68s)]
*  you know, people in their 20s and 30s would be like, well, this is like good and could enjoy. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4013.4s)]
*  But because a lot of people haven't seen my newer videos and watched my older ones, [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4017.88s)]
*  they still think all my videos are like that. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4022.2s)]
*  So they just kind of like push it off. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4023.8s)]
*  So like when someone says like, your videos are too ADHD, you don't have any storytelling. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4025.24s)]
*  I'll usually like show them like one or two of our newer videos. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4031.3199999999997s)]
*  I was like, oh my God, this is great. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4033.72s)]
*  And I was like, yeah, let me guess. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4035.0s)]
*  You just haven't seen a video in two years. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4036.3599999999997s)]
*  I was like, yeah. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4037.4799999999996s)]
*  And so that kind of is a little bit of a misconception. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4038.2s)]
*  I'm constantly fighting. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4041.4799999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4043.0s)]
*  Is that you're still like this kind of just entertainment for kids or that your [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4043.24s)]
*  entertainment, your ability to entertain is also still junior? [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4046.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4051.16s)]
*  And so which obviously younger people watch the video. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4051.9599999999996s)]
*  I think like anyone could watch that bunker video and be like, [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4055.96s)]
*  well, this is just high quality entertaining stuff. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4059.32s)]
*  It's not like you have to be. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4061.32s)]
*  Oh, I love that. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4062.2s)]
*  The child inside of me liked it and the adult inside of me liked it. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4063.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4065.88s)]
*  So that would be one. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4066.84s)]
*  I guess other misconceptions of it is like, we, I mean, it looks like a lot of these videos, [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4068.92s)]
*  just, you know, it just looks like me and the boys having fun because that's what I [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4075.72s)]
*  want it to look like. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4079.88s)]
*  I want to put the boys in an environment where they're just themselves and things like that. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4080.44s)]
*  I think people think what I do is a lot easier than it is. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4083.72s)]
*  Like, like these things are monster monumental projects that are a pitch to fucking do. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4086.8399999999997s)]
*  And it's like, you know, and you know, a hundred plus million people are going to watch it. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4093.16s)]
*  And you know, like, so everything's just got to be fucking great and perfect. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4096.84s)]
*  And but we don't have years to do these things. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4099.719999999999s)]
*  We're trying to do what most people would do in a year and two months. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4101.96s)]
*  So it's like, you know, it is tight timelines and it's, it's just, we don't have the budgets [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4104.5199999999995s)]
*  of these giant studios or anything when we're doing these YouTube videos. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4109.48s)]
*  And it's just, it's, it's very, very difficult. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4112.12s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4114.28s)]
*  Like I have hundreds of employees full time. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4114.76s)]
*  You do. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4116.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4117.4s)]
*  That depend on that YouTube channel. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4117.72s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4119.48s)]
*  At Mr. Beast Productions? [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4119.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4122.04s)]
*  I don't even know if I guess Mr. Beast Studios. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4122.6s)]
*  But yeah, it's, it's just a lot of pressure because it's, yeah, it's just a lot of people [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4124.92s)]
*  depend on it. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4129.8s)]
*  These and it's, it's just absurd to think that I have all these employees and we're [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4130.44s)]
*  spending all this money. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4133.96s)]
*  And I just assume like the magical YouTube algorithm when I post this video is just going [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4135.08s)]
*  to give it to a hundred million people every single time. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4139.64s)]
*  And it's like, it's just like, that's a lot of stress and it's like, it's a lot of people [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4142.12s)]
*  who, you know, watch the con. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4146.280000000001s)]
*  It's just a lot of everything. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4147.64s)]
*  It's a lot of pressure, a lot of stress. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4148.92s)]
*  And it's like, if I don't film, then there's no video. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4150.4400000000005s)]
*  So it's also not a typical business because, you know, you can, any other company, you [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4153.72s)]
*  can replace basically anyone. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4158.12s)]
*  But you are the business. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4159.56s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4160.6s)]
*  I am like literally if I'm just like, yo, for the next month, I don't want to film [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4161.0s)]
*  the business debt. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4165.64s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4166.360000000001s)]
*  So it's like, it's yeah, it's I, I wouldn't, I, yeah, I just, it's a lot. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4167.08s)]
*  It's just a lot. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4174.84s)]
*  It seems like a lot, but do you, did you know it was going to be that much stress? [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4175.48s)]
*  Do you find that you like the stress? [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4179.08s)]
*  Like I remember even just for myself, right? [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4180.68s)]
*  Like we have responsibilities now we do like six episodes a month now. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4183.08s)]
*  And at first I remember I could barely do one episode a week was tough and some weeks [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4187.0s)]
*  it still is, but then some days I'll go through and it's like, this just starts to feel easier. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4191.5599999999995s)]
*  I start to kind of acclimate to where I am. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4195.88s)]
*  And then there's a part of my brain that's like, okay, well now what can we do? [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4198.12s)]
*  But that same part of my brain is just the brain that, that forgets like fucking, we [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4201.56s)]
*  barely just got to this place and are we even okay here? [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4205.400000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4209.32s)]
*  So it's tough for me to like monitor the different parts of my brain, the one that [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4209.88s)]
*  wants to do more or try new things. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4212.92s)]
*  And the one that also wants to make sure we're okay, we're at and not happy. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4215.88s)]
*  Right. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4220.68s)]
*  And be happy. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4221.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4221.72s)]
*  It's like, yeah. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4222.2s)]
*  So most of the time I work now it's like, I guess what my question is like, fuck, I [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4223.56s)]
*  don't know what it is, man. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4228.92s)]
*  Do you know what it is? [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4229.72s)]
*  I get what you're trying to ask. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4230.76s)]
*  It's like, how do you, which side of the pendulum are you swinging between being [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4231.8s)]
*  stressed and wanting to die constantly or like prioritizing being happy and like that [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4236.200000000001s)]
*  basically. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4240.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4240.68s)]
*  And are you able to battle that? [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4240.84s)]
*  Do you know, did you know you were as competitive in and, or do you think you're competing [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4242.04s)]
*  against like the algorithm or you want people to see it? [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4246.280000000001s)]
*  Like, you know, what is that thing that are you able to notice? [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4249.320000000001s)]
*  Like, because I don't even know sometimes what drives me to do things or want to learn [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4251.88s)]
*  more. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4255.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4256.36s)]
*  I would say I like you, I'm just incredibly, incredibly, incredibly competitive. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4256.52s)]
*  I just love winning. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4262.6s)]
*  And it's the thing is I think people have a misconception. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4263.64s)]
*  They like try to put everyone, especially famous people in a box where it's like, this [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4266.4400000000005s)]
*  is what motivates them. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4269.88s)]
*  And this one reason is why they do everything. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4270.68s)]
*  And I believe you can be motivated by multiple things. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4272.68s)]
*  Right. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4276.28s)]
*  Like one thing that pushes me is the fact that, you know, a lot of my friends I grew [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4276.52s)]
*  up with work for me. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4280.68s)]
*  And I don't want to ever have to fire them because we can't afford to pay them. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4281.719999999999s)]
*  I have people who, you know, moved across the world to come work for me. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4284.44s)]
*  So, you know, that's one thing that motivates me being able to provide for the people who [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4288.04s)]
*  risked everything. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4291.639999999999s)]
*  Another thing that motivates me is I just love entertaining people. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4292.599999999999s)]
*  And the fact that I get to entertain a hundred million people or 200 million people or [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4295.08s)]
*  whatever it is, like I think our average videos are doing 200 million views the first year. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4298.839999999999s)]
*  Like, I know that's a thing that won't last forever. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4302.12s)]
*  Right. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4305.32s)]
*  I mean, that's like, at some point, you know, I'm not going to be able to upload something [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4305.5599999999995s)]
*  and three percent of the humans alive are going to watch it. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4309.88s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4312.360000000001s)]
*  So part of it is I want to make sure I'm like taking advantage of the opportunity I have [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4312.84s)]
*  here. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4317.0s)]
*  This is like I and when I'm 40, I can't expect that. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4317.24s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4320.28s)]
*  Like, and so that's one. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4321.0s)]
*  And another one is like, it just for whatever reason, it just is like built in my blood. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4323.0s)]
*  Like, this is just what I do. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4328.2s)]
*  Like working is just what I live for. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4329.88s)]
*  And like, I don't really know what else to do with my life. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4332.6s)]
*  Like, it just I'm just a machine that goes. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4335.64s)]
*  And if I'm not working on something like stimulating and pushing and innovating, I just kind of [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4337.48s)]
*  get depressed and like, I'm like, why am I alive? [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4342.2s)]
*  What am I doing? [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4344.919999999999s)]
*  You know, you get that from one of your folks, you think? [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4345.639999999999s)]
*  No, I've just kind of always been like this. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4348.599999999999s)]
*  My mom hates it because I don't really celebrate wins or anything. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4350.12s)]
*  I just always grinding on things. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4353.16s)]
*  And yeah, I don't know. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4355.719999999999s)]
*  I think just some people are hardwired like that. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4358.36s)]
*  And I think but I think you just got to be who you are. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4360.12s)]
*  Like that it just is who I am. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4364.759999999999s)]
*  But there's other people who see my lifestyle because I've talked about it on podcasts and a [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4366.44s)]
*  lot of creators want to be like me. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4370.44s)]
*  And they end up scaling up bigger teams and they end up trying to do videos like me. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4371.719999999999s)]
*  And then they find out they're miserable and they fucking hate it. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4375.719999999999s)]
*  And it's too much stress and pressure. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4378.759999999999s)]
*  And so I wouldn't advise this for most creators. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4380.04s)]
*  Right. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4383.08s)]
*  Like I don't have work life balance. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4383.32s)]
*  I just you don't work. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4385.639999999999s)]
*  I know. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4386.919999999999s)]
*  I just I mean, I'm like there are some months where I film 28 days and I still have to run [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4387.4s)]
*  feastables. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4393.5599999999995s)]
*  I still do film 28 days on the main channel. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4394.12s)]
*  And I film for our beast philanthropy channel. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4397.48s)]
*  I still film stuff for Tik Tok because we have over 100 million followers to Tik Tok. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4399.24s)]
*  And I have to do stuff on Instagram. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4402.04s)]
*  I still have the network and do these things. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4403.4s)]
*  And it's like I mean, it's basically if my eyes are open, I'm there to work. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4405.32s)]
*  It's like I have a person whose job is just to help me basically write everything I want [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4410.599999999999s)]
*  to accomplish on a whiteboard. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4415.5599999999995s)]
*  I mean, it will take up the size of this wall. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4416.919999999999s)]
*  And it's like all my priors and things I could be doing, things I should be doing, things [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4418.759999999999s)]
*  other people need me to be doing. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4421.72s)]
*  And then we'll just go in the next seven days, I'll circle all the things I want to do ancillary [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4423.4800000000005s)]
*  on top of what naturally I have to do. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4428.52s)]
*  And then he'll just like schedule out basically every second my eyes are open. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4430.4400000000005s)]
*  And which is good because it helps me. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4435.96s)]
*  I sometimes fall into a trap of being reactive. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4438.6s)]
*  Like my content channel needs me to film this. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4440.6s)]
*  This needs feastables, needs me to do this. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4443.64s)]
*  And but you're never going to achieve something great if you're just constantly like a ping [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4445.56s)]
*  pong ball being told what you need to do by your employees. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4450.04s)]
*  So occasionally you need to be proactive and do other things that other people wouldn't [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4452.52s)]
*  think of and be a little bit more visionary. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4456.52s)]
*  So doing that kind of helps make sure I'm prioritizing things correctly and things like [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4458.04s)]
*  that. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4462.04s)]
*  Well, it's interesting because in the beginning you're kind of working for yourself because [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4462.28s)]
*  you're the creator, but then you build an audience and then you start to work for the [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4466.2s)]
*  audience in a weird way, right? [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4469.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4471.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4471.8s)]
*  And there's no judgment against that, but I just noticed that in my own life in the [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4472.12s)]
*  beginning, like I'd give anything to have an audience, you know, but it's more like [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4475.0s)]
*  it felt like me being me. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4478.2s)]
*  But then it's also starts to feel like you now. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4479.72s)]
*  Now you have the audience. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4482.2s)]
*  Now you have somebody to work for. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4483.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4484.04s)]
*  You you. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4484.2s)]
*  Yeah, because you technically couldn't just one 80 and like, you know, because if you did, [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4485.72s)]
*  you'd lose your audience. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4489.96s)]
*  And so, yeah, I guess technically you're working working for them in a way. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4490.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4494.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4494.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4494.76s)]
*  Yeah, I was going to say, what did you learn about being a boss? [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4495.96s)]
*  Like because I never wanted to be like having any employees, right? [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4498.12s)]
*  I never even wanted to be an employee. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4501.4800000000005s)]
*  I didn't want to have any employees. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4504.12s)]
*  I wanted to have pizza. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4505.96s)]
*  You know, you know, sounds like the life. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4507.4s)]
*  Yeah, you know what I'm saying? [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4509.48s)]
*  I'm going to live in a park. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4510.5199999999995s)]
*  But what I'm saying is, um, oh, shit, hold on. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4512.28s)]
*  I know what it is. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4515.96s)]
*  I think that what did you learn about yourself? [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4517.08s)]
*  Like about being a boss? [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4519.639999999999s)]
*  Like I learned that if I don't show up in a comfortable way, then it's it affects my how [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4520.679999999999s)]
*  my employees are. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4526.2s)]
*  I've learned that I have to communicate better as to what I want because people don't just [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4527.719999999999s)]
*  know what I want. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4531.48s)]
*  Yeah, there's some things that I've learned. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4532.36s)]
*  Learn the hard way kind of whether things that you've learned just about being a boss. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4533.719999999999s)]
*  Oh, I mean, of course, because I went from one to I think now across everything, I employ [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4538.04s)]
*  over 400 people. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4543.24s)]
*  So full time. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4544.44s)]
*  So it's like, yeah, I mean, that when I first started hiring people, I was I was 19. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4545.5599999999995s)]
*  So like, or not maybe even 18. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4549.96s)]
*  So I was a teenager with no idea. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4551.879999999999s)]
*  I mean, yeah, you asked what I learned. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4554.04s)]
*  I mean, at the start, I literally went to this is how stupid I was when I was a teenager. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4555.879999999999s)]
*  I literally went to a comedy club or whatever comedy trick. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4560.04s)]
*  What was it? [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4564.759999999999s)]
*  Comedy? [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4565.16s)]
*  It was just open. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4565.88s)]
*  Open mic. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4567.08s)]
*  Yeah, Tariq was one of the people hired there. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4567.64s)]
*  It's funny. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4568.92s)]
*  He's still here seven days later, seven years later. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4569.24s)]
*  But I went to an open mic and I was just like, you know, I want my YouTube channel to be [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4571.08s)]
*  a little funnier. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4577.24s)]
*  So I'm just going to go hire some random comedians at an open mic. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4577.8s)]
*  So I just went to one and then I just was like writing on like a notepad every time [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4580.4400000000005s)]
*  they they made me laugh. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4584.28s)]
*  The comedians and then the ones that made me laugh the most. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4585.64s)]
*  They just afterwards went backstage and I was like, you know, you want a job, you want [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4587.72s)]
*  to help me make YouTube videos? [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4590.92s)]
*  And that's how I first started hiring. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4591.88s)]
*  And then after that, I went into like my local Best Buy, you know, like the electronic store. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4593.88s)]
*  This is fucking stupid, but I didn't know what I was doing. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4597.96s)]
*  Like, obviously, if you want to hire people, you should just go find production people, [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4601.64s)]
*  people with creative experience or whatever, not go into a local Best Buy. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4605.64s)]
*  And I hired like seven people, my local electronic store. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4608.84s)]
*  And so I have like this rag tag group of comedians and this rag tag group of people who sell [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4612.04s)]
*  fucking laptops. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4617.72s)]
*  And I'm like, yo, mixed in with some people I just hired from my high school. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4618.92s)]
*  And I'm like, and we're making these videos that are getting views and like I'm scaling [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4622.68s)]
*  up and I'm like, you know, I'm like, guys, let's give my three million subscriber three [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4626.6s)]
*  million pennies. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4629.8s)]
*  And they're like, how the fuck do we get three million pennies? [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4630.360000000001s)]
*  I'm like, I don't know. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4632.4400000000005s)]
*  And we're just like brute forcing shit. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4633.240000000001s)]
*  And I mean, it was an absolute dumpster fire. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4635.72s)]
*  I didn't know what I was doing because I wish I had a mentor or something. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4637.8s)]
*  But then after a while, I realized, oh, maybe I should hire people who have a little bit [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4642.280000000001s)]
*  of experience in this field, not laptop salesmen and comedians. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4646.280000000001s)]
*  And over time, we kind of started to figure it out. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4650.04s)]
*  And but you stayed in motion. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4653.56s)]
*  It sounds like to the like, oh, you kept you're like, this is how I do. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4655.4s)]
*  I need something funny. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4658.2s)]
*  I'll go to a place that has funny. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4658.92s)]
*  I need a guy who can sell refrigerators, but talk about also iPods, right? [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4660.12s)]
*  I'll go to a Best Buy, right? [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4665.88s)]
*  Yeah, the best one is the dumbest thing I've ever done. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4667.32s)]
*  My life. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4668.92s)]
*  I'm pretty crazy because some of those people just smoking weed and wearing a shirt. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4669.32s)]
*  They're not even clocked in. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4673.64s)]
*  Yeah, it was like wearing a blue shirt. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4675.32s)]
*  It was not that high. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4676.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4677.88s)]
*  Highest quality people. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4678.12s)]
*  Oh, one of them ended up being a convicted felon, too. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4680.2s)]
*  And I didn't even realize that when I hired them. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4682.679999999999s)]
*  But oh, yeah. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4684.2s)]
*  So it's just like, oh, you know, Best Buy hired them. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4685.24s)]
*  I'm sure they do. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4688.679999999999s)]
*  They're fine. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4690.04s)]
*  I was supposed to do background checks when I was a teenager. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4691.32s)]
*  Obviously, we do that now. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4694.36s)]
*  But yeah, I mean, everything I I didn't know how payroll worked or taxes. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4695.639999999999s)]
*  I didn't know. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4700.5199999999995s)]
*  I didn't know what a CFO was or bookkeeping. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4701.32s)]
*  So it's just like a lot. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4703.719999999999s)]
*  And I just had to learn it through trial and error. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4705.799999999999s)]
*  But this we have an audience the whole time. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4707.32s)]
*  So it's not like I can just pause things and then go, oh, let me just get rid of all these [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4708.92s)]
*  Best Buy and comedians and replace them for real people. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4712.92s)]
*  So I have to keep filming. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4714.6s)]
*  But these videos we're filming are videos no one's ever done before. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4716.12s)]
*  So these are really complicated things that are constantly going wrong. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4718.92s)]
*  I think back then, one in three videos I filmed just like I didn't like it. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4721.56s)]
*  So I scrapped it or it got fucked up when we were filming it or whatever. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4725.4s)]
*  Because these are just big spectacles and we just didn't have the team for it. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4728.84s)]
*  And I was reinvesting everything. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4733.88s)]
*  There was one time where I accidentally overspent and we were like negative $200,000. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4735.88s)]
*  That's a lot. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4742.36s)]
*  Yeah. My mom was like losing her fucking mind. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4743.96s)]
*  And I was like, it's fine, mom. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4746.759999999999s)]
*  I'll just next month, I think we'll make like 200 grand or whatever. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4748.04s)]
*  And I'll just spend a little less. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4752.12s)]
*  And I will dig out of this hole. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4753.5599999999995s)]
*  Like she hated it. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4755.24s)]
*  Because she was helping with the finances. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4757.24s)]
*  Yeah. Well, that. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4759.0s)]
*  But we just didn't have money growing up. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4759.88s)]
*  So like when I wanted to like when I think one month we made like $100,000 and she was like [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4761.96s)]
*  very adamant. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4769.88s)]
*  She's like, just put 20% away. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4770.4400000000005s)]
*  Just let me build a nest egg, this and that. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4772.280000000001s)]
*  And I was like, no, actually, I was thinking of just giving like $100,000 to Twitch streamers. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4773.88s)]
*  I think that'd be a good video people would like. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4778.360000000001s)]
*  And she's like, for 10 hours straight was like, why not give them $80,000? [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4779.96s)]
*  And this is where I'm a lot better at communicating now than I was back then. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4787.0s)]
*  I was like, I mean, you're talking like this is a guy who grew up with pimples and communicate [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4790.12s)]
*  much sat in his room and fucking worked on YouTube videos and obsessed over business [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4794.12s)]
*  and entrepreneurship where everyone else just want to watch South Park. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4798.5199999999995s)]
*  And so I didn't relate to anyone. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4801.08s)]
*  So my social skills were negative 10,000. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4802.599999999999s)]
*  So I was horrible at communicating things. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4805.96s)]
*  So I just be like, and like in hindsight, it's kind of obvious. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4808.2s)]
*  But at the time, like there's a huge language barrier between me and my mom. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4810.92s)]
*  Because all that existed in this brain was make the best videos possible. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4814.28s)]
*  And she didn't fully get that. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4817.96s)]
*  That was it. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4820.28s)]
*  I was a robot that that is what I live for. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4821.08s)]
*  I was not a human at that time. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4824.36s)]
*  And so I was just like, if we made 100 grand, why would I not spend the 100 grand on videos? [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4825.72s)]
*  And she'd be like, put some away. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4830.599999999999s)]
*  And I was like, but if I put it away, I would just spend it on other videos. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4832.2s)]
*  So why can't I just spend it on videos now? [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4836.36s)]
*  And we would just do that hours every single day. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4838.2s)]
*  You're like, if I put away 20 grand, you know that I'm only going to be able to make 80% [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4840.599999999999s)]
*  of the best video I could make at that time. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4843.96s)]
*  Why am I putting the money away? [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4847.64s)]
*  Right. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4848.84s)]
*  To not make a good video? [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4849.64s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4851.0s)]
*  I was like, mom, my rent is like $350. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4851.32s)]
*  The car is fine. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4855.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4856.6s)]
*  I was like, why do we need to put away? [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4857.0s)]
*  And she's just be like, and I also didn't fully realize this, but you know, she would even get [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4858.76s)]
*  trauma to like 2008 when they lost everything and went bankrupt. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4864.6s)]
*  And so she was like, we got to save something. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4867.48s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4869.48s)]
*  But yeah, so that's what would make it intense. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4870.6s)]
*  I didn't fully understand it at the time either. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4873.48s)]
*  So it would like get her to the point where she would cry because I would reinvest [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4875.32s)]
*  everything and she just like didn't want what happened to her in 2008 to happen to me. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4878.76s)]
*  And I just like didn't care at all. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4882.4400000000005s)]
*  I just like, wow, trust me videos. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4885.16s)]
*  And so that was a thing for a very long time, but eventually she got to the point where she's [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4887.88s)]
*  like, you know what? [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4893.08s)]
*  I'll just trust you. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4893.72s)]
*  And that's when things got great because then like it helped my relationship with her a lot [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4894.6s)]
*  because she started stressing less and she just believes, you know, I got it. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4899.0s)]
*  She's like, Jimmy, you'll figure this out. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4903.0s)]

*  Something? [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4916.360000000001s)]
*  Do you guys ever go to a concert together or something? [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4916.52s)]
*  What do you like to do? [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4918.4400000000005s)]
*  Anything together right now? [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4919.64s)]
*  I don't really get any time off. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4921.8s)]
*  So we joke like in 10 years, all the things we'll do when like things kind of cool off. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4924.280000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4929.400000000001s)]
*  But no, she gets it. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4929.88s)]
*  She she actually sent me a message. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4931.400000000001s)]
*  Like I think it was like four days ago, like a really long message saying how [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4933.96s)]
*  she was very grateful that she still gets to work with me and do things with me and how like [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4937.0s)]
*  most people in my position would like push their mom away. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4940.52s)]
*  But we we do a lot of our bonding is like doing work stuff and things like that because it's like [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4942.6s)]
*  then it's like something I truly care about. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4948.120000000001s)]
*  You know, like if we went to a concert, like she would see through that facade. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4950.120000000001s)]
*  She would know I'm not doing that because I care. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4953.96s)]
*  Just doing it to like check a box. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4956.040000000001s)]
*  So but when we work together, it's like genuinely fulfilling and it's cool to like. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4957.400000000001s)]
*  She likes to work too. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4961.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4962.040000000001s)]
*  Well, it the stuff she was doing when we're building the business. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4962.280000000001s)]
*  No, that was very stressful. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4965.8s)]
*  Now we have it to stuff that's a little more chill and where it's fun. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4966.84s)]
*  Like, you know, we have hundreds of employees that have divvy cards and all these things. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4969.88s)]
*  And so we have a lot of bank accounts. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4973.72s)]
*  You know, how do you know, you know, someone's not just stealing money. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4975.320000000001s)]
*  Who else can you trust besides your mom to control the master accounts? [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4978.92s)]
*  Because at some point, there is a master key of someone who could. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4981.8s)]
*  I mean, if they wanted to just withdraw a million dollars and just fucking run to Mexico. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4984.4400000000005s)]
*  Right. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4987.88s)]
*  You know, so like that's like a really big thing that I counted my mom just to like [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4988.12s)]
*  manage the accounts and make sure there's no fraud and stuff like that. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4992.360000000001s)]
*  I'm fucking know like and things like that. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4995.32s)]
*  But yeah, it's been a it's been a fun journey. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=4998.360000000001s)]
*  And so I'm very grateful for my mom. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5002.4400000000005s)]
*  It's kind of crazy that like moms just put 18 years of their life just pouring everything [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5004.6s)]
*  into building up real. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5009.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5010.6s)]
*  This human and it's a risk, dude. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5010.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5013.16s)]
*  Like this human and most humans look up most humans or whatever. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5013.400000000001s)]
*  But most humans, they're it's you know, it's a shaky business. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5017.88s)]
*  Just being a human. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5022.2s)]
*  I know. And then they just unleash you in the wild and then you just move on. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5023.08s)]
*  And it's like, it's just wild. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5026.5199999999995s)]
*  It's really a crazy premise, you know? [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5028.84s)]
*  Yeah, because I'm thinking about how like, you know, when I love to spoil my mom, [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5031.4s)]
*  because I'm like, you just like gave everything for 18 years, especially after 2008 and all [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5035.72s)]
*  this stuff, you know, worked multiple jobs just so I could like at the time, what you [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5041.64s)]
*  thought was just be a brat and work on YouTube videos. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5045.96s)]
*  And you thought, you know, just basically it almost would have seen my purpose in life [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5048.28s)]
*  was to make it as miserable as possible. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5052.2s)]
*  Yet you kept raising me and didn't give up on me. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5053.5599999999995s)]
*  And it's like, so I think of that and then I'm like, fuck, I need to spoil my mom. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5056.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5059.5599999999995s)]
*  Like, you know, like I think of a different parallel universe where I'm not in this position. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5059.8s)]
*  It's like, damn, I would never have been able to like repay her for all that. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5064.12s)]
*  Spoiler as much. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5067.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5068.92s)]
*  Or spoiler as much. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5069.32s)]
*  There's been recently like in the news and stuff, I'm not as a brat on it, but there [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5070.76s)]
*  was like they were trying it seemed like they were trying to like poke holes in you guys's [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5075.5599999999995s)]
*  company and stuff. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5080.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5081.72s)]
*  But a lot of it, like there were, I don't know if there was like different allegations [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5082.2s)]
*  and stuff again, if it was against you or your company, but none of it, from what I've [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5089.96s)]
*  seen, there was never, there was never any like validity to it. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5094.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5099.72s)]
*  Right. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5100.04s)]
*  Do you believe that there was actually something going on at your company that was bad or do [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5100.679999999999s)]
*  you believe that other people, like at a certain point, if your company is doing so well that [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5104.599999999999s)]
*  other companies are outside dark interests, get upset and try to lead like reporters or [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5110.36s)]
*  create like a negative buzz? [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5117.32s)]
*  Is that a crazy question? [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5120.2s)]
*  No, no, it's accurate. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5121.16s)]
*  It's the thing is, again, I have hundreds of employees that I employ full time, but [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5122.2s)]
*  I've also hired hundreds of people in the past. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5127.0s)]
*  And sometimes like, you know, sometimes we have hundreds of contractors just working [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5129.24s)]
*  on singular videos because the sets are so big. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5133.24s)]
*  So we work with lots of people. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5135.48s)]
*  It's impossible for there never to be anything negative. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5137.16s)]
*  You know, that's why you have HR and things like that. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5140.599999999999s)]
*  So, no, I mean, it would be crazy to say there's never been any issues where no one that's [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5142.76s)]
*  ever worked for me has ever been unhappy or, you know, one employees never said anything, [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5149.24s)]
*  you know, dumb to some other employee that made them want to complain or things like [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5153.16s)]
*  that. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5156.04s)]
*  So but I think the thing is, it's just obviously completely blown out of proportion. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5156.28s)]
*  Like, that's not a thing that's just particular to us. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5161.72s)]
*  Any company with hundreds of employees, obviously, there's going to occasionally be [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5163.48s)]
*  something someone says is something that's inappropriate or something that's not ideal. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5166.76s)]
*  That's where when we're made aware of it, we obviously have HR look into it. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5170.92s)]
*  Or if it's something serious, we'll bring in an outside third party, have them look into it and [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5174.92s)]
*  just tell us what to do. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5178.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5179.72s)]
*  I mean, it's weird for you because if something happens at Nike, then it's like there's an [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5179.96s)]
*  issue. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5184.360000000001s)]
*  There's something happened at Nike. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5184.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5185.96s)]
*  If something happens at a production company and you're are basically the fact you were [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5186.12s)]
*  exactly the business, then a lot of it probably just feel like I have people I employ that [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5190.4400000000005s)]
*  I've never met in my life. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5194.76s)]
*  I probably never will. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5195.96s)]
*  I mean, because we just have so many people and some of them don't work in my hometown [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5196.76s)]
*  and things like that. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5201.08s)]
*  So yeah, I mean, the answer is like, yeah, it's absurd to think that hundreds of people [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5201.72s)]
*  or sometimes over a thousand when we scale up contractors working together all these [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5207.88s)]
*  hours that they'll never be any issues. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5211.56s)]
*  And yeah, all I can really do is make sure I'm not creating an environment where we're [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5214.6s)]
*  influencing that, which we're doing our best. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5219.4s)]
*  And then when those kinds of things happen, just bring in someone to look into it and [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5221.64s)]
*  just be like, yo, tell me what to do because I'm a fucking YouTuber. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5227.4800000000005s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5229.64s)]
*  Right. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5230.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5230.4400000000005s)]
*  You know, if someone says something like, you know, hey there, darling or whatever, [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5230.76s)]
*  and then someone that person feels like that was inappropriate. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5235.080000000001s)]
*  Like, I don't want to be the judge of that. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5237.88s)]
*  I don't want someone in my company to be a judge of it. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5239.8s)]
*  I want to bring someone in and be like, yo, talk to them, gather the facts and you tell [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5241.400000000001s)]
*  me what I'm supposed to do, which is what we do. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5245.400000000001s)]
*  And that's all I really can do. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5247.320000000001s)]
*  You know? [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5248.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5249.160000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5250.120000000001s)]
*  It would seem like, God, it would just seem like so much stuff is out of your hands when [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5250.36s)]
*  it's got to be tough when you're a creator, you know, because you want to be do every, [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5253.4s)]
*  you know, you kind of want to do everything and have it as a business scales. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5257.639999999999s)]
*  It's kind of tough because you can't, you know, what else would I want to ask you about? [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5260.2s)]
*  Oh, I wanted to ask you about the flashcards. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5264.839999999999s)]
*  Sorry, dude. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5267.32s)]
*  I know it's cool. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5267.88s)]
*  I went as long as I could. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5269.0s)]
*  That's about that was a long for me. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5271.88s)]
*  So yeah, like you've had, like we were talking earlier about like philanthropy. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5274.2s)]
*  So you had like you've taken plastics out of the ocean. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5277.0s)]
*  You put help people with eyesight. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5280.84s)]
*  You put the water, you've done water wells in Africa or Zambia. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5286.52s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5290.36s)]
*  In Africa, in Africa. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5290.92s)]
*  Well, across Zambia or Africa. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5291.72s)]
*  Did you like what is, is there like a overall goal of like a big crazy vision you see for the [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5293.8s)]
*  future of like some sort of philanthropic idea for us or just in general? [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5301.48s)]
*  Yeah, just in general could be anything. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5306.6s)]
*  Well, the thing I've been focusing most of my time on in that area recently is [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5309.72s)]
*  so for festivals, obviously chocolate is made of cocoa. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5314.84s)]
*  There's a lot of unethical stuff that goes on a cocoa farms. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5317.64s)]
*  I don't know if you're aware of that. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5320.280000000001s)]
*  I've used. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5322.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, it depends on what kind of farms we're talking about. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5322.92s)]
*  But I yeah, well, there's some definitely. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5324.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5328.200000000001s)]
*  In West Africa, like so majority of the world's cocoa comes from Cote d'Avare, Ghana. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5328.84s)]
*  It's like I believe like 70 percent of the world's cocoa and like Cote d'Avare. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5334.68s)]
*  Cote d'Avare. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5337.88s)]
*  Cote d'Avare. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5338.120000000001s)]
*  Cote d'Avare. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5339.56s)]
*  Cote d'Avare. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5340.120000000001s)]
*  Cote d'Avare. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5342.120000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5342.76s)]
*  Cote d'Avare. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5343.0s)]
*  Yeah, and then Ghana. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5343.56s)]
*  They're on the left. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5344.360000000001s)]
*  Oh, and Ghana. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5345.080000000001s)]
*  Cote d'Avare and Ghana. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5345.72s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5346.68s)]
*  Two countries are on the left side of Africa. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5347.160000000001s)]
*  Kind of like where the round part right there is like the perfect place to go grow cocoa. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5348.92s)]
*  But 46 percent of the labor on farms there, which is where almost all the [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5353.88s)]
*  cocoa in the world comes from, is child labor. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5357.96s)]
*  So it's like pretty, pretty like just a lot of things going on there. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5360.120000000001s)]
*  And so that's where I've been focusing a lot of my attention because obviously we need a lot [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5363.64s)]
*  of cocoa for feastables. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5366.92s)]
*  And so we used to get our cocoa from Peru, which ethical sourcing is not as big of a [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5368.200000000001s)]
*  problem over there. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5374.200000000001s)]
*  We use a lot of family owned farms and blah, blah, blah. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5374.76s)]
*  But the thing is, there's not enough cocoa comes from Peru to supply big chocolate. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5377.56s)]
*  And I wanted to show like so saying I ethically sourced my cocoa from Peru doesn't really [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5383.88s)]
*  prove anything because big other chocolate companies will just go, OK, but we can't do that. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5388.68s)]
*  There's not enough cocoa in Peru. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5393.8s)]
*  So like that doesn't count. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5395.160000000001s)]
*  It's not possible to ethically source cocoa in West Africa. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5396.4400000000005s)]
*  So and I knew if feastables kept growing, eventually we'd have to switch over there. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5399.320000000001s)]
*  So this past year we switched our supply chain over there and we've been just working with the [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5404.360000000001s)]
*  have you ever heard of Tony Chocolony? [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5408.84s)]
*  Probably not. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5410.280000000001s)]
*  Tony Chocolony? [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5410.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5411.72s)]
*  No. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5411.88s)]
*  And is it a real person? [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5412.04s)]
*  Well, it's a reporter who went like super deep in exposing like the chocolate industry [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5413.64s)]
*  and really interesting guy. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5418.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5420.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5420.44s)]
*  And then but and he was like, and no chocolate companies would ethically source their cocoa. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5420.6s)]
*  And he kept exposing them and none of them would be a cool guest. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5425.48s)]
*  You think? [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5428.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5428.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5428.92s)]
*  He would be awesome. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5429.08s)]
*  Wow. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5430.04s)]
*  It sounds crazy. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5430.36s)]
*  I didn't know there's bad chocolate. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5431.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5432.44s)]
*  So he started his own chocolate company to prove that you could ethically source it. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5432.68s)]
*  He called it Tony's Chocolony because it's the lonely. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5436.04s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5438.2s)]
*  I've seen those. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5438.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5439.8s)]
*  Badass baller company. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5440.36s)]
*  And so I've been working with them to figure out how we can also ethically source our chocolate [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5442.2s)]
*  because they're the only ones really doing it. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5447.48s)]
*  Clean cocoa, dude. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5449.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5450.679999999999s)]
*  So we built a supply chain with them. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5451.0s)]
*  And so like all our farmers were Fairtrade certified and then we pay our farmers a living [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5454.36s)]
*  income because a big reason why there's child labor is because farmers in West Africa just [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5458.12s)]
*  don't make enough money. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5461.5599999999995s)]
*  So it's like that is like if you're to rank the issues, like the number one issue is just [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5462.599999999999s)]
*  income. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5467.4s)]
*  They just can't even afford to hire adults. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5467.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5470.5199999999995s)]
*  They don't make enough. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5470.92s)]
*  So what they do and what we're doing for festivals is we pay there's a living income [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5471.8s)]
*  reference price where they basically look at the cost of bread, the cost of living, [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5476.76s)]
*  cost of inflation, blah, blah, blah. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5480.76s)]
*  And they go, if a farmer were to sell you a metric ton of beans, if they don't get paid [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5482.52s)]
*  this number, then they won't be able to make a living income. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5487.08s)]
*  They won't be able to live, which then means they'll be forced to use child labor because [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5490.4400000000005s)]
*  if not, it's like they're that's the only way they'll be able to survive. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5493.96s)]
*  Right. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5497.0s)]
*  So they have to have children working. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5497.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5498.76s)]
*  So they need to make and I'm paraphrasing this in my high stuff, but they need to make [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5499.0s)]
*  this theoretical number, which is living in income reference price. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5502.68s)]
*  And so that's what we guarantee our farmers. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5505.24s)]
*  So if they theoretically sell us the cocoa, a metric ton of cocoa for less than that, [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5507.32s)]
*  we'll pay a premium on top and be like, no, here's extra money. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5513.0s)]
*  This is what you need to make so you can actually live. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5515.72s)]
*  But we don't want child labor on the farm. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5518.52s)]
*  So we'll guarantee you'll make this much. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5521.08s)]
*  But I don't want to see fucking nine year old Timmy on the cocoa farm. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5523.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5527.32s)]
*  So that's like the big thing. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5528.4400000000005s)]
*  And then do like they have farm coaches that because another way to help farmers make more [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5531.080000000001s)]
*  money is not just pay them more, but it's also help them get more yield out of their farms. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5535.96s)]
*  So they have coaches that will help counsel them and theoretically try to help them get [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5539.64s)]
*  five or 10 percent more yield out of the same hectares they have. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5543.400000000001s)]
*  Can you give them some supplies? [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5546.76s)]
*  It's like very like all about getting it because it's an income problem for a lot of them. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5548.200000000001s)]
*  Why they're using child labor. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5552.68s)]
*  You could go to the farm and be like, stop using child labor. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5554.200000000001s)]
*  But if they can't survive, the family can't eat if the kids don't also work. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5557.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5561.96s)]
*  So that's that's been a big journey. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5562.36s)]
*  I actually spent recently a week in Ghana just going through the whole supply chain. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5565.72s)]
*  So I worked on the farm, you know, and then you laid the crack, the pods laid out to dry [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5569.32s)]
*  and then saw like where they dry and then where they store the beans and even how like [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5573.72s)]
*  the government like does QC on the beans went through the whole thing all the way to the ship. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5577.64s)]
*  So this has been the last year, probably like a good fucking chunk of my time has been going [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5582.84s)]
*  to like figure out ethical sourcing with them because it's very like it's very expensive. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5587.64s)]
*  You know, so I just want to make sure we're doing it right. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5591.96s)]
*  And yeah. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5593.72s)]
*  And also that's a way of that's really a big form of philanthropy itself because, [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5595.48s)]
*  you know, just teaching these people how to do how to have more success in their own lives. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5600.36s)]
*  I mean, that kind of stuff is huge. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5605.16s)]
*  You teach one person in an area and then they can be a leader and teach other people. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5606.28s)]
*  It's like you don't even know that's kind of the. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5609.56s)]
*  Well, the bigger thing is I hope to like I hope to get it where if feastables keeps growing, [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5611.0s)]
*  where we can be like, look, we're a big chocolate company and we're ethically sourced [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5618.36s)]
*  and we're profitable. So then we can look at other big talk companies and go, [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5622.84s)]
*  you have no excuse. Right. Right now, they can all just say it's impossible. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5626.12s)]
*  You don't understand. You know, you don't have scale at companies our size. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5629.64s)]
*  This is like this is a fairy tale dream. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5633.72s)]
*  But because no one's doing it, you know, that's actually doing serious revenue. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5635.96s)]
*  So if we can get to that point where theoretically we're selling a billion dollars a year of chocolate [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5639.72s)]
*  and it's ethically sourced and is profitable, then they have an excuse. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5643.8s)]
*  Exactly. So like because there's over a million kids in child labor [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5647.320000000001s)]
*  and on cocoa farms in West Africa right now. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5650.6s)]
*  Yeah. And like feastables itself is not going to be able to get all a million out. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5653.08s)]
*  But if we could theoretically get tens of thousands of kids out of child labor [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5655.88s)]
*  and then use that in my platform and stuff like this to bully everyone else, [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5659.16s)]
*  then hopefully that can create a snowball that gets hundreds of thousands of kids. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5663.72s)]
*  Yeah. Big chocolates going down, boy. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5667.08s)]
*  I like that. I mean, it's just I hate three musketeers. I'll say it out loud. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5669.639999999999s)]
*  And when people eat them and I'll say this when people eat them, I judge them. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5674.36s)]
*  No comment. I don't want to get sued. Yeah. I'm just saying I don't like. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5679.0s)]
*  Yeah. He does not like three musketeers. And I can say that. Can I? [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5682.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you can say that. Yeah. Yeah. I don't like them. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5685.639999999999s)]
*  I could say I don't like three musketeers either. Not because of anything. Just I don't like. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5688.28s)]
*  Oh, no. I don't know any other behaviors. I don't know what they're doing before [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5693.24s)]
*  they mail it to me or whatever. I don't like it. I never have liked it. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5695.88s)]
*  And I don't even believe in it. Yeah. Which is also a way that I feel about it. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5699.56s)]
*  Like when I open it up, I don't even I don't even believe in it. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5702.92s)]
*  And paydays, the nuts aren't any good in them anymore. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5706.28s)]
*  And they were better when they were paid. I feel like if they had like a little more [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5709.56s)]
*  saltiness, a little more nuts, those things would be the bomb. Yeah. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5714.2s)]
*  It's the chewy stuff in the middle is just a little too overpowering. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5716.76s)]
*  Now, I agree. Yeah. Paydays are like so close to being a phenomenal product. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5719.24s)]
*  And the nuts used to be a little more than more edges on the look like more nuts. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5722.92s)]
*  Bro, I relate. I had a payday recently. I thought the same thing. I was like this [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5727.320000000001s)]
*  like fucking shit in the middle. It's just not there's no flavor. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5730.360000000001s)]
*  I want more fucking salt. It fell off for me. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5733.400000000001s)]
*  And I don't know when my mom used to get them. Sometimes it would be like a special thing [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5735.8s)]
*  that she would get, but she would let us watch her eat them. I'm going to tell you this. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5739.320000000001s)]
*  Did you ever dealt with like you're so big on YouTube. Do you ever deal with sanctions [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5744.12s)]
*  and stuff on there? Have you had to deal with that? Is that a conversation you have with them? [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5747.240000000001s)]
*  Sanctions like or do or they say like you can't do certain things like you have to like submit [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5750.28s)]
*  all your videos and like go through a process like that. Well, can we even talk about that? [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5754.5199999999995s)]
*  Or we can we can talk about the conspiracy theorists are going to run away with this. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5759.88s)]
*  But a lot of there's when there's like a higher ad, what is it when you get bigger, [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5763.5599999999995s)]
*  there's like Google preferred or whatever where it's like for bigger advertisers like Coke or [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5771.639999999999s)]
*  whatever, like premium advertisers, they want to make sure they're not advertising on bad content. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5776.76s)]
*  So like for bigger channels, YouTube, if they'll review your video before it goes up just to make [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5781.4800000000005s)]
*  sure it's clean and you're not just like saying Hitler a thousand times to make sure it's good [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5786.360000000001s)]
*  for bigger advertisers. So they review it for that, but they do that for I believe thousands [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5791.56s)]
*  of creators right now, which you know, but you don't have to do that. It just helps you get higher [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5795.64s)]
*  ad rates. But no, I mean, I just post whatever they don't know what I'm doing or anything. And [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5799.400000000001s)]
*  they're they're pretty chill. Like, do you think they're in a tough position with what just like [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5804.68s)]
*  having to set up parameters for different videos and like the effect that it could have on certain [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5810.6s)]
*  people and that sort of thing? Like, I always just think about it from my perspective. I'm always like, [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5814.52s)]
*  we're upset, you know, sometimes like, oh, they'll make us take a joke or this joke or this sort of [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5818.6s)]
*  thing. They may not, you know, well, the thing is, they're not making you take it out. They're [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5822.360000000001s)]
*  just saying if you don't take it out, you won't get higher ad rates. That's a good point. Think [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5826.04s)]
*  of any brand that spends a billion dollars a year marketing. That's them say, hey, YouTube, [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5828.92s)]
*  if they hear if any of these things are in a video, we don't want to be on it. And YouTube just going, [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5832.68s)]
*  hey, take this out or we can't put these premium ads on you, which I think makes perfect sense. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5836.52s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Sometimes I only look at it from my perspective. I'm not able to [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5840.52s)]
*  look at it from like, oh, also, this is a platform where they allow us to put our stuff up. Exactly. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5843.400000000001s)]
*  And then so they also are trying to do business as well. Yeah. No. What else do we have here? [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5848.04s)]
*  We're almost done. I mean, we can keep going. I'm having fun. You don't drink, right? I've maybe [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5854.04s)]
*  drank like five times in my life. I don't like the way it makes me feel. It's like, is it out [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5859.56s)]
*  of control that it makes you feel you think? No, it just like was I didn't drink alcohol. So I was [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5863.8s)]
*  like 23 or 24. I wanted to stay the fuck away from it because I have a very addictive personality. So [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5868.76s)]
*  my goal is to go my entire life without ever drinking alcohol. But then I was like with Logan [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5873.64s)]
*  Paul one time or I was at I was at a casino gambling and then Logan Paul was there and then he was [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5878.92s)]
*  like, let's hang out. And then was it a UFC fight or something? I don't even remember. It might have [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5885.56s)]
*  been like Floyd Mayweather versus Conor McGregor or something. Oh, yeah. I don't know. But so I was [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5889.96s)]
*  like, OK, let's we can gamble together. And then we're walking to like the tables and he stops by [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5895.0s)]
*  a club. He's like, let's just go in here. It'll be one minute. I was like, oh, my God, I fucking [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5899.320000000001s)]
*  hate clubs. They're so boring. So I go in there. One minute turns into like two hours. And I'm just [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5902.120000000001s)]
*  so fucking bored. And I just caved. I was like, OK, I need to just drink. And I'd never drink my life. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5906.6s)]
*  But I'm like something I need something. I'm dying. A lot of people need a drink to be around the [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5912.12s)]
*  balls. That's what I like. That was the time I did it. And then I was just like, oh, I just kind of [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5916.5199999999995s)]
*  like feel weird. But it's not a happy word. It's just like this is I just don't like it. You don't [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5921.16s)]
*  dig it. Yeah. Yeah. I think people I think it's getting less and less popular in the world kind [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5925.8s)]
*  of especially with like younger generations. Just like they just think it's kind of dumb. Yeah. Just [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5929.56s)]
*  I don't know. I I don't know how to describe it. It's like it just makes me feel stupid. And I [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5933.72s)]
*  but not a good stupid. It's not like a happy stupid. It's like it's just dumb. Like waste of [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5940.84s)]
*  time. Yeah. I've definitely I've done a lot of that. In July you tweeted if you were to lower the [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5945.4800000000005s)]
*  age for president that you might run. Do you still think that ever? No, no, no. I mean, I might when [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5951.08s)]
*  I'm older, but not if they lowered it. That was mostly a joke. Just I knew people would freak the [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5960.52s)]
*  fuck out and talk about it. And it worked. But I would if I were to it would probably be like when [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5965.24s)]
*  I'm like 50 or 60 because I would need to like accomplish everything I want in business and stuff [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5973.5599999999995s)]
*  and then probably take like 10 years and I'd have to go be like do something at the local level and [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5978.36s)]
*  then the state level and work my way up. But yeah, we'll see. But there could be potentially a [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5983.24s)]
*  president. You never know. Oh, yeah. One 100 percent. You never know. Especially about you learn [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5987.8s)]
*  a lot. Do you as Elon ever reached out to you to do something cool together? Because I mean, [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5991.8s)]
*  you guys at a certain point, you guys are both like pioneers in certain schools of thought and [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=5995.8s)]
*  certainly creative folks. Yeah, I mean, he's pioneering taking us to Mars, electric cars, [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6002.04s)]
*  talking with your phone through your brain, digging tunnels, fixing traffic, you know, [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6007.4800000000005s)]
*  getting rid of a trillion dollars of waste in the government now and this and that. And I'm pioneering [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6012.28s)]
*  funny videos. I don't know if I put those in. But kidding. But he yeah, we bumped into each other [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6017.24s)]
*  at the Super Bowl. Said hi. I don't know. I think he asked me, do I think people call it call X [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6026.28s)]
*  Twitter still or do people call it X? And I was like, yeah, most people call it Twitter. I've [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6035.16s)]
*  noticed he's interesting. I think I was kind of like the gist of it. Yeah. And then but I'll say [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6040.599999999999s)]
*  that. No, not really. I mean, I've been in talks with people at SpaceX and even cooking ideas and [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6045.96s)]
*  things like that, but not Elon himself. Yeah. Yeah. We tried to ask if we could interview those [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6051.32s)]
*  the two people stuck up in that. Oh, my gosh. That'd be crazy. I wanted to be the first one [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6057.56s)]
*  because people are like, who you want to get on your podcast? And they're like, anybody. And I [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6062.04s)]
*  was trying to think, who can you not get in? Like, oh, somebody who's not on Earth. Yeah, that's who [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6065.4800000000005s)]
*  you got to get. Yeah, that was somebody who's just loitering or whatever, you know. And I love how [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6069.32s)]
*  they're not aliens. But yeah, it's like, all right. Do you think you could get Elon on here one day? [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6074.36s)]
*  Do you think maybe? Yeah. They just they offered to send me a Starlink if I want to get one. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6079.719999999999s)]
*  So I might get one. Are you using them? Oh, yeah. Starlink is amazing. When you're in fucking Zambia [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6084.28s)]
*  in the middle of nowhere, this is the only way. Starlink in Antarctica was amazing. Like, Antarctica, [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6088.5199999999995s)]
*  you're in the middle of nowhere. And I mean, literally the furthest from human civilization on [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6093.96s)]
*  the planet. And yeah, you can get internet. It was such a phenomenal product. Did you see anything [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6099.08s)]
*  cool like you need? Because a lot of people say in Antarctica that they're hiding secret stuff up [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6103.96s)]
*  there, that there's that kind of energy. Yeah, Antarctica. You should go to Antarctica sometime [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6107.56s)]
*  in your life. It is. Oh, I would love to go up there. So there's like, there's you go to South [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6112.6s)]
*  America and you get on a Boeing 747, like an actual commercial plane. You go to South America. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6120.52s)]
*  Yeah, you go all the way to like the very bottom of Chile. OK, Antarctica is at the bottom. Yeah. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6125.4s)]
*  Yeah. And then you board like a commercial plane, like you're flying like fucking Delta here, [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6129.4s)]
*  and it just starts flying. And you just you fly over the ocean and then you see just as [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6135.24s)]
*  just endless abyss of white snow and mountains. And you just keep flying deeper and deeper and [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6141.32s)]
*  deeper into it. And then you just see this just fucking ice runway. I mean, it's the sketchiest [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6147.24s)]
*  thing you'll ever see in your life. And it just lands this commercial airliner there. I had no [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6152.5199999999995s)]
*  idea of any of this going into it. I kind of went into it pretty raw. And you get off. It's [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6157.32s)]
*  just this janky little like ladder thing type B. It's they know. Yeah. Go down one image right [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6161.88s)]
*  there. That one click on it because they have to brush all the snow off. Yeah, that's what you land [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6168.2s)]
*  on. Just ice. And then then that's not the one we went to. But then there's just this research [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6171.24s)]
*  facility where there's like three big tents that researchers work out of. And then there's like a [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6178.5199999999995s)]
*  hundred tents that they all live out of. So there's no actual terminal? No, because there it's like [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6181.88s)]
*  so the time where it's like sun 24 7. But then there's like these intense winters like three or [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6187.16s)]
*  four months a year where it's like dark and you can't be there. So they have to pack everything [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6193.24s)]
*  up and leave. You can't leave anything behind. So it's like a temporary thing. And so we get out and [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6196.599999999999s)]
*  there's all these researchers doing experiments and cool shit. And I'm just like, hey, I'm here [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6201.48s)]
*  to film a video. So and then a snow. So we were supposed to just be there for like two days or [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6205.8s)]
*  three days or whatever. But a snowstorm hits. So what we are going to do is just go out in a random [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6211.639999999999s)]
*  direction and then just set up a camp in the middle of nowhere in Antarctica and try to survive [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6215.72s)]
*  for 50 hours. But there was an intense snowstorm. So we're just we had to sit in these research [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6219.400000000001s)]
*  facilities and wait them out. And one of them was so crazy. It's like this tent with like door [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6223.56s)]
*  and it like flew the door, flung it open. It was so intense that we had to like tight, like pull the [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6229.96s)]
*  door shut because it's like like barreling snow. And I'm like, my God, I think we're going to die. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6235.240000000001s)]
*  Like it was crazy. They're like, we haven't had a storm like this in a while. And like you have like [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6241.0s)]
*  all these little tents that you live in and like the big communal tents for the where everyone [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6246.4400000000005s)]
*  hangs out and stuff. And the little tent, like we had to build like actual snow walls around our [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6250.2s)]
*  tent because there's so much wind blowing that like our tents would have got swept away. So we [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6254.92s)]
*  had to I had to barricade the I'm like, this is just the normal thing. They're like, yeah, [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6259.16s)]
*  that's just what happens. And so you're like building a wall around your, you know, [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6262.6s)]
*  metal pole reinforced tent that you're going to sleep in. And like when the winds would pick [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6266.92s)]
*  up at night, I'm like, fuck. It's like, is my tent just going to fly off? [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6271.4s)]
*  And there's nowhere to run to. Yeah, you just run to the bigger tent. But it's like, it was crazy. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6275.16s)]
*  You know, and also in Antarctica, probably it's like you can't pee or shit in the snow or anything [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6279.8s)]
*  because you can't leave anything behind. Like that's massively illegal. And so everything, [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6285.16s)]
*  all your waste and stuff you have to store and carry and hold and that kind of stuff. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6290.28s)]
*  Fly back with it? Well, they will. But you'll just put it in like like a piss tank or the hold [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6293.8s)]
*  onto it and the shit in the shit bag that this big shit thing they had. But also you get snow [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6298.4400000000005s)]
*  blindness because everything's white and the sun reflects. So you have to wear glasses when you go [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6305.96s)]
*  outside or you'll literally blind you, which was like, that was crazy. Yeah. Imagine first of all, [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6310.4400000000005s)]
*  you're almost blind, can't shit. Yeah. Well, so you wear these like tinted glasses. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6315.400000000001s)]
*  Even doing it. But you're 80 years old. It's so beautiful, though. It's like crazy to just see [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6320.92s)]
*  you're just in the middle of nowhere. It feels like you're on a different planet. And it was like, [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6327.72s)]
*  sometimes you just walk outside, you just walk in a direction, you just see nothing anywhere. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6333.08s)]
*  And it was awesome. Is there a zoo or anything like that? No, there's not. Is there any? [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6337.0s)]
*  No animals, nothing. No roads or nothing. No, there's really nothing there. I mean, and like, [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6341.16s)]
*  so after the snowstorm calmed down, we just went out, like got on these like little skis or things [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6345.96s)]
*  went far away. But this is where it gets scary because there's crevasses and ravines and things [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6351.88s)]
*  like that. So you could be walking and then just fall a hundred feet and die. Right. Because there's [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6357.88s)]
*  like the snow could have like slightly piled up over like a hundred foot gap in between the ice [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6362.52s)]
*  or things like that. So you have to have like this device go on in front of you that checks to make [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6367.08s)]
*  sure there's not just like a giant hole you're going to fall in. You have to mark everything. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6371.16s)]
*  So we go out in this random direction, scan everything. And then we scanned like this little [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6374.92s)]
*  like hundred foot square foot perimeter, put up flags and it's like, guys, if you walk across those [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6381.16s)]
*  flags, there's a chance you'll fucking die. So boys stay within this unless we scan more areas. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6385.4s)]
*  And then, yeah, we just started setting up tents, raw dog in it in the middle of nowhere, [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6390.68s)]
*  Antarctica, far away from the research facilities. And it was it was a fucking awesome experience. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6394.2s)]
*  And then there's this mountain that no one had any records of someone climbing. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6399.88s)]
*  So we climbed this pretty tall mountain. And so I got to name it, which I named it Shopify [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6403.72s)]
*  because they sponsored the video and helped make the whole thing happen. But so but like it was [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6409.96s)]
*  crazy, man. Climbing up this mountain. And I just I had no idea how we did that. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6414.6s)]
*  Can you pull it up? Just like go to the 50 hours in Antarctica. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6421.4800000000005s)]
*  Is it nice? Like and there's no people there's not like an artican. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6424.84s)]
*  You can't go to a bar. Nothing. There's nothing. No, there's literally nothing. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6428.76s)]
*  Like this is research facility. Do you think there's crazy stuff going on down there? [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6431.56s)]
*  Like they say there's a lot of no, I don't think there's anything I didn't. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6435.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. See, look at that. Wow. It's fucking crazy. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6440.6s)]
*  Yeah, we were deep in there. And it's super cold, huh? [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6445.0s)]
*  Yeah, it depends on the time there there. Well, so the problem is like when you move around [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6449.160000000001s)]
*  and you have so many layers, you start to heat up and then you take the clothes off [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6454.280000000001s)]
*  and you get really cold. Yeah. See, look where we went to. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6456.76s)]
*  Is there a chance that at one point it was thawed out and it was a normal land [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6459.4s)]
*  and we'll be able to explore it one day and we just don't know or that's complete? [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6462.92s)]
*  Well, there's it's not straight like those are real rocks and stuff. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6466.04s)]
*  So it's ice on top of stuff. So, yeah, there is land. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6468.839999999999s)]
*  And it is crazy that oh, my God. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6471.96s)]
*  Yeah, look at that snowstorm we got hit with. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6474.92s)]
*  So this is after we left the research facility and now we're going to set up camp. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6476.92s)]
*  And like, yeah, those are the goggles you have to wear to not go blind. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6481.96s)]
*  And then right here is where it's like a human. I did a rod kind of. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6486.28s)]
*  Oh, that's the island. That's the mountain you named. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6488.84s)]
*  No, no, that's just like, yeah, the mountains behind us over there. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6491.16s)]
*  And then this is a setting of our tents and just I mean, we're just a bunch of stupid kids. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6495.32s)]
*  I don't I don't know how we pulled this off. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6498.84s)]
*  Yeah, you could have lost a kid easy. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6501.24s)]
*  Well, yeah, obviously we had a safety expert there. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6503.8s)]
*  But yeah, but obviously that's it. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6505.8s)]
*  Then just skip ahead like to towards the end where you see me climbing up the mountain. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6507.400000000001s)]
*  It's probably it. Yeah, I don't know. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6510.52s)]
*  Maybe after this or before it. I just wanted to see. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6513.08s)]
*  Or yeah, and that's just an ice thing. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6516.12s)]
*  You're in. Yeah, keep going to the left. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6518.44s)]
*  That igloo. No, that's the tent, but it's metal reinforce. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6520.2s)]
*  Yeah, to the right a little bit. Yeah, right there. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6522.84s)]
*  Just hit it. Right click a couple or double tap. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6524.44s)]
*  Yeah. So look at this right here. This is us climbing up the mountain. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6528.92s)]
*  Look at those views. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6531.96s)]
*  It's fucking gnarly. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6534.599999999999s)]
*  Oh, shopify. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6536.2s)]
*  Yeah, I did an ad read. I was like, what's what's the most interesting time I can do an ad read? [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6538.44s)]
*  I was like where people wouldn't click off. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6543.32s)]
*  I was like, you know, I'm climbing this mountain. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6544.759999999999s)]
*  It'll probably be more interesting. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6546.759999999999s)]
*  Do you think you'll get to do a video with Kim Jong Un ever? [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6549.639999999999s)]
*  I mean. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6554.44s)]
*  Like a game show to help some of his citizens. [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6556.28s)]
*  Feel like they would think it's Western propaganda. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6559.639999999999s)]
*  I don't think they would let me. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6562.28s)]
*  You know, when I first started uploading in China, [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6564.04s)]
*  they're like they called me like a American capitalist or whatever. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6567.24s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6893.0s)]
*  Well, that's relationships. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6894.04s)]
*  Just even outside of dating have always been a problem for me because like I, [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6895.88s)]
*  I think this might've been a traumatic experience because I still picture it to this day and [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6900.44s)]
*  occasionally have dreams of it. [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6904.76s)]
*  But I remember when I was like 15 or 16, like I've, cause I'm so obsessed with YouTube. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6905.639999999999s)]
*  I remember like at lunch one time, like one person literally just looked me dead in the [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6911.08s)]
*  eyes and said, do you know how to talk about anything besides fucking YouTube? [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6916.6s)]
*  And I, that like, and I was like, whoa. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6920.36s)]
*  And I like, and then I was like, okay, I'm going to not talk about YouTube. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6923.8s)]
*  And then, so I just didn't talk like, and like at one point someone unironically asked [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6927.64s)]
*  me if I was mute, like, cause I was just like, in my head, I was like, well, people think I [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6931.96s)]
*  talk about YouTube too much. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6936.04s)]
*  I don't know anything else besides YouTube. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6937.5599999999995s)]
*  And so I just didn't know what to do. [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6939.0s)]
*  And it was like very like traumatic for me because I was so fucking obsessed with it [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6940.2s)]
*  growing up. [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6945.5599999999995s)]
*  And the problem is though, right. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6946.12s)]
*  And back then I thought, okay, I'm a freak of nature. [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6947.88s)]
*  I'm the problem. [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6951.32s)]
*  And I tried to, I tried to watch South Park and I think it's a good show, but I just didn't [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6952.2s)]
*  find it interesting. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6955.88s)]
*  And, and my like opportunity cost brain back then was like, no, I need to be working. [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6956.76s)]
*  This is blah, blah, blah. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6961.4s)]
*  And so I just never related to anyone. [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6962.679999999999s)]
*  I thought it was because I'm a freak and it's all me, me, me. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6964.76s)]
*  But then I, as I, when I was like 18 or 19, I got a little smarter. [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6967.24s)]
*  I realized, no, it's just in my school, there just weren't people who were interested in [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6971.16s)]
*  the same things as me. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6974.76s)]
*  And so I was like, that's, but it is what it is. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6975.5599999999995s)]
*  I don't need to change who I am. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6978.12s)]
*  I just need to change the people around. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6979.24s)]
*  And that was like a big turning point for me. [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6980.36s)]
*  And so, no, I don't struggle with the relationships. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6983.08s)]
*  Well, I mean, if you just put me in a room with someone who doesn't, isn't trying to [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6986.2s)]
*  achieve anything or doesn't want to do anything extraordinary and just wants to play video [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6991.08s)]
*  games and blah, blah, blah. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6994.44s)]
*  Like, yeah. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6995.639999999999s)]
*  I mean, I wouldn't relate to him. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6996.2s)]
*  I'd be a struggle. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6997.16s)]
*  But you put me in a room with someone who is building a business and trying to do something [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=6999.32s)]
*  cool. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7003.24s)]
*  I mean, we could probably talk for 10 hours straight. [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7004.12s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7006.04s)]
*  So it's just all who you're around. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7006.679999999999s)]
*  It's just those people are pretty rare and you don't just stumble into them. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7007.96s)]
*  You have to be very diligent to have those kind of people in your life. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7010.76s)]
*  So, yeah, that just putting myself around the right kind of people has helped like crazy. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7014.76s)]
*  And my current girlfriend, she's amazing. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7019.72s)]
*  She understands that, like, you know, growing the channel, making great content and [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7021.8s)]
*  right now with feastables because we're trying to build an ethical supply chain. [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7025.96s)]
*  So I'm doing this on fucking steroid hard mode and all these other things I'm trying [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7028.92s)]
*  to do. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7032.4400000000005s)]
*  It's like it's not easy. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7032.68s)]
*  And like, you know, she gets it. [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7033.72s)]
*  You know, like there are just some days where I won't be able to come home. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7036.76s)]
*  There are just some days where, you know, I'm going to film for 16 hours and I'm going [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7039.08s)]
*  to I will come home and I don't even know if my eyes will be open. [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7042.36s)]
*  Like, I'm going to come home and just pass out because it was so intense. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7045.400000000001s)]
*  And so it's great. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7047.88s)]
*  Like, and we we communicate really well and that kind of stuff. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7049.400000000001s)]
*  And I'm very happy. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7052.6s)]
*  But yeah, I guess that's kind of the gist. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7053.56s)]
*  Like, did you have to say, like, will you can I subscribe to your heart or something [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7055.56s)]
*  like that? [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7058.6s)]
*  Like, you know, I it's actually nice, though, because one thing I've found is because we're [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7058.84s)]
*  not robots. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7065.8s)]
*  You do have to take time off, even though I hate that you can't work all the time. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7066.360000000001s)]
*  And so I found that in the past, I would just like if I went eight days, like really [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7069.88s)]
*  hard or nine days, like sometimes I could get it to 10 or 12 in a row, I would just [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7073.56s)]
*  like wake up and just feel like shit and crash. [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7077.8s)]
*  And I need to like watch an anime or something to like decompress and blah, blah. [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7080.2s)]
*  But I found like if I consistently spend time with my girlfriend, I don't like boil up to [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7084.28s)]
*  this point where I'm so stressed and I need to crash. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7088.6s)]
*  I'm losing my mind at borderline going to have a mental breakdown. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7091.4s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7093.88s)]
*  Yeah, I kind of navigated a little bit. [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7094.36s)]
*  Yeah, it's like, you know, because then I get these like decompression shots when I [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7095.88s)]
*  hang out with her more consistently, because it's like, you know, when you just go home [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7099.4800000000005s)]
*  alone to an empty bed, it's like, what do you do? [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7103.08s)]
*  But I just sit there and think about work. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7104.84s)]
*  But if you have this beautiful woman, you know, you're like, I'm going to go home and [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7106.2s)]
*  beautiful woman. [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7109.24s)]
*  You're like, oh, this is cool. [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7109.88s)]
*  Let's talk about things. [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7111.08s)]
*  And it's like helps you like take your mind off work. [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7112.04s)]
*  So I've noticed that's been a good benefit is like they don't I just don't have like [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7113.96s)]
*  borderline mental breakdowns as often. [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7119.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7121.639999999999s)]

*  They're very welcoming. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7193.72s)]
*  You made sure I had two cans of Celsius. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7194.84s)]
*  That was awesome. [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7197.56s)]
*  And just all around a good environment and everything. [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7198.6s)]
*  Thanks, man. [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7201.88s)]
*  Well, we'll see about that. [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7202.68s)]
*  Mr. Beast. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7206.04s)]
*  See, am I the only one? [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7206.76s)]
*  All right, to close it on this, am I the only one that feels uncomfortable when people talk about you like that? [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7208.52s)]
*  Oh, I can't see. [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7212.200000000001s)]
*  It makes me really uncomfortable. [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7212.84s)]
*  I can't wait for them to get done saying something nice. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7215.320000000001s)]
*  And I've had to train myself to just sit there and take it because I used to always change the subject. [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7218.68s)]
*  And it would make it even more uncomfortable because and then kind of awkward. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7222.92s)]
*  So now I've just like practice like doing this because before I noticed my default would always just be to these people start complimenting and I just change the subject. [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7225.96s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, me too. [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7235.8s)]
*  I'll be like, oh, that's sweet of you to say we should go outdoors. [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7237.24s)]
*  That's what I'll say. [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7239.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I'd be like, yeah, interesting. [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7240.04s)]
*  Anyway, so it's very sweet of you. [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7241.64s)]
*  I was wondering the other day if the Jets will win anything this year and people were like, what are we even? [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7244.36s)]
*  You know, but yeah, it's gotten yes. [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7248.36s)]
*  Sometimes you navigate it a little bit better as time goes on. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7250.12s)]
*  You know, is this brand also paying? [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7252.52s)]
*  No, I just like their water. [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7254.84s)]
*  So Celsius had to pay. [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7256.2s)]
*  These guys got it for free. [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7258.04s)]
*  Yeah, but we'd like to get a water. [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7259.5599999999995s)]
*  My goal one day is to make a water. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7261.32s)]
*  Let's see if that makes them. [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7263.0s)]
*  This is my goal to make a water. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7264.84s)]
*  Right. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7266.76s)]
*  I want to have a hat like a wellness facility for people recovering from addiction. [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7267.16s)]
*  Oh, OK. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7271.5599999999995s)]
*  And it's on land that has an aquifer so they can access water. [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7272.28s)]
*  And the people that are getting well are helping to create like. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7276.28s)]
*  So you employ the people with addiction so you get them out. [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7279.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7282.44s)]
*  And then the water gets sold and the money goes to the facility. [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7282.92s)]
*  So it's like because so many people have been ruined by addiction that our government supported. [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7286.76s)]
*  Right. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7290.76s)]
*  Or didn't really combat like an opioid epidemic. [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7291.0s)]
*  So I'm like, well, how do you beat them and you get something everybody needs that's clean for people, which is water. [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7293.72s)]
*  And then every time they drink by it, they're helping somebody get clean. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7299.16s)]
*  You know, or what if you give them drugs and they go sell drugs and then they just put their addiction to good use. [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7303.08s)]
*  Oh, I see what you're talking about. [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7311.4s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, I feel like that do better because they probably know the drug landscape and other addicts really well. [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7312.44s)]
*  Oh, that's a good point. You're kind of putting them in a whole new territory. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7320.12s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. I feel like just lean into what they're good at. [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7322.28s)]
*  They're a drug addict. Just sell drugs. [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7324.759999999999s)]
*  You know, we'll try both. [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7327.32s)]
*  We'll try both. [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7328.36s)]
*  You know, and we'll get some. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7329.0s)]
*  All right. He's been trying to end this for like five minutes. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7331.24s)]
*  All right. [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7333.32s)]
*  Bye. [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7333.719999999999s)]
*  The stone. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7342.919999999999s)]
*  But when I reach that ground, I'll share this piece of my life. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7346.599999999999s)]
*  I can feel it in my bones. [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOP0VDb2rAg&t=7350.919999999999s)]
