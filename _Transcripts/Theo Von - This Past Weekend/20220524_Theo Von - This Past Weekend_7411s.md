*  I'll sit and tell you [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=66.82s)]
*  Yeah, you know what I've been realizing is [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=87.9s)]
*  What's dicey to me is if they get those little? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=91.02000000000001s)]
*  Sandwiches, you know the ones dumb the little [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=94.86s)]
*  May cut sandwiches. Yeah, you know what I'm saying. I'm like a row cut up [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=98.30000000000001s)]
*  No, no, but more like just like the square ones and then somebody cuts it up like that, you know, I'm talking about [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=103.94s)]
*  Like the triangle pieces actually, I know I'm trying to picture it though [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=109.38000000000001s)]
*  So yeah, it just says meat cheese man and mustard man or mayonnaise in it [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=112.78s)]
*  Yeah, it just like is a little triangle. Yeah, you know somebody gets that little round tray of a bunch of those little [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=117.26s)]
*  Yes, now I got you. Yeah [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=123.22s)]
*  But then the weird part is when they start to sit there for a while and it gets hard on the side and people still eat [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=125.3s)]
*  Yeah [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=130.98000000000002s)]
*  That's why you gotta get to that plate early, but it's some guys prefer air damage [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=132.06s)]
*  Yes, some guys prefer to go into the tray late in the game [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=136.66s)]
*  Yeah, that's not the way you got to get there before the air damage. Yeah, it up. Yeah. Yeah, that is air damage, man [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=143.22s)]
*  Yeah, there's a triangular. Yeah, you know what I'm talking about. Those triangular ones [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=149.61999999999998s)]
*  Are you talking about they come in like a plastic plate you pull it off? Yes. I know exactly talking about yeah [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=153.38s)]
*  And they get the top on it. Yeah [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=158.89999999999998s)]
*  Convenient way to throw a party. Yeah. Yeah, I don't got to make sandwiches if you if it's just [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=161.26s)]
*  Yeah better that way. Yeah, I think having it like that is probably mixing. Uh [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=166.66s)]
*  Yeah, somebody cracks open to think of those as a kid I hate this I was like, oh those things look like they're for adults or [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=171.62s)]
*  But as an adult, I'm like, I'll have a one or two of those. Yeah [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=178.29999999999998s)]
*  Nice. Yeah, it's a perfect. You can't go back [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=182.14s)]

*  I don't know what's happening. Yeah, and I don't know [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=407.42s)]
*  I think it's like a stick [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=409.09999999999997s)]
*  I think they got to go to court like maybe Johnny and Amber to solve it figure it out [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=409.98s)]
*  Yeah, cuz I shouldn't who's bad son. Yeah, I feel like Johnny is Russia in this scenario. Mm-hmm and Amber [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=413.86s)]
*  No, I'm sorry Johnny. Yeah, Johnny's Johnny's Ukraine. I'm sorry and Amber's Russia and [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=420.98s)]
*  No [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=427.78s)]
*  Yeah, who's the bad there's only two ways to do it. I don't know [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=429.1s)]
*  The good guys are Ukraine. I'm trying to depend on it depends on which side of the political aisle [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=433.18s)]
*  You I guess you fall on to consider who's the bad guy. Yeah, but I think [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=438.06s)]
*  Johnny yeah is Ukraine Johnny cuz he got invaded by Amber [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=442.46000000000004s)]
*  So we need to figure out ways to funnel weapons to Johnny. Yeah, that's what we got to do to help out Johnny [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=447.66s)]
*  Yeah, I saw Johnny Depp one night at the Comedy Store it was pretty crazy [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=455.1s)]
*  That is a crazy sighting to see Johnny because I went up in a [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=459.54s)]
*  Doug Stanhope his friends with the introduction to him and then I realized I didn't know what to say and then I realized I didn't [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=462.98s)]
*  Have anything to say to Johnny Depp, right? That's almost the worst [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=467.58000000000004s)]
*  But like when you're like, oh, there's not even there's not even a thirtieth degree of separation [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=470.78000000000003s)]
*  It's like there's nothing to even say here. It's like literally shook hands and then I [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=476.02s)]
*  Had nothing yeah, I it would cut it's kind of similar to meeting you because what I wanted to say [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=481.98s)]
*  I held it [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=488.14000000000004s)]
*  Maybe what you wanted to say you held it because you felt like he's he's over it [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=488.66s)]
*  Like I would have opened with a 21 Jump Street thing because that's my closest emotional tie to Johnny [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=492.34000000000003s)]
*  Okay, was his hair back then with the earring [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=497.42s)]
*  He kind of said that that my generation pull that picture of a Johnny Depp 21 Jump Street. Let's get an image of that [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=500.1s)]
*  I think he was like the that hairstyle with the earring was like every white guy in America [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=505.58000000000004s)]
*  Did that middle part with the earring and so I would open with a 21 Jump Street like with you I [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=510.5s)]
*  Roll rules, but I didn't want to say it. I know you rode rules. I remember. Oh, that's interesting [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=515.66s)]
*  Yeah, and you're as big as I thought you were like tall you're a tall drink of water [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=519.98s)]
*  You know, it's really funny people say that I'm tall and I don't I don't I've always just been I mean [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=523.7s)]
*  I've been this height for probably 21 years now and it's like I don't think anything [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=529.46s)]
*  I never thought I was tall but people constantly say that yeah [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=533.74s)]
*  bro, you're taller than I thought [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=537.62s)]
*  So it's always Mexican comment on it [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=539.7s)]
*  But it's a lot of like Latinos, you know or recent Americans [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=544.34s)]
*  Who are like? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=549.86s)]
*  Recent American is a better way than to call Mexican. It's a way to scoot around [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=553.82s)]
*  Well, not even Mexican, but just I feel like if we're gonna be because people remember that people used to say illegal immigrants [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=557.58s)]

*  Money right out of the tip thing. He did. Yeah, and um, so the scat you were like an accessory to the crime [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=787.46s)]
*  Then we didn't tell him to scat. He would have bothered the girls and may not have he could have done a rape and burgle [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=793.98s)]
*  Oh, yeah, it's hard to know what would have happened right that could have been the lesser of the two evils [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=800.1s)]
*  Well, then I go in and there's a guy in there who's like [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=804.9200000000001s)]

*  Yeah, it doesn't seem like they need that. Yeah, you could just go like this [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=837.46s)]
*  It's like ordering a sandwich at Wawa's you like why can't I just give it the order to you? [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=841.0400000000001s)]

*  Oh a lot of unnecessary technology and so then uh, yeah, but it was just crazy. They were everybody was just so like [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=851.0s)]
*  Like nobody there could have saved the day right, you know, because they had this one little mighty mouse bitch in there [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=858.0999999999999s)]
*  I think if she'd have seen it go down she wouldn't she was dealing with an egg [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=864.4599999999999s)]
*  Mc, you know date breakfast or something at the moment when that thing and when the guy hit but if she'd have freaking turned around [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=867.86s)]
*  She was a little less hungry. She might have took her focus off the order and helped [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=873.86s)]
*  well, she you could just tell she had a little bit more nuts in her than any of the [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=878.2199999999999s)]
*  Fellas that were working in there, right? You know, right? They don't care, right? They don't care [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=882.42s)]
*  But it was the tips though. Oh [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=886.62s)]
*  They care about that [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=889.3399999999999s)]
*  But I would uh, yeah. Yeah, that's my money. Like, you know, nobody stopped them [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=891.06s)]
*  No, the guy was just like one guy. This is the best one dude who probably was at least, you know [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=895.66s)]
*  Four or five different genders right this dude coming in, but you know, this was a non-binary [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=902.78s)]
*  This dude had his hands off [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=911.62s)]
*  Like [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=913.62s)]
*  But he did have his pants off [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=920.62s)]
*  Well, he had I'll say this bro [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=922.42s)]
*  He was short and he it looked like he had a little bit of dick hanging out the bottom of his shirt [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=924.34s)]
*  Oh, that is oh, that's a weapon too [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=928.7s)]
*  It could be a weapon especially if you know what gender you are. Yeah, you don't know how that thing's gonna end up in you [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=932.18s)]
*  Would you be more scared of a guy with a gun or a guy naked guys kind of? [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=937.58s)]
*  You don't know what to do with a naked guy easy. Oh if I had to I'd get the bullets out of him [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=942.58s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? Yeah [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=947.02s)]
*  Handling down to keep the pressure out of them if I had to [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=949.14s)]
*  You ever see those videos where like that like those prank shows in the hood where the guys [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=952.1s)]
*  Talk shit to like tough dudes in the hood and the guys like what and he's about to and then they just strip naked [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=956.86s)]
*  And the guy runs [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=961.5s)]
*  Cuz I guess it's so jarring you don't know what to do when somebody's missing a piece of their [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=964.38s)]
*  Outfit it's just kind of a weird thing. I guess shirt off is more socially [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=970.26s)]
*  Well shirt off we're gonna fight. Yeah sure. We're gonna fight pants off [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=974.74s)]
*  Are we we may I might fuck you so that gets a little you meant that's probably what makes you nervous [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=978.22s)]
*  It's a novelty of it. No frame of reference like when the Indians first saw the boats [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=983.02s)]
*  They couldn't tell what they were really [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=986.6s)]
*  Yeah, they said he didn't they had no frame of reference for the conquistador boat [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=989.02s)]
*  So they just couldn't almost see them. They couldn't see them. They couldn't understand it [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=992.9s)]
*  Was like an object they'd never seen so if you get into a situation when a guy with no pants and he's threatening you [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=996.66s)]
*  You might not even understand it and just free maybe put maybe that's why she put her hands up [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=1001.3s)]
*  Yeah, maybe she didn't know she was like is this what you're supposed to do [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=1005.26s)]
*  Yeah, when a guy's has no pants on a little bit of dick hanging out under the shirt [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=1008.5s)]
*  He had a short shirt on too. He was a black guy too, which is unusual [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=1012.1s)]
*  Yeah, cuz usually they got long shirts off you go to black barbecue. They were down to their knees. Oh, yeah [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=1017.54s)]
*  Black guys like long shirts. Yeah, but guys look good and stuff. They were good in everything anything [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=1022.5s)]
*  Yeah, you know black guys look good in a black [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=1028.1s)]
*  I could walk around literally just with with shopping tags hang that's why I think a lot of black guys keep the tags on things [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=1031.7s)]
*  Cuz I think other people literally come up and shop off of them. Yeah, you know [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=1037.54s)]
*  Yeah, I like Dan. Let me scan this up right now, bro. That's not a bad idea, bro [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=1043.02s)]
*  You got a percentage of the sale it's like Dan let me scan two of those off of my boy [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=1048.26s)]
*  Yeah, he makes a little bit of bread. Yeah [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=1052.78s)]
*  I had a black friend who used to wear his hat like that with the stickers and tags and we're having a conversation [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=1054.78s)]
*  Once and he was like, you know, it's cops got to stop profiling me [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=1059.86s)]
*  I'm like, well, maybe if it looks if you make it look a little less like you just stole the hat out of the store [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=1062.96s)]
*  You're wearing it like you just ran out past the sensors. I mean, maybe that'll help [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=1068.66s)]
*  Yeah, they had a blanket. I saw with this is a chain made out of sensors [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=1073.98s)]
*  But that's not gonna that's not helpful. That's actually a good move [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=1077.78s)]
*  If you want to steal the store if you come in with the sensors on and they're going off you're going now [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=1082.66s)]
*  That's just my necklace. Yeah, don't look through my but don't don't profile me. That's my necklace going off. These are sensors [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=1087.94s)]
*  Yeah, pretty cool. I think I think if someone was cool enough, they could make sensors cool [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=1094.18s)]
*  Yeah, like you know like cuz fashion gets pretty ridiculous [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=1099.74s)]
*  Like if you look back in like the 1700s guys were wearing other dudes fucking hair and stockings and candy corn shoes [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=1103.26s)]
*  So that and that just objectively looks ridiculous [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=1111.1s)]
*  But that means at some point there was some dude who was so cool [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=1114.1399999999999s)]
*  Who was wearing it that everyone was like I want to be like him [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=1117.6599999999999s)]
*  so they started wearing fucking ridiculous stockings candy corn shoes and [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=1120.5s)]
*  Somebody else's hair was just some real serial killer shit. That's and then the whole continent of Europe started doing it [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=1124.7s)]
*  So if there was a cool enough dude who started wearing sensors and gave it value like Bitcoin which we all buy which we know is [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=1130.38s)]
*  Stupid then I think people would follow it depends on how fucking cool the person is wearing it. Mm-hmm [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=1136.5600000000002s)]

*  You're coming up with some theories that I haven't thought about you so you're saying you were saying without saying [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=1735.32s)]
*  Correct me if I'm wrong. Yeah, you're saying without saying black dudes got big dicks [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=1740.48s)]
*  Cuz black girls got big asses and to be able to reach the vagina they have to so it kind of evolved that way [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=1745.12s)]
*  I think so. I mean it makes sense [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=1751.48s)]
*  Yeah, I mean when I think about a lot of times if I think about having sex with a black girl, it's like [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=1754.3200000000002s)]
*  What I mean all this certainly depends but it's like I couldn't do it. You got your dick has to wear lifts [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=1758.88s)]

*  and Chinese Asian mm-hmm no, buts no, buts and also [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=1781.44s)]
*  Corresponding correlated. Yeah hypothetically hypothetically, but we all know it's true littler penises. Yeah, holy shit. Maybe [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=1787.52s)]
*  Because yeah, I mean it's like about nature like a hummingbird [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=1795.56s)]
*  Has to have that beat because it has to be able to um, I missed it that and you know what I'm saying [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=1799.64s)]
*  But it's not right. I [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=1805.8400000000001s)]

*  It gets in a certain type of flowers and it's like the deep ones [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=1815.76s)]
*  You know moment when you realize you didn't know that much about hummingbirds. I [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=1818.32s)]
*  Think it's the moment. I realized I didn't know that much [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=1822.24s)]

*  Okay, so you got started in New York, I just want to I know a lot of people know you but I want to make sure [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=1832.52s)]

*  Seven months I took off. I just felt like I wasn't maybe I didn't know what I was doing [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=1938.0800000000002s)]
*  Was there a reason that you took some time off or was it? Yeah, so I I got shot early on I started [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=1943.1200000000001s)]
*  Doing comedy in [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=1949.88s)]
*  2000 I got shot in 2001 by gun by gun. Yeah way. Yeah. Yeah Wow, and what did it feel like it burns? [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=1951.68s)]
*  It's hot [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=1959.44s)]
*  Just hot. Yeah, think about that. Yeah, it's hot [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=1960.64s)]
*  you don't you know your body takes care you like chemicals or whatever that is for the pain and like [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=1963.1200000000001s)]
*  Your body releases shit that kind of but like DMT daddy. Yeah, it's DMT [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=1968.8400000000001s)]
*  I guess but then afterwards when all that adrenaline adrenaline and also adrenaline when that adrenaline dies down is just heat [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=1972.9s)]
*  You can actually see smoke coming out of the hole like a little bit of smoke. Yeah [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=1979.88s)]
*  Yeah, and so that was fine. I went night in the hospital [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=1983.72s)]
*  I got shot like close to you know, my dick and ass did you really yeah like right here? [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=1987.88s)]
*  Yeah, and you can see smoke coming out so for a second [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=1992.7600000000002s)]
*  Yeah, you can see a little smoke coming out when they cut my plastic pants off of me jogging pants [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=1996.0s)]
*  Whatever you call them like your femur is fucking vaping in there. Yeah [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=1999.68s)]
*  look like and [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2003.3600000000001s)]
*  And then you feel the heat and then a little sting when all the chemical when all the whatever adrenaline rushes comes down [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2005.52s)]
*  I just got lucky it didn't hit an artery or anything like that [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2011.8799999999999s)]
*  but you know the that wasn't the problem was was the panic attacks that started afterwards like sort of the PTSD that I [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2014.3999999999999s)]
*  Didn't know what it was [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2022.0s)]
*  And so I started having like these panic attacks and I it was related to the trauma from that like just walking around being scared [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2023.02s)]
*  Like oh shit that happened to me could happen any moment and I didn't know what it was [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2028.3999999999999s)]
*  So I just doubt with it for why I didn't know what trauma was or what was going on [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2031.4599999999998s)]
*  I would just get on a train in New York and I would just start bugging out and like hyperventilating [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2034.64s)]
*  Wow, and then not knowing why is like my subconscious [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2038.6000000000001s)]
*  So I'm going what the fuck is going on and I just lived like that for a while [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2042.2800000000002s)]
*  And so I quit comedy because I get up on stage and I'd have these massive panic attacks [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2045.5200000000002s)]

*  Figuring out that that was it. It was uh, sitting with a therapist being she was a female therapist [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2202.26s)]
*  I was attracted to her. Mmm. So did you tell her that I didn't tell her that which felt like I wasn't being [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2208.7000000000003s)]

*  but because of that I was just more I [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2220.6200000000003s)]
*  Don't know. I was more vulnerable open like guys [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2224.06s)]
*  You're always a little standoffish when you sit with a guy like fuck your guy [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2226.6600000000003s)]
*  I don't I got it. I can't be vulnerable around a guy [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2229.94s)]
*  I always got to be a guy but a woman you just kind of you can act a little more like a woman [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2232.9s)]
*  And talk about your feelings, right? So I was able to something about her [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2236.6600000000003s)]

*  And I got over the fact that I wanted to sleep with her. Maybe it's because of the connection, you know, we're comics [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2245.3s)]
*  We're all fucked up. We got walls up [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2250.7000000000003s)]
*  There's reasons why we stand on wood planks for chicken fingers for ten years to have strangers give us a [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2252.2200000000003s)]
*  Huh, you know, it's cuz we didn't get something else. So there's walls up but she was able to take those down [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2259.02s)]
*  She was beautiful too. God her legs was the problem. Oh if she wore pants more [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2264.14s)]
*  May but maybe that's what opened me up. I was always distracted with her legs. Oh, yeah. Yeah, they were just nice [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2269.42s)]
*  Oh, I noticed I'll be involved in anything [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2275.34s)]
*  Do not hear a set of high heels in the distance and I have no control over my ability to zone out of whatever [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2277.98s)]
*  Is going on so the sound of high heels yeah, and it's not even about sex. It's just the idea [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2284.7400000000002s)]
*  That a woman could be around, you know, I think when I was young I didn't get that care [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2292.1800000000003s)]
*  And so it was like this simple idea that a woman could be coming around to give me some type of care affection [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2296.94s)]
*  Oh, like it's like there's a part of me that just cannot help but [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2302.6200000000003s)]
*  Go and listen for that listen to that. I read it the wrong way [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2308.0600000000004s)]
*  I like I was reading it like a like a predator hearing prey like, you know [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2311.58s)]
*  Oh, no, like a coyote hearing like movement in the brush. Oh, no. No you were yours was more of like a [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2316.04s)]
*  Trinket you need it. Yeah. Yeah, I think that's where that kind of yeah with chicks it for me is that's the first part [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2322.7s)]
*  I'd you like to suck tit. Did you were you breastfed? [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2328.04s)]
*  by a small breast so you do you like when you get a big one, do you just oh [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2331.62s)]
*  I definitely I [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2337.94s)]
*  Have I've overstayed my welcome. Yeah on a big tit [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2340.58s)]
*  This is like the second and third time already in this podcast [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2343.98s)]
*  You've said something without saying something and I picked up on it [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2346.7000000000003s)]
*  The first one was but now I know you were basically saying your mom had small breasts. Oh, my mom knows it [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2349.54s)]
*  Yeah, is if she the one who breastfed was your mom who breastfed you I [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2354.26s)]
*  Sometimes another woman will get in there and oh yeah African villages. Yeah [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2358.3s)]
*  Sisters aunts my sister's cousin-in-law bread. They would breastfeed each other's children the um, but I believe that my mother did it [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2362.42s)]
*  As far as I know right, but yeah small breasts you never shake the trauma from [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2369.98s)]
*  Breastfeeding out of a small breast you never the fucking just the rattle just trying to rattle a drop of milk out of something [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2376.02s)]
*  So small it's insane. It's insane that we let a child do it [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2383.02s)]
*  What's insane when you sit think about right now a kid? I'm like a lowercase a cup [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2386.98s)]
*  I just imagine you not being able to find anything you're trying to grab you just rat [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2392.2200000000003s)]
*  Hitting the bag you just you know, and there's nothing in there like a wall climber looking for somewhere to put your fingers [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2397.34s)]
*  And there's just nothing it's just a flat wall [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2403.7400000000002s)]
*  It's nice traumatic it's definitely exactly you said it's traumatic crazy that you remember that too, even though there was no video evidence [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2409.46s)]
*  Well, I do believe that when I start to I can feel the desperation of it and the why isn't there something there? [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2416.02s)]
*  So you remember the feeling not necessarily the facts well, I think I always have that feeling right something I'm missing something something isn't available [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2423.3s)]
*  right something isn't [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2432.02s)]
*  Complete right so I just take it back to usually things like that probably and not specifically breastfeeding [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2434.7400000000002s)]
*  But just the feminine connect me to a you know connecting a feminine a feminine across the board [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2440.5s)]
*  Yeah, you know, but [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2447.6200000000003s)]
*  Do you want things to be complete like oh I'm being alive is kind of incomplete [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2450.5s)]
*  We're only complete when we die and we you know [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2456.14s)]
*  God willing we go out we go to the party, you know, yeah [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2458.94s)]
*  Yeah, I just think of your foundation as a you know [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2462.8199999999997s)]
*  If you got all the stair steps and you can get onto the porch, you know [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2465.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it's always feel like we fucking just had a pile of wood right there [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2468.22s)]
*  nails [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2472.7s)]
*  Like no plan that analogy was very like that was like your background and you're like you saw a porch you went to stairs [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2474.1s)]
*  I would have gone like elevator push the button. Oh, wow. Yeah, were you guys pretty well off growing up? We were okay [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2481.02s)]
*  We were okay. Yeah, I was my friends had less money. My parents were both lawyers. Oh, wow, really? [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2487.42s)]
*  Yeah, but they made like a hundred thousand dollars, which back then was like a lot of money still a lot still a lot [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2493.1s)]
*  I guess it's still but back then I guess it was a lot. Oh, yeah [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2499.54s)]
*  Yeah, yeah hundred thousand back then man. That was as almost as much as you could have it seemed like I don't even think it was [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2502.74s)]
*  Possible to have more than a hundred thousand right somebody had a hundred thousand dollars [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2507.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I don't you never heard of anyone if someone had more than a hundred thousand dollars back then they hid it [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2511.9399999999996s)]
*  They did not talk about it. They were yeah, they were they were doing something real illegal [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2516.7s)]
*  Yeah, I felt the only way to get more than a hundred thousand was illegal. I felt like back then [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2520.74s)]
*  There was like a cap back then it seemed like it. Yeah, you know, um [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2526.14s)]
*  So we were we were okay, we were pretty well off like I went to private school [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2530.78s)]
*  Oh, so they had a house send me to private school. Yeah, but back then private school was like, you know [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2534.54s)]
*  Ten grand a year fifteen grand a year something like that. It wasn't like now which is like [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2538.78s)]
*  It's a lot. You got a re you have to have a lot more than a hundred thousand dollars to go to private school now [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2543.02s)]
*  But all my friends went to public school so they would just they would always yeah [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2549.86s)]
*  They would always steal money out of my dad's pocket when he left his pants up on the and do Greeks [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2554.18s)]
*  Yeah, do Greeks carry a lot? I feel like Greeks carry like a lot of cash on them [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2559.1s)]
*  Oh his cash really people very very paranoid defensive people. Yeah, they're we were formally enslaved by the Turks [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2563.18s)]
*  I think all people who are like, you know [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2570.78s)]
*  I think the Irish have a little because the English fucked them it is heartbreaking right like long [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2574.06s)]
*  You think about it? Yeah, because then all that trauma gets stuck in people then it's coming out in crazy ways [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2578.78s)]
*  You know, it's coming out and some guy fucking, you know beating somebody's face in with a hard euro over here [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2583.34s)]
*  You know [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2589.38s)]
*  Common crime in the Greek community. It never yeah [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2590.58s)]
*  That's where the air damage we're talking about [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2594.34s)]
*  Okay, so now you've been in New York for a long time you done comedy over the years you got shot you took a break [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2600.38s)]
*  Who shot you do you know? I do know who shot me. Yeah. Well, I know I don't know him [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2605.68s)]
*  He's not like I didn't know him personally, but we had to go to trial and everything. He pled not guilty [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2610.22s)]
*  Oh, yeah, so I had to sit there and [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2615.0s)]
*  Testify and [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2617.92s)]
*  Yeah, it was just it was an attempted robbery because I was with the friend I was with was a promoter [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2619.56s)]
*  So he carried a lot of cash with him [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2625.6s)]
*  So I assume it was an attempted robbery or carjacking or both, you know [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2627.72s)]
*  And I was just wrong place wrong time and I made the I maybe the wrong decision or right [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2632.26s)]
*  I mean in that moment, you know, you're either like free [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2638.26s)]
*  Like I just grabbed his arm and tried to get it away and fired and I just point-blank range [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2641.4s)]
*  I got shot. Maybe it would have been worse if he was farther away [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2647.04s)]
*  So the bullet had a little chance to I don't know how fat I don't know which bullet goes faster [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2649.88s)]
*  I'm not I'm not a ballistics expert like if a bullet picks up steam or lose it pick up steam [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2655.0s)]
*  I guess there's certain point it would pick up steam right certain distance [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2659.84s)]
*  There must be an apex if you're certain a certain distance away where it's the fastest where it could do the most damage [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2663.0s)]
*  I don't know [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2669.32s)]
*  Thank God was a little fatter than because it got caught in my butt cheek [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2670.88s)]
*  And the bullet stayed in there is it still in there now I took it out a couple years later [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2674.96s)]
*  that was a wild moment when they took it out because [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2679.2400000000002s)]
*  They put you under and [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2683.72s)]
*  the way I came to [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2686.04s)]
*  And they had me up in stirrups [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2687.92s)]
*  Like I was at a gynecologist because they the surgery happened right here [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2689.52s)]
*  So I came to like this with my legs up and I came to when I farted [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2692.76s)]
*  And I farted with the doctor and the nurse down there and they were like laughing because I farted it [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2697.68s)]
*  But like I didn't know where I was and I had to pass gas and then they took it out [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2703.08s)]
*  And that's that's that's all I remember about that surgery and that put an end to that trauma [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2707.84s)]
*  Really right when the bullet came out. Do you feel like it was that but just having the bullet in you still like yeah [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2712.92s)]
*  It was in there. It like I totally yeah, the spirit of it was in there [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2716.96s)]
*  Yeah, the spirit of it was like an invasion like the bullet was like [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2720.68s)]
*  You know, it was it was in my it wasn't paying rent [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2725.0s)]
*  Yeah, part of my body all the rest of my organs pay rent. Yeah, and there was this thing and it was just freeloading [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2727.7999999999997s)]
*  Hey, and I was like, I gotta get this freeloader. So finally [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=2732.64s)]

*  I mean anybody that's grilling room a fish in their room on a little grill like that at night trying and he was trying [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=3435.7799999999997s)]
*  To secretly do it [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=3442.18s)]
*  Cuz one of the rules was you couldn't cook in your room because a lot of people are drug users in there [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=3442.94s)]
*  Ah, so one dude's cooking a fish one dude's cooking up a batch of whatever, you know some fireball for his arm [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=3447.26s)]

*  So it wasn't the fish that was shady. It was the whole [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=3456.62s)]
*  Situation what was going on that way he was more the shady it was breaking the rules. Okay, so the fish was just a fish [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=3460.02s)]
*  Yeah, all right [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=3465.2200000000003s)]

*  He couldn't have gum so he was like breaking it was like I had some kind of candy or something [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=3470.94s)]
*  He kept one. Oh, it was nerd ropes [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=3475.1800000000003s)]
*  So this dude fucking kept every time I get my nerd ropes open [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=3477.58s)]
*  He could hear the bag from the distance row from across the desert, dude [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=3481.54s)]
*  Like we with high heels and you oh [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=3485.3s)]

*  Have you ever like this is what I like what in my background in New York [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=3497.3399999999997s)]
*  There's a lot of like Irish Catholic girls like Catholic Puerto Ricans Catholic was a big religion. It's very repressive [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=3502.74s)]
*  Sexually, I almost felt like when you hooked up with one of those girls [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=3509.4599999999996s)]
*  That the repression was worth it for their energy they were so [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=3514.66s)]
*  Happy like a religious dude with nerd rope or whatever little thing he can get that's not allowed [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=3520.02s)]
*  It's almost worth it like sexually. It's almost worth it for us all to be repressed to give it a little something extra. Oh [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=3526.22s)]
*  I think that's what some of the value in the having the repression in religion for sex is yeah [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=3534.22s)]
*  It's like to keep some energy in it to keep some fuel in the tank. Yeah, and yeah [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=3540.84s)]
*  There's definitely been a gal when she gets a hold of your [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=3545.7799999999997s)]
*  Nerd rope if you will even which is still I didn't think about that a great term for a wiener. It is a really good [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=3548.62s)]
*  Yeah, they're definitely more keyed up about it [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=3554.48s)]
*  Like there's some girls that'll damn floss their teeth with it, you know, let them because it's just like so forbidden [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=3557.48s)]
*  Yeah, just that forbidden, you know, it's a real dessert. Yeah, but if you just say all day [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=3563.96s)]
*  You're just over there with your legs open at the bakery. Then you definitely becomes tried it becomes there's no value in it [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=3568.42s)]
*  Yeah, it's kind of a lot of our society. We burnt out a lot of the value of things [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=3574.64s)]
*  I think that's where we're at right now. Me too. We're almost like freedoms gotten too free [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=3579.24s)]
*  Well pornography is burned down like any like a lot of sexual energy [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=3583.62s)]
*  So I think you have a lot of marriages that probably are I wonder if you could calculate how much pornography has killed marriages [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=3588.14s)]
*  It's probably killed a lot not even marriage is just sex drive and like imagination [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=3594.2s)]
*  You know like it's bad pornography is bad and like it's bad cuz there's no smells in it [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=3601.3999999999996s)]
*  There's no people's feelings in it. You're just something got to be very unnatural about just staring at a modern screen [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=3607.58s)]
*  Moving pictures of something else that you can't smell. It's just like visual and you're it's got to be something bad for your brain there [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=3615.38s)]
*  Oh, dude, I remember biking across town. I'd bike over there [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=3623.1s)]

*  I'd just be in there playing with myself [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=3644.58s)]
*  I would come over there weekends and be all sweaty [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=3650.58s)]
*  Go in there just use it a can for a while [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=3654.58s)]
*  Touch myself and then drink a bunch of water take a nap and then bike back home hydrate you have to hide [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=3658.12s)]
*  You can you think I must you that means you had a vigorous [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=3663.44s)]

*  Yeah, yeah the the mags because I'm from that generation to God the man [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=3679.58s)]
*  So I used to put them out like that I used to put them out [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=3685.96s)]
*  Yeah [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=3689.2400000000002s)]
*  And then like we would we would share them one person will be one friend would be done with them [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=3689.4s)]
*  Pass them off to you and there'd be a circle [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=3692.86s)]
*  I would put the mags out like that like four of them and make my own moving picture just by looking at all [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=3694.98s)]
*  Oh, it's real fast. Yeah, just real fast [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=3700.6800000000003s)]
*  I would go like counter clockwise too and I would just try you know, yeah [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=3702.48s)]
*  So I was kind of ahead of the game when it like, you know, oh, yeah. Yeah a little bit [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=3706.52s)]
*  I was making it. Yeah, I did my I used my imagination in some way to make this situation a little more valuable [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=3711.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's hard to just look at a Calvin Klein ad and just [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=3718.36s)]
*  It's tough Kate Moss only last, you know, it's just like [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=3722.16s)]

*  I need her to be adopted like I that's what I need. Yeah in order for me to feel something [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=3735.52s)]
*  I need her to have some real big issue that I'm trying to solve that'll never be solved that I can chase [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=3739.88s)]
*  mmm, like um [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=3745.2000000000003s)]
*  adoption is a good one adopted women are [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=3746.48s)]
*  Like a Nicolas Cage movie almost that's a hole you can never fill the rejection from the mother [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=3749.32s)]
*  So is amber heard adopted? I was like if she would not be surprised she was adopted. She has that vibe to her [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=3754.52s)]
*  She's a victim [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=3761.12s)]
*  Let's look it up I'm taking it I'm taking a guess [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=3763.76s)]
*  Because adopted adopted people just that the rejection from the mom is just [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=3767.04s)]
*  on that level, you know, a lot of us don't get the nurture and all that but like [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=3773.08s)]
*  To just say he I don't want it. That's something you can't fill [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=3777.2799999999997s)]

*  Amber heard [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=3786.2799999999997s)]
*  Can't see those are you find her attractive and we're going to bring it in here [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=3790.04s)]

*  As well yeah, but that the cause wasn't right. Yeah. Yeah, I think the whole thing was kind of discombobulated [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4148.8s)]
*  It was definitely discombobulated. Yeah, that was [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4155.84s)]

*  Like Joel Osteen if he got in power at [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4205.84s)]
*  Talk, I mean, he's got him. I was just thinking I didn't even he's got a mullet kind of right [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4209.320000000001s)]

*  So it's comfortable you you're comfortable with it. It's a full commitment. You're married at that point [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4233.08s)]
*  You're in a relationship with your hair. Yeah, once you sat there for an hour together. He's just dating his hair right now [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4237.86s)]
*  Yeah, he's still it's still like yeah. Yeah, it's still in the dating phase. Yeah, what would a civil war be about? [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4243.04s)]
*  It would probably be about abortion [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4249.28s)]
*  Abortion would be one of them [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4252.44s)]
*  Bathrooms people really upset about bathrooms [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4256.08s)]

*  Yeah, and it's ironic because the construction workers most of the time believe in less bathrooms [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4265.72s)]
*  But it would be good for their business to build more [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4271.0s)]
*  You know, I mean, that's a great point even think about that. Yeah, and I always wanted to I always wanted to know if there should [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4275.32s)]
*  Be like I don't like the should there be gay and straight bathrooms [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4279.92s)]
*  Gay and straight as well. Well, because if I'm a gay dude [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4286.12s)]
*  Yeah, and I get to roll into a place where other dudes it has their penises out. Yeah [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4289.96s)]
*  It's like a fat dude walking into a barbecue [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4297.12s)]
*  But that's okay, right well, I I'm not saying it's anything wrong with no, but I understand what you're questioning like, you know [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4301.72s)]
*  Is that or if there's a should there be hey, I'm a pedophile [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4308.16s)]
*  Do can I just go pee by myself somewhere to keep me on whatever path? [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4312.28s)]
*  I'm you know to keep me away from you know what I'm saying. Like how often do you separate it? [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4316.72s)]
*  Yeah, I know exactly these are really difficult problems to solve because what if you know, you're a pedophile, right? [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4321.32s)]
*  You know it pedophile and you don't want to go in there [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4327.32s)]
*  Yeah, you don't want to go in there cuz it's just pediophiles are very hydrating better very hydrated pedophile because you mix Pedialyte and [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4330.16s)]
*  And pedophile. Let me just turn that's that's me on your phone. Yeah, it's turned off. Yeah [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4338.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah, because I don't know cuz it's just like we keep separating everything we keep separating everything, you know [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4348.08s)]
*  Well, we you kind of have to that's the problem like to govern this whole thing that's the problem with freedom [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4353.54s)]
*  it's like the oxymoronic thing about freedom is [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4359.86s)]
*  You know, I need to be okay with you doing something different and and you need to be okay with me doing something different [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4363.58s)]
*  But by virtue the fact that we're okay with us doing something different because we're free [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4369.82s)]
*  We don't want to hang out with each other [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4372.9400000000005s)]
*  So we separate and then somehow you got to be like world [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4374.38s)]
*  It's got to be like a detente like hey, man, you're going to that club. We're going to this club you believe in that [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4376.9800000000005s)]
*  I believe in that obviously we're not gonna hang out because we believe different things [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4381.1s)]
*  But that's gonna create separation and eventually cause a problem. Yeah that threatens freedom [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4384.54s)]
*  So it's kind of like this built-in oxymoronic tenant to fucking what freedom is [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4390.1s)]
*  It's like built to fail and that's why authoritarians always come in and just make everything the same [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4394.9800000000005s)]
*  You know, and then you're like fuck that was inevitable and then that gets stale because you know [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4401.1s)]
*  You need you need Jewish people to complain in order for things to get better [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4407.06s)]
*  Yeah, you know like if Hitler got what he wanted they wouldn't nothing would get better because nobody around to be like [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4411.06s)]
*  I had this place is a little too small. It's a little too hot [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4417.1s)]
*  We need to change this the foods a little cold and then they nobody knows what's good or not [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4419.200000000001s)]
*  But then that never ends though. Yeah, you got to curtail it back [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4423.54s)]
*  I think at some point you got to Christian it back a little [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4427.160000000001s)]
*  Because then it's like if you get so far down that this is wrong [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4429.780000000001s)]
*  This is then you're just at the point where it's like the freedom thing. It's like when is this ever right? [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4433.740000000001s)]
*  It's like too negative too negative too negative, right? Well, it's like we're never [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4438.34s)]
*  There's always gonna be a problem, right? Right like at some point you can't always have a problem, right? [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4442.62s)]
*  At some point things have got to be like this is good enough, right? [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4448.62s)]
*  Because then that's that that fosters greed cuz you're like it's not gonna this is bad. This is bad [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4451.46s)]
*  Maybe this will fix it. This will fix it. There's a problem every way you like the problem every look at everything [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4456.3s)]
*  It's tough. The only way to have be okay is for us to just fucking die [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4461.34s)]
*  Do you think I've thought about this sometimes like do you think that humans are supposed to be here? [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4466.62s)]
*  When you look at the rest of nature, it's really interesting. It's like [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4473.5s)]
*  You know, it's really [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4478.0599999999995s)]

*  Didn't know I didn't know she'd taken a nap or she was just so old or something [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4563.68s)]
*  You know that caused any trauma for you while you're getting a haircut. Are you like do you keep asking? Are you okay? I? [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4566.84s)]
*  Ended up cutting my own hair at some point in my life for like probably 17 15 17 years. Yeah, but um [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4572.8s)]
*  So we're walking in the place. Okay, you're hungry. I'll say you're hungry. I want to fuck. All right, right [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4579.24s)]
*  So since we're walking we're inhabiting the same reality, but you're you're driven by a desire to eat [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4584.56s)]
*  I'm driven by a desire to fuck so you're gonna notice all the food places. I'm gonna notice all the whores [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4591.12s)]
*  Okay, so our realities are different. So [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4597.52s)]
*  Our desires and our perceptions I think create what reality is as much as what it actually is [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4600.84s)]
*  We're walking through the same place, right? [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4608.16s)]
*  But we're noticing different things so the reality is different for both of us [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4610.2s)]
*  Even though there's this blank slate of what it is [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4614.04s)]
*  So it's sort of that thing does a does a does a tree make a sound in the forest if nobody's there to hear it? [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4616.5s)]
*  yes, and no [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4623.4s)]
*  because you need the [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4625.16s)]
*  Faculty of sound to be able to hear it so without humans at all [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4628.2s)]
*  It doesn't make a sound but the only way the reason why sound is a phenomenon is because we have ears [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4633.32s)]
*  So we wouldn't even be asking a question if there was no people here [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4641.48s)]
*  Mmm, so you need both for even the question to be asked. So we're part of this work. Like look you built this whole shit [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4644.459999999999s)]
*  This is your imagination. Like this is like this is just this is just a manifestation of ideas [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4651.639999999999s)]
*  This is part of reality now, but this was in you you were like, I like this picture here [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4657.320000000001s)]
*  I want that thing there. I want smart waters for my guests. This is this but this is all this is Theo like manifested [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4661.56s)]
*  So like you've this is reality, right? [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4668.88s)]
*  But this is you've made it and this is like you've you've built it you built reality [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4671.64s)]
*  You know reality wasn't here without you [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4677.200000000001s)]
*  It's like, you know, so it's it's a little bit of a symbiotic relationship happening at the same time [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4679.6s)]
*  So we kind of like build reality while we're going like a dark tunnel with nothing [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4684.78s)]
*  What do you think that we've be sometimes? I wonder if years from now we'll look back and be like holy shit [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4689.8s)]
*  We went down a crazy uncomfortable [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4694.0s)]
*  Path of the reality we built, you know and like well we look back and like oh man that whole path [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4696.3s)]
*  They took was wrong and this is the correct way to go [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4702.7s)]
*  like I just feel like sometimes we've gotten so far from like nature and things that really like [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4705.8s)]
*  Intrinsically like make us feel good maybe that we're so far from those receptors even [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4710.88s)]
*  That it's getting like kind of not dour because life is you know, there's a lot of great moments [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4716.04s)]
*  but overall is it is [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4721.660000000001s)]
*  And I what it could just be American society doing well, you know, I don't know comfort corrupts eventually it feels like that a little bit [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4725.76s)]
*  It does maybe you're right [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4733.160000000001s)]
*  maybe like we would feel more fulfilled if we were still hunting and [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4734.6s)]
*  Women still had hair on their vaginas and stuff like that [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4738.240000000001s)]
*  There was a little more unpleasant trees [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4740.6s)]
*  We were used to because when you make things pleasant pleasant pleasant, then you want more pleasant more pleasant. Yeah [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4742.5s)]
*  Oh, there's no hair to choke on water meeting her pussy [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4748.06s)]
*  But now I want her pussy tastes like honeydew and you just keep going and keep going [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4749.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so like you actually start putting syrup in there. Yeah, which is where we're at, which is where we're at [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4753.4400000000005s)]
*  Like if there's no if it doesn't taste like syrup then we're a little dissatisfied. Yeah, I mean people are selling frickin, you know [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4758.92s)]
*  Condiments and stuff like that for the body and the crotch. Yeah [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4765.1s)]
*  What else man we had some good news topics that came up what happened what's happening in the news guys [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4769.900000000001s)]
*  Let me see. What do we have here? [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4775.14s)]
*  Is that you as Abraham Lincoln? I [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4778.18s)]
*  Guess it is. Yeah [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4780.9800000000005s)]
*  Someone made that that's really a nice thing. Somebody drew with all the different faces on it [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4782.780000000001s)]
*  That's very cool all the podcasting for everything fell apart. Yeah [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4787.860000000001s)]
*  As it used to be a real scene right now, it's like it still is it's just like more individual scenes, you know [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4793.1s)]
*  Yeah, do you feel that because you guys were doing it? [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4799.5s)]
*  Well, you guys did you first you guys had history history hyenas, right? [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4801.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah, me and Chris and what happened was there a reason you guys took it off. He just run its course [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4805.06s)]
*  Yeah kind of ran its course. He wanted to do different things and you know, I want to do different things and you know [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4809.76s)]
*  We ended it kind of on a high note. I guess like, you know [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4816.54s)]
*  I know there's a lot of speculation about it and all this but you know, is there yeah a lot of speculation [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4819.14s)]
*  But in retrospect when you look back, you're like, yeah [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4824.26s)]
*  I'm kind of we're probably both glad it ended when it did and that fan should be happy it ended when it did [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4826.86s)]
*  You know, it got a real cult following people really into it me and Chris had a real rhythm that we built and [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4831.9s)]
*  It was this two-man comedy, which I love man. It's like I love that. Yeah, I love that [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4838.1s)]
*  I just love feeling it, you know [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4843.14s)]
*  It's like me and you would be real good friends because it's not totally smooth, but there's moments were smooth [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4844.84s)]
*  But if we spent a lot of time together, it would get really smooth. Oh, wow, it's real [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4850.0s)]
*  I mean the bumpy moments are kind of real, right? [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4854.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's how I kind of like like my wife because I usually I'd like if I was seduced by a girl [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4856.68s)]
*  I bet I'd fall in love with her and then it would turn to shit and I'm like, that's not the right way to go and [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4862.08s)]
*  Then the people who I want to be around it's always a little bit [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4866.360000000001s)]
*  There's work because anything that's real takes work. Yeah, so like my wife I didn't have a great time the first time [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4868.92s)]
*  She bored the hell out of me. I hope she doesn't watch this podcast. Really? Yeah, she bored the hell out of me [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4874.2s)]
*  She just sat there fucking silent and I remember my friend who unfortunately is going through a rough time right now [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4878.2s)]
*  But he told me I was complaining about I was like she doesn't talk she doesn't say anything [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4883.44s)]
*  He's been married for a long time and he was going he was going he was going like that [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4887.36s)]
*  So you're complaining about that and then that changed my perspective which changed my reality [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4891.76s)]
*  I was like, oh shit [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4896.72s)]
*  Maybe that is a good thing long term that she's kind of chill comfortable in her own skin [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4898.04s)]
*  Doesn't need to talk all the time [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4902.28s)]
*  People need to talk all the time are usually covering up for the fact that they're they feel insecure [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4904.48s)]
*  They're bored and I changed my whole fucking outlook on it Wow [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4908.48s)]
*  And then you end up marrying her and I ended up marrying her so it's like I loved I loved the two-man [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4911.32s)]
*  I love like I had a character and I had a my friend who passed right away [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4915.42s)]
*  Angelo we did this live show and this we did this two-man comedy man like Angela Bowers [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4919.16s)]
*  No, Angelo, Lazada, New York comic and he passed away and [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4924.32s)]
*  It was just there's something magical about when you're connecting with someone on a comedic vibe and the two you don't where it's going [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4929.68s)]
*  Yeah, create something bigger than yourself anytime. You're creating something bigger than yourself is a beautiful thing [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4936.32s)]
*  I think a lot of times people get depressed or anxious because they're thinking about themselves too much because we're boring [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4942.76s)]
*  The thing is we may think we're great [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4947.88s)]
*  But we're all just kind of like shitty humans walking around shitting and pissing and having itchy balls and like we're dying [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4949.72s)]
*  Slowly with air air hardening is happening to us [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4956.24s)]
*  Isn't that wild that oxygen the same thing that keeps us alive is also slowly killing us. That's what happens [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4959.44s)]
*  Really just like a fruit. Damn fruit the air gives the fruit life [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4964.24s)]
*  But if you if you leave it too long that air actually kills the fruit it rots it. That's air exposure [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4967.72s)]
*  overexposure damn it's like Aaron Brockovich kind of it's [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4973.0s)]
*  It's exactly like Aaron Brockovich [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4976.64s)]
*  and um [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4978.68s)]
*  so I love that two-man thing and that's what me and Chris had and [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4979.68s)]
*  And maybe it just kind of reached its thing where it was like I we did it [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4983.24s)]
*  You know and like when you look back you're kind of like that comedy exists for the three years and then he's doing great stuff [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4986.280000000001s)]
*  I'm doing something different and was it scary to change that would be the part that's scary for me to scary part to change to [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4992.8s)]
*  Think like okay something else is gonna come along. That's gonna fill this space or I'm gonna this is gonna affect my creativity or it's gonna affect my [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=4999.16s)]
*  Livelihood even like my ticket sales or my people to be able to hear me did those kind of things come into your head? [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5007.6s)]
*  Cuz that's that comes into my head cuz I do another podcast [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5012.84s)]
*  You know I think about well if I didn't do this or or if I didn't do this or you know [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5015.68s)]
*  Now we're all our own businesses so much that it's like if I let go of one little segment of my business [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5020.0s)]
*  Is that gonna mess everything up? It gets scary. Yeah, I used to worry a lot more with that [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5025.96s)]
*  I didn't worry at all and even thinking about it when you were asking it is like I [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5031.64s)]
*  Don't I get I guess that means I matured a little bit because it's like maybe you believe in yourself a little more you just [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5035.599999999999s)]
*  Trust something's gonna happen you believe in your talents and also taking me accepting my own mortality [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5041.12s)]
*  Which was something that always scared me yeah? [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5048.44s)]
*  Helps because it takes the pressure off everything [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5051.76s)]
*  It's like if it's good, or it's not it doesn't matter like because it's ephemeral. It's going away anyway [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5055.2s)]
*  So might as well try to connect to people might as well try to have a good time [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5061.34s)]
*  Whether there's money involved or not as long as I'm having a good time the experience is the same like if me and you were [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5064.74s)]
*  Sitting here. This is a huge podcast right? [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5071.42s)]
*  If it was a small podcast what would be the difference in the feeling that me and you were having there'd be no difference [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5074.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, right be no difference between like what we're trying to do here trying to get to know each other [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5080.74s)]
*  Which is a you know challenge for like we're just meeting each other too [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5085.1s)]
*  It's filmed because why not monetize that in this era [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5088.94s)]
*  Sometimes my wife talks. I'm like don't speak unless you fucking we've got cameras wrong [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5093.62s)]
*  So the other day I invited a friend of that [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5098.66s)]
*  I don't know but I kind of a buddy out for lunch, and I was like fuck it feels insane inviting somebody out [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5101.72s)]
*  But not a podcast [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5106.96s)]
*  Because it gets so busy, but go on I interrupt yeah [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5109.58s)]
*  No, but I was just saying it's that takes the pressure off for me a lot that takes the pressure off when I think about that [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5112.26s)]
*  I put things into perspective and go like [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5117.02s)]
*  When you're talking about do I get scared like we're scared about like I was gonna hurt my ticket sales or my livelihood [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5120.02s)]
*  that fear always creeps in but then I realized like [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5125.22s)]
*  Even if it does [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5129.1s)]
*  You know I'm dying anyway, or even if it doesn't and I get money. I'm still dying anyway [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5131.1s)]
*  So hopefully I'm having a good time [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5136.620000000001s)]
*  Damn and the one thing I did those silver lining from having that moment when I got shot and that I can share and it is [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5138.620000000001s)]
*  Experience and a lot of people have that I did have yeah [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5145.719999999999s)]
*  We think you're gonna die in that moment you think it's over [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5147.9s)]
*  And I did not like the way I felt because you have this moment. It's like a dream where you [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5150.4s)]
*  It's hard to explain like you know like a dream. It's like how did that happen in two seconds? [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5156.88s)]
*  How did I have that whole story happen and then? [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5161.179999999999s)]
*  Scientists are saying like it only happens in a second your brain somehow does that thing where you get like this recap [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5163.759999999999s)]
*  where you look at yourself you have this feeling about who you are what you've done everything and [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5168.96s)]
*  I was like I didn't like it and so thankfully I was able to not die then [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5174.64s)]
*  But I also burdened with this knowledge of like fuck. I don't want to feel that again [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5179.48s)]
*  So like when I have that moment when I'm dying. I want to be chill [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5183.44s)]
*  I want to be able to be like I like who I am I like what I did [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5186.5599999999995s)]
*  I like the way I lived I was true to whatever it is [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5190.6s)]
*  I want to do or who I am and I tried at least or to be brave or to be me or [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5193.96s)]
*  Whatever it is was it felt important in that moment and like wow so I guess that's the silver lining of that moment [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5199.92s)]
*  It sucked other than that and like knowing like oh shit. That's what you live for you live for that moment [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5206.5599999999995s)]
*  You want that moment to be peaceful you want that moment because that moment is coming [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5211.5599999999995s)]
*  There's no way to avoid it for any of us so all this other shit comes and goes ups and downs [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5216.0599999999995s)]
*  But that shit is a certainty and you have that moment of awareness [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5220.78s)]
*  That's interesting are you able to recreate that moment in any other way in your life that you've noticed since then or the moment [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5224.72s)]
*  Where there are times you're like oh, this is a little bit of a recreation of that no wow no no there's so much going on [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5230.280000000001s)]
*  It's so weird that fucking moment man. It's a weird moment fuck. Where were you laying down? [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5237.56s)]
*  No, I was in the car [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5242.64s)]
*  You were sitting in the car sitting care dealing with him while it was happening and also that's why I'm saying [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5243.96s)]
*  It's so weird was also like having all these thoughts you know and like feelings about people [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5249.28s)]
*  I love bad things I've done you're bleeding. I'm bleeding. It's all happening. It happens in a second sound [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5255.24s)]
*  I can't remember the sequence of it. It's just kind of happening, and you're in the moment and [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5261.04s)]
*  You're in two places. I'm in the moment reacting doing the things. I was doing with him like we were [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5265.8s)]
*  tussling and [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5270.44s)]
*  I was also like someplace else in this fucking like last moment place [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5271.639999999999s)]
*  Where you're something in you knows like oh shit. This is it because I didn't think I was living [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5276.320000000001s)]
*  I mean, I'm in a car. I know I'm shot it feels ominous. You know I don't know [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5280.84s)]
*  I just you my mind just went this I'm dying. This is it. It's over the whole thing's over [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5285.52s)]
*  You're in this effect you you can cognitively know you can cognitively say to yourself life is finite [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5291.16s)]
*  But you can't really feel it no you can't feel it and unless you're in it [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5299.0s)]
*  And then you're like oh fuck and it's all like the the reality of it being so ephemeral and all going away [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5302.72s)]
*  It's just like it's freaky man. It's like just now when I was talking about I was like oh, that's free [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5308.400000000001s)]
*  It's a you feel like yeah when you get that feeling sometimes like this is all gonna disappear one day [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5313.52s)]
*  It's fucking like just now. I felt translucent. I felt invisible just even was talking about I felt like a blurry [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5318.12s)]
*  It's like oh fuck. This is all blurry. You know in its essence. It's like really like an abstract painting [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5324.400000000001s)]
*  There's nothing defined and we're on the way. It's weird and so I don't know that was a good [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5330.72s)]
*  That was a silver lining of that moment damn [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5336.280000000001s)]
*  But it also takes the pressure off it's scary, but it takes the pressure of going like oh, well you know [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5339.84s)]
*  Yeah, if you're having fun [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5344.280000000001s)]

*  You didn't think you were gonna get married cuz I worry about that sometime [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5411.88s)]
*  I was scared man like when it came when it comes to commitment for me. It's real hard [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5414.56s)]
*  It's real hard, and I had the same thing [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5418.8s)]
*  I I give a lot of credit to my buddy Paul Verzi was a comic who has been married for a long time [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5420.4400000000005s)]
*  Has kids they're kind of grown up was kind of like married before [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5426.52s)]

*  He just helped me he kind of was my like he was like my maverick [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5436.08s)]
*  He guided me in with that like he helped me get the ring. He showed me where to go [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5439.84s)]
*  He talked me through the feelings like on the night. I was gonna propose. This is [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5444.0s)]
*  Honest to God truth. I felt everything in my body was like. I just want to leave [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5449.44s)]
*  Wow, I just wanted to get in the car and drive like Thelma Louise [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5454.36s)]
*  I don't even know where I was going drive away. I just want to drive away [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5458.32s)]
*  I didn't want to do it every fear hit me, and then I did it and it felt incredible [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5461.44s)]
*  It was incredible when I did it [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5468.36s)]
*  But it was the opposite before I couldn't sit still in my skin like I was just like I feel that oh God [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5471.12s)]
*  I was just uncomfortable. I wanted to leave I wanted to get out of my body out of the situation [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5478.4s)]
*  We do but okay, so you have those feelings, but was it telling you the situation is wrong? [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5483.16s)]
*  It the feeling was telling the situation is wrong. Everything's wrong [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5489.2s)]
*  I was doing everything, but it was just the fear of commitment. You know as a fear of commitment [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5492.88s)]
*  It was the fear of the choice. I was making which I knew would have consequences [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5497.44s)]
*  that was something outside of myself, and it has to do with my issues growing up and [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5502.2s)]
*  It's hard. Oh hard to face that shit. That's the scariest thing I could ever think of areas. Yeah, and look marriage is like [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5507.2s)]
*  It's it's work, but it's like stand-ups work too right and we love stand-up. We love comedy. It's work sometimes [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5514.04s)]
*  But like flying on planes and doing all that shit's work, but then we're on stage [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5522.04s)]
*  That's the good part [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5526.16s)]
*  So it's like it's real our love for stand-up is real and I look at my love for my wife [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5527.2s)]
*  And I'm like it's real. You know we fight [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5531.48s)]
*  we have different opinions, but [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5535.16s)]
*  Overall like we support each other all the good you get out of it is [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5538.6s)]
*  Just puts everything in perspective [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5542.68s)]
*  About everything else is not being important and like it's family you have a new family. Yeah, and family never leaves and [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5545.200000000001s)]

*  That's the thing man. I mean I hate to be so cynical about it [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5581.52s)]
*  But no this is all interesting because I feel a lot of these things a lot of people do I think I mean even when [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5585.4400000000005s)]
*  I'm watching your special and the talking about the wedding and stuff and just a lot. It's like fuck when you have a kid [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5590.28s)]
*  You realize what the meaning of life is it's pretty cynical [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5598.32s)]
*  It's no different than a string bean or a cockroach. It's like the meaning of life is kind of just like to reproduce [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5601.639999999999s)]
*  That's what all animals are doing and when you do it. It's like nature [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5607.0s)]
*  You don't even have a choice you just have these feelings of you know you loving something more than yourself [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5610.9s)]
*  And then you like everything just feels easier because like oh you're like oh, that's that's what it's about [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5615.8s)]
*  You're a little like oh, this is fucking this isn't that it's pretty cynical like there's no like [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5620.52s)]
*  Great philosophy to figure out or no apex feeling [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5626.96s)]
*  It's just like to give to her or him or they or they be or whatever your kid. I did them [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5630.68s)]
*  Yeah, just one but yeah [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5636.88s)]
*  You only have one seat yeah [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5639.28s)]
*  But uh that that takes you out of yourself, so maybe anything that takes you out of yourself. Oh, yeah makes you happy [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5641.639999999999s)]
*  Something bigger than you or outside of you yeah, that's the root of a lot of recovery stuff [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5649.16s)]
*  Too is just feeling better as it's getting out of yourself [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5653.2s)]
*  I respect addicts the most in fact like I tell my really good friend [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5655.5199999999995s)]
*  Who's an addict that he's my role model? [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5659.74s)]
*  And I mean that because I know what he has to do [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5662.0s)]
*  I know what he has to go through and [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5664.5199999999995s)]
*  He's built a family and he's sober and just being sober and that he works out so much and put his addiction another place [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5666.56s)]

*  It's just lucky that you don't have that yeah, it's like my dad my dad told me it was very cynical [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5704.52s)]
*  They told me everyone [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5711.360000000001s)]
*  It's luck most of life is luck and that was very disconcerting here as a young person [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5712.96s)]
*  But the way he explained is like even if you have your health like even Michael Jordan you go [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5717.72s)]
*  Michael Jordan that's not luck. That's it. Yeah. Yeah, it is but like he's lucky. He didn't get hit by a car [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5721.96s)]
*  He's lucky we're always lucky if we're like healthy or like you know nothing bad's happen because we don't control that shit [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5727.0s)]
*  You know right they could write shooter come in here right now and end us. Yeah, you already got shot. Yeah, so at this point [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5734.4800000000005s)]

*  But yeah, I can just totally man my whole life [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5747.4s)]
*  I've had that commit that when it comes to relationships and stuff like that commitment [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5749.64s)]
*  You know like not even never wanting to be totally attached to somebody else you know like [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5753.360000000001s)]
*  Even my girlfriends. I would introduce them a lot of times by their first [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5759.200000000001s)]
*  I would just say this is my friend or this is like I would never want to fucking have somebody else [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5762.0s)]
*  Have a say in who I was you know [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5767.200000000001s)]
*  That means you're independent you're strong it does but it's also about commitment like you know it's really about [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5771.6s)]
*  That's true somebody could be independence, but I think some of us about like [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5777.48s)]
*  Yeah, I just want to be totally stand on my own and I don't want if somebody thinks something of that person [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5782.24s)]
*  I don't want it to them think of me like it's like I have some [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5787.8s)]
*  You don't want them to negatively reflect on you right? Yeah, which is kind of a crazy selfish way to think it's not even [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5792.24s)]
*  It's not a choice. I make it's something that was baked into me right [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5798.08s)]
*  You know it's something that I know isn't healthy or conducive to feeling okay [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5801.24s)]
*  Isn't it weird how we're like these sensitive like of this all the species were like this [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5805.620000000001s)]
*  This most sensitive with feelings and Freudian issues like a turtle doesn't think about his childhood [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5810.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, turtles not like my mom didn't [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5816.700000000001s)]
*  But it's very valid for humans. It's weird like they don't have issues [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5819.9800000000005s)]
*  They don't need therapy animals don't need therapy. Yeah, it's what that's why sometimes [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5824.9400000000005s)]
*  I'm like are we this loose end of existence? That's not are we like the appendix? [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5828.9800000000005s)]
*  You know are we like this thing that wasn't supposed to be there like you know like that show lost kind of are we like [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5833.26s)]
*  the thing that [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5839.42s)]
*  Wasn't supposed to happen if you lined all the animals and stuff up like we kind of fit in a little [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5840.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but we're definitely the outsider for sure big time. We need pavement. We need toilets [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5846.3s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good question. Maybe this is just an evolutionary mistake like a [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5854.22s)]
*  You know like a byproduct of like that [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5858.900000000001s)]
*  Evolutionary will that carries species [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5862.22s)]
*  through time [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5865.9s)]
*  into survival and maybe we're just a yeah, maybe we're just a product of that will and they [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5867.86s)]
*  You're like, ah, well the end result of that is not supposed to be [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5874.1s)]
*  What it is because we've made because we kind of mastered it all the other animals still have some weaknesses [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5878.78s)]
*  But we're like Superman of the species. Yeah, we're making shows about me. It's like we're like we're like [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5884.7s)]
*  Yes, like yeah, like we're making shows about life and we're like you're living it. We're like we're doing it twice, right? [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5891.42s)]
*  Oh, yeah, we're doing holograms. We're perfecting. We're making it look perfect. Even though it's not right like [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5897.3s)]
*  Yeah, interesting man. It's interesting to think [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5903.86s)]
*  Yeah, but then also I can feel a God a lot of times I can feel that there's a power that's greater than me [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5906.78s)]
*  You know gotta be so it's like that [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5912.34s)]
*  Makes you think you're connected to something else that there is some purpose [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5916.62s)]
*  You know because I can I mean I have no doubt that I feel a God, you know, so I mean it's just my perception [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5920.54s)]
*  maybe maybe that's what it's maybe we evolved in order to [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5927.06s)]
*  To fucking bitch all the other species who think they're the shit because they walk around arrogant. They're not humble with you only [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=5933.1s)]

*  There was literally even three years ago [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6249.88s)]
*  And I feel like it like doubles the amount of them doubles [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6252.4400000000005s)]
*  I wonder how often because it's crazy like people years ago that were like I remember Chris Chile [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6256.88s)]
*  It's like we're never doing a fucking podcast. I remember Amy Schumer was like [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6262.4400000000005s)]
*  Pooh poo you know and then now everybody's done one or if they can do one they do one [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6265.72s)]
*  Yeah, you know yeah, even people that's damn rich. I think Biden does one. I don't even know he didn't even know if he does one [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6271.6s)]
*  If you ask him he might say yes [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6278.96s)]
*  That freaking child pettiter yeah [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6282.72s)]
*  Let's look at this right here. Oh, did you see this the man? What is this about? [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6287.72s)]
*  This is the guy that attacked Chappelle says he was triggered yeah, yeah, what is it? [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6294.04s)]
*  Yeah, which is it also says an apparent change of an apparent change of tune [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6302.16s)]
*  With that seems like [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6306.24s)]
*  Attorneys probably told him to say this huh yeah, that's a good call [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6308.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, that gives a much more of a leg to stand on I feel like yeah [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6312.8s)]
*  It's like hey this will get some people behind you I thought this was fake actually when I first heard about this [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6317.36s)]
*  Oh, Leah's quoted as saying I identify as bisexual I wanted him to know what he said was triggering [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6324.48s)]
*  I wanted him to the next time you should consider first running his material by people at K-1 [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6329.5199999999995s)]
*  First running his material by people it could affect could you imagine no the arrogance of that statement? [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6334.24s)]
*  Well if this guy's buyer, you know the male side of him should have freaking attacked him [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6340.76s)]
*  Well it's just I don't you can't you can't then you can only don't need to listen to this man [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6349.4s)]
*  Go listen to a man or woman that you and really enjoy I think right I? [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6355.4s)]
*  Thought they hired somebody to do this I really really did [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6360.96s)]
*  Also like it thought that with the slap you know Hollywood's 9-eleven the Will Smith and Chris Rock slap at first [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6364.28s)]
*  I was like that's fake [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6371.26s)]
*  I think a lot of people thought because I guess a lot of people you know we staged shit now everything everyone's got to make [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6372.0s)]
*  a spectacle to [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6377.76s)]
*  Online that's what it's become you know yeah, it's like because we [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6379.92s)]
*  It gets views. I mean the news even does that right they just create a spectacle with their headlines and their [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6384.5599999999995s)]
*  Fear-mongering and all that because it gets views we're all competing to get attention so inevitably [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6390.32s)]
*  you're like did they stage that for attention is always a [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6396.360000000001s)]
*  Question in your brain [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6399.8s)]
*  Yeah, and they beat the guy up pretty good [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6401.32s)]
*  But I'm even if I'm if I'm somebody I don't have anything going on you're like hey [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6405.24s)]
*  I'll give you half a mil two hundred thousand some guys are gonna break a couple of your bones. Can you handle it? [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6408.92s)]
*  If I'm already bisexual I'm probably by [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6414.8s)]
*  Joints or whatever sure I probably take a shoulder out of socket [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6417.72s)]
*  So you say even though you got beat it there is a chance it could still be [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6420.8s)]
*  It could still be fake. Oh, I I'm not saying that it definitely is but I would not have been shocked [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6424.72s)]
*  I think you could find a guy for 200 grand yeah, that would take a take an ass whooping and good potentially [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6430.04s)]
*  He's not gonna go to jail. Do you think you'll go to jail? [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6435.4s)]
*  That's I heard he's getting out, but I mean it happened in Los Angeles, right? [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6438.34s)]
*  I feel like that's what happens in Los Angeles criminals get out. Yeah get off now [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6441.84s)]
*  So I mean especially if he says he was triggered by jokes. I feel like they go like oh we must have had the wrong guy [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6446.04s)]
*  But then I guess if you're trying say if you're trans and this guy's in trans well [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6454.04s)]
*  He doesn't say he says he's bi [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6458.92s)]
*  But then this dude is like you're dang [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6461.12s)]
*  he's like you're a [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6464.28s)]
*  Rudy Rue de Gurk kind of any you know what you know I'm saying like if you're really on that side of the boat [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6466.32s)]
*  He's like you're John Brown. He's uh [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6471.68s)]
*  I don't know John Brown is John Brown was down for Cleveland [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6474.28s)]
*  No, John Brown was the dude who attacked the armory to protest slavery [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6477.08s)]
*  He was down for the like he did the crazy like kind of suicide mission. Oh, he did attack the armory and [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6481.68s)]
*  Yeah, he was like down for the cause, but it's are people like heroizing this guy or the gay and trans community hero hero [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6488.12s)]
*  Heroizing him. I don't know that's a good question. I don't know [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6495.68s)]
*  I don't know how they I think he just came out [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6499.24s)]
*  saying this [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6503.88s)]
*  Maybe they're maybe they're having their meeting now to figure out how to praise him [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6505.8s)]
*  Maybe they're having their media meeting to go like oh, you know now we can now we can like him [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6510.28s)]
*  I don't know what they're doing. Oh, yeah, cuz he's adding in also plus jokes earlier in the night [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6516.4800000000005s)]
*  Made by an opener talking pediaphyllia rocked Lee as well. He says he was sexually abused as a minor [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6521.400000000001s)]
*  Well, that's one of the side effects of being a damn minor these days [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6528.12s)]
*  I feel like dude you gotta get I mean you gotta get into a better industry if you guys are underground [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6531.44s)]
*  Somebody's gonna touch you ass on the way up. Yeah, I'm [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6536.04s)]
*  Disconcerting how much of that is going on like how much I love how the guy's arm is out of socket [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6540.5199999999995s)]
*  They still cough him. Oh [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6545.919999999999s)]
*  Yeah, dude the Lord already cuff this dude [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6551.04s)]
*  Seems a little redundant. Yeah, I mean his arm is backwards. Yeah [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6556.759999999999s)]
*  How did they even get his arm back normal who I mean it looks like he's an action figure and like you pop it out [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6561.919999999999s)]
*  Different way that's 200,000 man. They spat on me and twisted me as if on purpose [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6569.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, no, they definitely they definitely didn't do it on accident he said as a no they weren't doing it [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6577.4s)]
*  They didn't break your arm on accident. Yeah good. At least he's aware of that. This is interesting right here [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6582.4s)]
*  I told him my mother and grandmother who fought for his civil rights to be able to speak would be upset at the things [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6587.46s)]
*  He said this is a perfect example of what you were talking about earlier where things go kind of this full circle way where it's like [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6592.46s)]
*  You you want [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6599.9800000000005s)]
*  Were you saying earlier you said [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6602.42s)]
*  It's like you want to get these freedoms, but at a certain point that kind of like get to free. Yeah, yeah [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6604.58s)]
*  So if there's nowhere to go you like yeah, you look like dude, you know [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6610.18s)]
*  you know how [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6615.26s)]
*  Contradictory what you're saying you're saying my grandparents fought for this right? You're like, yeah, that's why he's a [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6617.9s)]
*  Multi-millionaire comedian speaking freely right who's black, right? Exactly like that's the end of the right? [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6624.42s)]
*  Yeah, that's the end of the road. At a certain point the end [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6631.42s)]
*  You're doing what the cops would do to him back then or maybe sometimes now [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6633.42s)]
*  But you're doing what like white America would have done to him back then so what you're saying makes no fucking sense [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6638.42s)]
*  Makes no fucking sense. You're being the bad person, but he doesn't see that he has no awareness of it [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6644.54s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, he's shutting down a black man doing comedy getting paid millions of dollars [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6649.38s)]
*  Having being adorned by all these people who have paid to see him. You're stopping that because [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6655.34s)]
*  You think you're doing it for civil rights. It's twisted logic [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6662.46s)]
*  Well, it's interesting because it's like what's the thing then is it the vet the fact that you don't want him to like if the money's not [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6665.74s)]
*  Involved then it kind of changes it. What do you mean? Well, I guess like [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6672.48s)]
*  Man, it's sort of think and say stuff [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6678.5599999999995s)]
*  Like [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6683.08s)]
*  You want him to be able to speak [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6686.639999999999s)]
*  Mmm, I don't know what I'm saying exactly what you're saying them if the money's not involved [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6688.759999999999s)]
*  Well, it's like civil rights like you want to you know, freedom of speech like your grand [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6692.879999999999s)]
*  He says my grandmother fought for his freedom of speech, right? Right? So [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6696.5599999999995s)]
*  Now he has that freedom of speech, right? But is it because he's making money like why? [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6701.240000000001s)]
*  Why did he do it? What's his reasoning? Why he did it and what determines like is it what determines if his speech is? [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6707.64s)]
*  Free or not like at what point is it the fact that he's making I don't know what I'm saying exactly [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6717.6s)]
*  Well, I mean the ridiculous thing is he's making jokes, right? So that's a weird it means your society is in a weird place [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6722.4400000000005s)]
*  When the jesters are being attacked? [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6730.28s)]
*  Because right this is specifically a place where he's making jokes. He's making jokes man. He says on the sign [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6733.52s)]
*  It's like this is a comedy show. It's a comedy weekend. I mean even this guy knows that I mean Dave Chappelle is a comedian [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6739.360000000001s)]
*  Dave Chappelle does not work a [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6745.64s)]
*  Autobody shop. Yeah, he's a comedian. Everyone knows who he is. People aren't paying to go watch him fix a car [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6749.04s)]
*  They're watching him do jokes [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6754.34s)]
*  And so when comedians are getting attacked you start going like oh society may be getting a little unhealthy [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6756.54s)]
*  Because the Kings, you know, they would keep a jester around to keep them honest to tell them the truth with jokes [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6762.9800000000005s)]
*  That's what we do. We sugarcoat the truth a little bit [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6770.1s)]
*  So it's like, you know, I just want to say like hey, maybe the jester is right, right? [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6772.14s)]
*  Isn't that what we do? We kind of put a little candy over the truth [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6775.9400000000005s)]
*  Like, you know, yeah, if you don't hear the jester anymore, then that's a little bit strange [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6779.66s)]
*  Then there's something something strange [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6783.38s)]
*  Something's off that's a society is not healthy and it's the black community keeps attacking their own kind [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6785.42s)]
*  Yeah, which is bizarre. That is bizarre [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6791.02s)]
*  All right, what else we got any other good news story came in [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6796.26s)]
*  Sometimes it's nice to podcast because I don't to go deal with the rest of my life. Isn't that crazy? [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6800.78s)]
*  Even though it's a great life. It's like I just have to make choices and do things [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6804.26s)]
*  I think it's same reason why you listen to a podcast or watch a movie [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6808.18s)]
*  It's like sometimes it's like you just don't want to have to I don't know I sound ungrateful [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6811.14s)]
*  No, but I know what you're saying is right now you're in the moment. You're not thinking about yeah, that's what I'm saying [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6815.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I'm having to think about tougher stuff. Yeah, my sister's trying to buy a house. I'm gonna help her look at that [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6821.620000000001s)]
*  It's like I'm have to make choices about you know, all cool stuff, but it's like it just feels like less responsibility right now [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6826.1s)]
*  Well, that's why the audience probably connects with it so much because you like you said you're doing the same thing [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6833.14s)]
*  They're doing we're both taking a break [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6836.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, you're taking a break the audience taking a break and when it's over it's like oh right now [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6839.179999999999s)]
*  I gotta go help my sister buy house. Yeah back to shit [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6843.379999999999s)]
*  Yeah [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6847.139999999999s)]
*  There's probably someone watching right now who also is helping their sister [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6849.299999999999s)]
*  What do we have here [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6856.379999999999s)]
*  Yeah, here's an interesting one New York High Court to determine if Bronx Zoo elephant is a person why not why not [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6858.7s)]
*  2022 why not? [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6866.98s)]
*  Is it a person? I mean what is going on? [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6868.98s)]
*  Has it paid taxes? That's what I want to know [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6872.66s)]
*  I mean, how would they even mix those two up? How would they? [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6878.42s)]
*  If it was a person how did they get how did it get to a point where an article needed to be written that they were [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6882.98s)]
*  Gonna investigate whether it was true [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6888.54s)]
*  How do you mistake those two things ones like ten tons? The other is like 300 pounds if it eats fast food [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6890.62s)]
*  It's a big difference [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6898.06s)]
*  Jesus Christ that [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6900.62s)]
*  Can she can the elephant be considered a person a question was before New York's highest court Wednesday in a closely watched case [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6903.18s)]
*  So whether a basic human right can be extended to an animal. Oh, so it's more that okay. It's more the rights of the animal [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6910.38s)]
*  They said it's in a one-acre prison, you know, this goes back to like black if you see that movie black [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6917.18s)]
*  Black fish [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6924.740000000001s)]
*  It's about like black something happened to black fish even like whenever [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6927.780000000001s)]
*  whales or whatever [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6931.700000000001s)]
*  With the zoo and they put him in there in San Diego and people got upset about it [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6933.18s)]
*  But it's like [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6939.1s)]
*  Do you think if you see our aunt like? [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6941.18s)]
*  The animals safer in this space, but is it getting its true? [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6945.18s)]
*  existence [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6951.620000000001s)]
*  I think that's the question and it's almost the same thing. We've been talking about with humans [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6954.1s)]
*  It's like we're safer in this space for sure. There's bumpers on everything. There's insurance. There's lawyer [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6958.26s)]
*  There's you're as safe as you could be you can buy braces through the mail a woman the other night had me sign her [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6964.580000000001s)]
*  metal leg and it had like a [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6971.820000000001s)]
*  little thing in it where it also sorts coins on the side of it, right like [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6974.740000000001s)]
*  We're living in a fucking brook stone, right? [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6978.9400000000005s)]
*  But are we getting [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6982.06s)]
*  The are we getting the most the most [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6985.5s)]
*  Natural experience that's almost what's happening here, right? Right. Are we not fulfilled? Is it the most fulfilling? [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6989.26s)]
*  Yeah, it's exactly what's happening here. Yeah, the non-human rights project wants her to move from a one acre prison at the zoo to a more spacious [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=6994.94s)]
*  sanctuary [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7001.26s)]
*  Because with all these things are like just set them free [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7003.18s)]
*  Yeah [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7005.94s)]
*  Well, this doesn't even sound like they're returning them to their natural [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7006.42s)]
*  Habitat where they'd be this just is like they're getting they're just they're upgrading their you from a condo to a [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7009.54s)]
*  mansion [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7016.0599999999995s)]
*  To have more spacious, you know [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7017.0599999999995s)]
*  They'd still have that same safety or whatever [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7019.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I'd say maybe the more humane thing ironically would be to put them back into the [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7021.219999999999s)]
*  Being an elephant. Yeah is suited for nature where it can look around, you know, because elephants can intimidate lions, you know [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7027.74s)]
*  Yeah, and that probably makes them feel good and now they don't have that that's taken away, you know [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7034.94s)]
*  I'm a yeah, but that must build an elephant self-esteem when lions come around and be like, you know, we're hungry [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7039.86s)]
*  We may take you down. Yeah, an elephant goes dude. I'm ten tons. You can try it, but I may stop one of you [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7045.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's gonna be bad for somebody. Yeah is something gonna come down and say hey [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7052.219999999999s)]
*  You guys are doing it wrong right go back to [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7059.46s)]
*  But here's the weird thing if we went back [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7063.42s)]
*  Wouldn't we try to get back here to be safer? [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7067.46s)]
*  I don't know that's the thing and who what or who would keep you in line to [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7070.02s)]
*  Yeah, like if someone came up like if we had to survive against [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7075.14s)]
*  Predators that were trying to kill us like back in the day like hyenas sabre-toothed tigers [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7079.58s)]
*  And then there was a dude who figured out a way [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7083.26s)]
*  To like effectively keep them at bay [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7086.1s)]
*  Who would be would there be a judge some sort of judge that came in and be like dude, dude [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7089.02s)]
*  You can't advance that much right? We got to keep it like that. But then even having that judge is kind of advanced [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7093.18s)]
*  So it's a it's a you can't get out of the quagmire. It's a you can't escape it. We're always gonna try to [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7100.06s)]
*  Find a smart way to out smart these predators and that makes us more human and softer because we use our brain [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7107.38s)]
*  That's what we have [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7114.22s)]
*  Gorillas got strength [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7115.58s)]
*  Right. This is almost is this the best-case scenario where we are dude [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7117.7s)]
*  If we're just left to deal with predators with jujitsu [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7121.7s)]
*  I don't know how effective it would be because that's essentially what we're advocating for one more generation [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7126.7s)]
*  We'll have some freaking gangsters out there. I think so probably [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7131.54s)]
*  Yeah, people were they're getting some talent man. John Jones could beat a lot of animals. You think so? [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7135.38s)]
*  Yeah, I think so for a second yeah for a little bit man, I think [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7141.1s)]
*  There's room I mean there's old stories of Dustin Poirier beating, you know 20 raccoons outside of a bar and in Lafayette [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7147.42s)]
*  So try to get jumped by raccoons, but what's a dangerous game? [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7154.26s)]
*  Look there's a [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7158.9400000000005s)]
*  There is there's a lot of I think mythology out there about humans fighting animals [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7160.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah, the Greeks used to have a lot of it did they yeah fighting animals [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7165.660000000001s)]
*  Yeah, cuz we try I mean they try like or is this the best is this where we are is this obviously this is [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7169.46s)]
*  Where we are this is [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7175.34s)]
*  We would probably just do this again, I know what you're saying you're basically saying we overdid it [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7178.18s)]
*  Where we took the fun out of it? [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7183.9400000000005s)]
*  We took like the game out of it [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7185.58s)]
*  Which makes you like think and immerses you in the game of like survival because now we can just nuke [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7187.26s)]
*  Predators that's too much. It's not fair. It's not fair man [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7193.660000000001s)]
*  I always like the idea that people can do [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7197.34s)]
*  Like if somebody wants to fight an animal with a knife or something, I think it's fair [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7200.26s)]
*  You know, I don't sometimes with the hunt and stuff [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7204.38s)]
*  I'm not an anti hunter at all like but I would love to see more hand-to-hand combat with animals [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7206.62s)]
*  That would be great that would be great to see yeah, it's a fair fight [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7214.74s)]
*  I feel like we'd lose a lot though is my only problem. Hell. Yeah, we would do this every week [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7219.22s)]
*  There's a video some guy losing to a goose at a damn local watering hole [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7223.92s)]
*  Yeah, there's some guy's kid getting his one of his ears nipped off by a damn [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7227.400000000001s)]
*  Gosling or whatever. Yeah, I mean even if the gauze and cuts wait [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7232.6s)]
*  Still unfair. It's still fucking it's got that animal strength always got the advantage and that's why I think like we'll always invent a knife [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7236.8s)]
*  Yeah in order to compete or else we go extinct [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7244.76s)]
*  Like dude, you know what the crazy shit is [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7247.8s)]
*  We were not the apex predator for most of our existence only the past couple thousand years [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7249.56s)]
*  Did we figure some shit out but for like hundreds of thousands of years? [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7255.280000000001s)]
*  Fucking we got eaten Wow, we didn't figure it out until we teamed up with dogs [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7259.96s)]
*  They they they they ran did a lot of the recon [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7265.4400000000005s)]
*  They did recon for us and like yo bad shits coming we hid whatever we needed and they fought off lions for us and shit [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7268.400000000001s)]
*  And then we were able to they gave us some time to sit around and think about it and figure shit out [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7273.8s)]
*  Build a knife cuz you can't figure out how to build a knife when you're constantly being hunted [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7277.56s)]
*  Yeah, you can't think it's not a moment to think it's like having anxiety all the time [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7281.6s)]
*  You can't you know, you can't do your best work when you're anxious [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7286.02s)]
*  So Oh Amen, man [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7289.76s)]

*  But when I reach that ground I'll share this piece of my life I can see [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7342.92s)]
*  But it's gonna take a little time [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7352.2s)]
*  For me to set that parking brake and let myself [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosAbWLkNwo&t=7358.28s)]
