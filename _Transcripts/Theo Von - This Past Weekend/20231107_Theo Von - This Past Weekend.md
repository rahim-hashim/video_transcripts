*  I got you, homie. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=239.12s)]
*  I'm not taking my lungs for a walk, you know? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=240.76000000000002s)]
*  I'm just putting down a pee pad [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=243.78s)]
*  and just letting them pee there. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=245.3s)]
*  You know, that's what I'm doing [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=247.56s)]
*  when I'm just kinda like, just not, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=248.56s)]
*  but sometimes when I go, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=251.76s)]
*  that's when I'm really taking my lungs for a walk. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=255.39999999999998s)]
*  Saying, all right, I'm gonna take y'all to the lung park. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=257.88s)]
*  You know, I'm gonna take, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=260.59999999999997s)]
*  I'm gonna throw the ball on watch you go get it. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=261.44s)]
*  You know? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=264.03999999999996s)]
*  So that's, I think there's something about that [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=265.44s)]
*  spending time with your lungs. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=267.8s)]
*  Instead of, I take my lungs for granted, bruh. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=275.56s)]
*  Real talk, I'll be honest, man. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=278.18s)]
*  I take my lungs for granted. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=279.68s)]
*  I'll take, I take my lungs for granted. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=284.24s)]
*  My friend got bit by a shark once and his lung got, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=286.18s)]
*  he got some of his lung got missing or whatever it's called. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=292.56s)]
*  And then he died, he ended up dying actually [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=296.76s)]
*  a few years later from, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=298.6s)]
*  I don't even know where he died from, God. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=302.16s)]
*  People will die from anything. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=304.3s)]
*  They don't even fucking, you know, it's like, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=305.44s)]

*  Sherman, he didn't like to do, you know, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=312.44s)]
*  he was kind of like to just do his own thing, I guess. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=314.0s)]
*  But, but yeah, it's that time of year, I think to breathe. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=318.71999999999997s)]
*  Cause it's when the wind picks up, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=334.52s)]

*  I really am, this shit breaks my heart, you know? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=538.26s)]
*  And here we are trying to learn ways [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=543.58s)]
*  to live off the land again. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=545.1s)]
*  We've gone full circle, I think, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=546.28s)]
*  because we're realizing some of the patterns [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=548.66s)]
*  of our civilization doesn't work out. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=550.1s)]
*  Some of the patterns, the mythological patterns [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=552.54s)]
*  of capitalism and of those sorts of things [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=554.54s)]
*  don't always work out. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=558.26s)]
*  So we're looking for solutions now. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=559.26s)]
*  So yeah, hug a damn Native brother. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=562.2s)]
*  I'm gonna tell you this holiday season. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=564.66s)]
*  Hug a fucking Native baby, buy him a squash, you know? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=566.06s)]
*  You know, buy him a cornucopia. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=569.18s)]
*  You know, buy him a pork chop. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=573.66s)]
*  You know, get him a beautiful piece of meat, shank. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=576.78s)]
*  You know, but treat your Native friends well [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=581.66s)]
*  because they are the leaders. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=584.02s)]
*  They are the champions of time. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=587.5s)]
*  So I'm really grateful to have been there [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=589.98s)]
*  and to have this cut. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=592.18s)]
*  And especially them bitches, you know, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=593.58s)]
*  back in the day, Native, they scalp you. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=595.06s)]
*  So right when I sat down, well, when I sat down, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=598.22s)]
*  his shit, his truck battery had died. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=600.9s)]
*  So we had to use my, I got a Cherokee, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=605.62s)]
*  I got a Cherokee, dude. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=608.3s)]
*  So we used a Cherokee to jumpstart his clippers. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=609.74s)]
*  So that was good, but it was a little risky too [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=617.26s)]
*  because you don't, I don't know how much, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=620.06s)]
*  you know, if you got 470 volts, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=622.02s)]
*  you're rolling through a fucking set of clippers, dog. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=624.5799999999999s)]

*  he'll line you up with the Lord, baby, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=634.62s)]
*  if you're not real careful, you know? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=639.06s)]
*  So God, that bitch was at a high octave. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=640.5s)]
*  You know, the second he put it on, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=644.74s)]
*  the dogs were howling a couple of streets over and shit [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=646.34s)]
*  and what we got it done is so thank you, Dreamer, baby. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=650.74s)]

*  Here's what happened. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=720.26s)]
*  So I had some shows in Las Vegas [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=721.14s)]
*  and thank you for coming out. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=723.38s)]
*  Somebody urinated on someone at one of the shows. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=725.42s)]
*  They said it was an accident. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=728.06s)]
*  It couldn't have been. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=729.14s)]
*  But that's okay, baby. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=731.3399999999999s)]
*  God does stuff like that and we move forward. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=732.62s)]
*  But it was really, really exciting. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=738.3s)]
*  I've been doing some bigger shows [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=739.5799999999999s)]
*  just because even at this rate, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=741.0999999999999s)]

*  So I know there's some places where tickets have sold out. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=745.18s)]
*  Don't go pay extra for fancy tickets. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=748.78s)]
*  We'll come back and you get it at a fair rate. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=752.26s)]
*  So don't do that. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=755.5799999999999s)]
*  It don't feel bad. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=756.98s)]
*  But yeah, so anyway, I got to go hang out. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=760.98s)]
*  I got to go see the chain smoker, right? [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=764.62s)]
*  I've seen them before in passing, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=767.5799999999999s)]

*  he's from another country. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=799.7s)]
*  And when he comes out, man, he means it. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=802.66s)]
*  He's almost like, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=806.62s)]
*  it almost seems like he's like Santa, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=809.34s)]
*  like he could be related to Santa. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=810.9s)]
*  Cause he came on stage and it was a, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=813.1s)]
*  the vibe was great, right? [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=815.74s)]
*  But he comes on and he was having so much fun [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=817.94s)]
*  that it just changed the whole energy. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=820.7s)]
*  It just like took the whole energy of the place [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=823.3000000000001s)]
*  into like a new, like another level of joy. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=826.1400000000001s)]
*  And it was just nice to see. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=832.74s)]
*  And the things that he was, he, it was Halloween. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=835.82s)]
*  And he just, he was dressed like a part of like a muffler. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=839.22s)]
*  It's like a catalytic converter or something. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=841.86s)]
*  It was like a helmet. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=843.46s)]
*  I don't remember what it was. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=844.5400000000001s)]
*  It was crazy looking like a car part or something. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=845.38s)]
*  Like a hero at AutoZone, right? [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=848.1s)]
*  And he rolled, he comes out on stage on, in that, right? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=854.22s)]
*  And just, you know, half of a air filter cover [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=858.06s)]
*  with eye holes and he's just having a blast, man. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=863.06s)]
*  He was having so much fun. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=865.74s)]
*  And it took, it just made everybody have such a good time. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=868.74s)]
*  And so then he was like, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=873.74s)]
*  I had such a good time. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=875.5s)]
*  And so then like you would think, oh, if it's a DJ set, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=877.38s)]
*  because chain smokers are DJs, right? [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=880.9000000000001s)]
*  They play DJ music. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=882.82s)]
*  So they played like Ed Sheeran's like most upbeat song. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=884.58s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=887.22s)]
*  I don't have it here in front of me, but. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=888.86s)]
*  And if you're on the YouTubes, you can hear, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=891.3000000000001s)]
*  you can see I'm putting video in here [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=892.9000000000001s)]
*  because that's what I'm doing today with this. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=894.26s)]
*  And, but then they, as soon as the song would end, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=896.5400000000001s)]
*  he thought he was just gonna do like one song [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=902.0600000000001s)]
*  with the chain smoker guys. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=903.94s)]
*  Then he, they would start one of his next songs, all right? [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=906.2600000000001s)]
*  So, so it kept getting like more ballad-y, you know, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=910.0200000000001s)]
*  cause he sings like a lot of ballads and just, you know, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=914.94s)]
*  he's, you know, he's got that emo Ed, baby. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=917.0200000000001s)]
*  He's the, you know, he's that, you know, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=918.94s)]
*  he's that emo Ganger, baby, that's who he is. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=922.1800000000001s)]
*  And, and he's a masterful at it. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=924.4200000000001s)]
*  And, and so it kept getting more ballad-y. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=927.82s)]
*  And so at first you were like, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=930.3800000000001s)]
*  there's no way everybody's just gonna go along with this [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=932.02s)]
*  because it was kind of this up, it was like this, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=934.26s)]
*  you know, it was more hype in there. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=936.54s)]
*  And then everybody just goes more and more ballad-y [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=938.42s)]
*  till it's like, we're almost just at a, [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=942.06s)]
*  at a Ed Sheeran show. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=945.18s)]
*  And I think by the end he's singing perfect [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=948.18s)]
*  and everybody's like singing along. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=950.3s)]
*  People are crying. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=951.9s)]
*  Somebody's admitting to somebody else [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=952.78s)]
*  that they're their real parent or something right next to me. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=954.9399999999999s)]
*  I'm like, what? [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=957.26s)]
*  What the fuck? [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=958.8199999999999s)]
*  Homie, get a gin and tonic and chill, dude. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=960.14s)]
*  You about to pay some back child support, buddy. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=964.06s)]
*  That's insane, brother. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=966.3s)]
*  But it was just, it was just interesting to see [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=970.58s)]
*  if somebody shows up with a good energy [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=973.14s)]
*  and, or if somebody really shows up with a good energy [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=976.98s)]
*  that it can change the vibe of a space. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=980.98s)]
*  So that was just a neat, it was just a neat reminder [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=986.06s)]
*  to see that live and in person. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=988.5s)]
*  So I want to let you know also this holiday season, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=990.22s)]
*  we're going to do something called relative rodeo, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=993.14s)]
*  where if you, if you can get, you know, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=995.38s)]
*  here's how you do it. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=998.22s)]
*  What you want to get is somebody hugging somebody [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=999.06s)]
*  in the family they don't usually hug. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=1001.22s)]
*  So, you know, it'd be like, hey, Jonathan, go hug Vanessa. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=1005.34s)]
*  And one of you just secretly kind of films it [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=1010.38s)]
*  and it's relative rodeo. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=1014.06s)]
*  How long can you hold, you know, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=1015.58s)]
*  don't get obscene. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=1017.9s)]
*  Don't, you know, nobody needs to E Jack or nothing. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=1018.9399999999999s)]
*  This is calm, this calm behavior. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=1022.14s)]
*  These are good people. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=1024.02s)]
*  But yeah, that's what it is. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=1025.82s)]
*  We're just going to see, want to promote some love out there. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=1026.86s)]
*  Cause sometimes, you know, uncle Henry's over there [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=1029.22s)]
*  and he don't like anybody fucking getting close to him [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=1032.3799999999999s)]
*  or he will fucking chew his own shirt off. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=1036.18s)]
*  You know, cause he's got, you know, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=1040.42s)]
*  he's got fucking shingles in his fucking brain. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=1042.46s)]
*  So that's when you tell, you know, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=1047.46s)]
*  get a family member say, won't you go hug him? [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=1052.94s)]
*  Let's see how long you can stay on him [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=1056.0600000000002s)]
*  and just send me that those videos. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=1057.8600000000001s)]
*  And that's for during Thanksgiving time, you know, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=1059.6200000000001s)]

*  and you just don't feel like you have the right tools [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=1971.76s)]
*  to do what they did, and being a young man in a factory, [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=1974.4s)]
*  and that's all you got to your name, [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=1981.5s)]
*  sometimes it feels like you're not doing enough yourself. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=1983.0s)]

*  but I'm just sharing, I can relate to a little bit of that. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2012.66s)]
*  But I think that you have to look at your family [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2015.58s)]
*  as a group in a way, you have to look at your blood as, [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2019.02s)]
*  that's the, sort of the marker for you, you know? [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2027.4199999999998s)]
*  You're all part, you know, it takes everybody [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2031.6599999999999s)]
*  to get somebody out of the mud sometimes. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2034.22s)]
*  It takes everybody. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2037.72s)]
*  You know, sometimes you might have an older sibling [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2040.06s)]
*  that took a couple L's so you didn't have to. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2041.6999999999998s)]
*  You know, you might have somebody that's dealt [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2044.74s)]
*  with addiction or dealt with, you know, [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2046.38s)]
*  took like abuse from a parent or something, [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2050.7s)]
*  so then you, the next kid didn't, you know, [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2052.8s)]
*  it's like, it's all, so one person's success [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2054.9s)]
*  is really, it's a familial, it's a familial effort, I think. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2059.9s)]
*  So I think if there's a way to take pride in it [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2066.64s)]
*  as a family, like wow, look what our family [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2071.18s)]
*  has accomplished here, you know, we have a family member [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2075.2200000000003s)]
*  that's a great singer or a family member [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2077.7400000000002s)]

*  Would you play for them something that you made? [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2112.04s)]
*  Or would you show them a house that you had built [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2113.7999999999997s)]
*  or painted? [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2116.08s)]
*  I think there's a lot of things like that. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2118.12s)]
*  Unfortunately, I think we have a society sometimes [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2120.52s)]
*  that doesn't measure a lot of successes like that, [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2122.3599999999997s)]
*  but that's just our society's choice at this time. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2125.12s)]
*  I don't think that that's a realistic. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2128.16s)]
*  I think that is an error, an errorful way [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2130.52s)]
*  that we have gone off on. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2134.8799999999997s)]
*  But what else? [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2138.56s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2143.12s)]
*  But yeah, I think in trying to have, [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2144.52s)]
*  trying to maybe sometimes, I'm a fan of, [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2148.3999999999996s)]
*  I have a sister that's a nurse, [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2150.24s)]
*  sometimes I'll wonder what she's doing [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2151.3599999999997s)]
*  or think about if she's giving somebody an IV [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2153.74s)]
*  or if she's sitting there joking, [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2157.58s)]
*  laughing with her coworkers or something. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2159.38s)]
*  Or, and I'll almost pretend like I'll pretend [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2161.38s)]
*  like I'm there being her for a second. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2164.62s)]
*  Or my brother is a, he's a tree guy. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2166.82s)]
*  He did trees for a long time [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2172.26s)]
*  and now he is doing some more entrepreneurial, [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2174.18s)]
*  trying to learn some arts and stuff like that [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2178.5s)]
*  and music theory and different things that he really enjoys. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2180.68s)]
*  And now he's doing different stuff. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2185.54s)]
*  And, but I was always so envious [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2187.54s)]
*  that he had like a business. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2190.2599999999998s)]
*  We had like a, we had a handful of employees, [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2191.9s)]
*  but he woke up and he had a business. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2195.54s)]
*  And I always, I don't know, there would be, [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2198.56s)]
*  sometimes I would like just fantasize [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2201.18s)]
*  that I was sitting in the work truck with him or, [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2204.2599999999998s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2208.3s)]
*  But yeah, it's hard, it's hard not to be envious. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2209.82s)]
*  And I think some of that can come at times that's normal. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2213.1s)]
*  It's just like recognizing it. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2215.18s)]
*  And also I think if it's a family member [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2217.54s)]
*  that's had some success, they'll recognize the parts [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2221.9s)]
*  that you've had in the making of their success. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2224.94s)]
*  You know? [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2229.62s)]

*  into something different? [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2257.06s)]
*  Like, hey, I'm Clay. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2259.38s)]

*  And instead of some Rockford Fiske, [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2325.34s)]

*  You're like, damn, brother. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2338.26s)]
*  So it's unfortunate, man. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2342.3s)]
*  We got involved in a damn pyramid scheme. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2344.98s)]
*  We got somebody was doing glitter mining by us. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2347.2200000000003s)]
*  A man came through and over [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2351.6600000000003s)]
*  and bought a damn Gibson's parking lot. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2355.02s)]
*  And they got about 12 of us. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2357.02s)]
*  And we lost all that shit, man. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2362.2200000000003s)]
*  They never paid up and, oh, [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2363.9s)]
*  ended some marriages and everything. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2367.3s)]
*  One of the marriages was illegal anyway, [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2369.7400000000002s)]
*  so they shouldn't even have been fucking, honestly. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2371.26s)]
*  So that was a blessing. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2374.6600000000003s)]

*  Let's hear more, buddy. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2406.1000000000004s)]
*  I wanted some advice from you. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2408.38s)]
*  So I just graduated high school. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2410.1400000000003s)]
*  I became a welder, so now I'm doing that. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2412.58s)]
*  Amen, baby. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2415.58s)]
*  Way to get a trade right out the gate. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2416.4199999999996s)]
*  Get a trade. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2417.8599999999997s)]
*  Hell yeah, dude. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2419.7s)]
*  But I'm working night shift right now, [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2421.4199999999996s)]

*  family, anything like that. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2425.98s)]
*  So I was thinking that maybe when I turn 19, [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2427.7s)]
*  I might join the law enforcement academy [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2430.8599999999997s)]
*  and try to go down that route. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2432.9399999999996s)]

*  Yeah, in America, that's enough to give you a weapon [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2449.58s)]
*  and get you out there. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2452.38s)]

*  and I would do painting over there [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2543.02s)]
*  and I would get stung by bees and bitten by animals. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2544.5s)]
*  And I loved it out there and they gave me a gun too. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2548.18s)]

*  and it was some South American Indian. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2599.1s)]
*  But some of that blood flowed through him, you know? [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2603.66s)]
*  And, oh, I think we've taken such a detour [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2607.14s)]
*  from being so disconnected from our earth and planet. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2611.3399999999997s)]
*  And I think it's one of the reasons [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2613.8199999999997s)]
*  why we have so much sickness in the world today [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2615.22s)]
*  and mental, emotional sickness. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2617.18s)]
*  Because we're just supposed to be part of nature [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2620.62s)]
*  and we are on some other shit. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2628.5s)]
*  We're on some other shit. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2632.06s)]
*  I wanna ask you something. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2634.18s)]

*  of loneliness, boredom, anxiety, depression. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2659.18s)]

*  how does it go throughout the week, the haircare? [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2891.0s)]
*  How is it? [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2893.58s)]
*  It does not fall it freely during the week, [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2896.2s)]
*  but I had my friend with me this weekend. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2898.8199999999997s)]
*  I have a family get together. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2900.68s)]
*  And so we can coordinate with doing this [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2902.2s)]
*  and getting it re-braided. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2905.2s)]
*  I have to keep it braided because otherwise, [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2906.56s)]
*  by the end of the day, my tail is dragging. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2909.6s)]
*  All of my tails are dragging [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2911.8799999999997s)]
*  because it's actually longer than I am. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2913.64s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2915.8999999999996s)]
*  So you've really outdone yourself, literally. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2916.74s)]
*  It's one of those things. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2919.48s)]
*  It's like, really, you tried to do that? [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2920.3799999999997s)]
*  No, just life happened. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2921.7599999999998s)]
*  I haven't had it. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2923.4399999999996s)]
*  Yeah, did you get forgetful? [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2924.2799999999997s)]
*  Were you in a coma or something? [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2925.3999999999996s)]
*  How'd you get it that long? [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2926.6s)]
*  How long is it? [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2928.52s)]
*  It is 68 inches long when it's fully stretched out. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2930.22s)]
*  I am only 64 inches tall. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2934.34s)]
*  Okay, so there you go. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2936.62s)]
*  You've out, yeah. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2938.06s)]
*  Wow. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2939.22s)]
*  That's so long. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2940.58s)]
*  And do you get scared? [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2941.94s)]
*  Like you, cause you, it must be a little risk in there, [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2942.86s)]
*  like if you, you know, a mistake and you're a box fan [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2945.94s)]
*  or something like that and your afternoon could change, [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2950.36s)]
*  how you being a neck brace? [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2953.14s)]
*  I know where my tail is. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2955.22s)]
*  I'm pretty tail aware now. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2956.7799999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2958.2599999999998s)]
*  And like I said, it stays in a braid. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2960.0600000000004s)]
*  So, and where I work, I usually wear a back brace [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2961.26s)]
*  because I'm old and it tames the tail. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2964.6600000000003s)]
*  Okay, I see. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2967.82s)]
*  And when I sit down, it's funny. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2968.6600000000003s)]
*  My nurse manager, she actually says, [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2970.82s)]
*  I laugh every time you sit down to draw blood [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2973.2200000000003s)]
*  because I automatically just throw it over my left leg. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2975.02s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2977.98s)]
*  It's like, I know where it is. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2979.34s)]
*  That's beautiful. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2980.5800000000004s)]
*  Yeah, there's something lovely about that, you know? [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2981.42s)]
*  Does it almost, does it almost feel like a pet? [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2983.26s)]
*  Does it almost feel like a friend or something? [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2985.7000000000003s)]
*  Oh no, not a bit. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2988.94s)]
*  It's just, it's something I've had for 33 and a half years [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2992.06s)]
*  now, so yes, it is a part of me. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2995.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2997.3s)]
*  Oh yeah, I can imagine. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2998.2200000000003s)]
*  Well, you know, I have a, just a starter kit going on [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=2999.1400000000003s)]
*  on the back of my head, but I- [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3002.86s)]
*  Dude, you got a mullet, you're good. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3005.82s)]
*  Well, we'll see, you know? [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3007.6200000000003s)]
*  It feels like me. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3009.6600000000003s)]
*  Once my hair got longer, it just felt like me. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3011.1400000000003s)]
*  It was like, oh, this is where I'm always supposed to be. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3014.06s)]
*  This is the way my head is supposed to have been. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3016.1800000000003s)]
*  Do you feel most comfortable with your hair like that? [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3019.7000000000003s)]
*  Like, would you feel very out of sorts, you think, [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3021.2200000000003s)]
*  if you had to take it off? [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3024.82s)]
*  I saw something once and somebody just come up [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3027.6600000000003s)]
*  and cut somebody's hair and it made me nauseous. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3030.5400000000004s)]
*  I actually had a tail prior to this one back in 89 [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3033.9s)]
*  and I cut it and it was only, you know, [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3040.6600000000003s)]
*  probably about five or six inches, which I still have. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3042.9s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3045.1800000000003s)]
*  I immediately felt this angst. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3046.02s)]
*  I was like, okay, that ain't gonna happen. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3049.14s)]
*  So February 9th, 1990, I started growing this one. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3050.74s)]
*  So yes, it has a birthday. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3053.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3054.38s)]
*  So how old is it? [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3056.42s)]
*  It is 33 and a half. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3058.38s)]
*  It'll be 34 years, February the 9th. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3059.46s)]
*  Praise God, baby. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3061.34s)]
*  And if we plucked a strand of it or a cord of it [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3062.34s)]
*  and we tested it, what would it test positive for? [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3065.78s)]
*  Cause you got a long- [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3069.18s)]
*  Well, I always told everybody I couldn't do drugs [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3070.02s)]
*  in my life because you can literally do a drug test on hair. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3072.1s)]
*  And I would have been in so much trouble, [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3075.02s)]
*  but I've been a good girl. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3076.78s)]
*  I don't do that stuff. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3077.62s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3078.5s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3079.7s)]
*  Damn boy. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3080.54s)]
*  Cause yeah, I think, yeah, there's just so much of it. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3081.38s)]
*  You'd really be able to just kind of, [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3084.22s)]
*  you could probably find the exact Friday night [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3085.98s)]
*  that you smoked a joint if somebody wanted [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3087.98s)]
*  to get real particular on there. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3090.78s)]
*  What does your mother think of it? [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3092.82s)]
*  What does she think of your long hair [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3094.14s)]
*  and your world record now? [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3095.5s)]
*  Cause you're in the record books, aren't you? [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3096.58s)]
*  Yes. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3099.38s)]
*  I actually have my beautiful, [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3100.22s)]
*  in this world record book here. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3102.1s)]
*  Yeah, that's so cool. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3104.34s)]
*  And I, yeah, I said I've- [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3105.78s)]

*  That's awesome. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3114.86s)]
*  That'd be me. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3116.7000000000003s)]
*  But back to my mom, I said, [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3118.5s)]
*  somebody made a negative comment once and they said, [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3119.98s)]
*  oh, they must be so proud. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3121.86s)]
*  And I said, well, actually my mom's probably up in heaven [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3123.26s)]
*  looking down, laughing her butt off now. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3126.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3128.1400000000003s)]
*  My mom passed away a few years ago, [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3128.98s)]
*  but yeah, I think she would think it was hilarious. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3130.1400000000003s)]
*  Oh, that's cool. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3132.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, she's probably getting a good laugh out of it. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3133.06s)]
*  Oh, oh yeah. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3135.58s)]
*  She'd probably be like, well, it's just her hair. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3136.74s)]
*  I'm like, yes, mother. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3138.2999999999997s)]
*  Now, do people, what are some of the nicknames? [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3139.2599999999998s)]

*  maybe Billy Ray Ponzle maybe, or I'm trying to think of- [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3144.14s)]
*  I like that one, really great punzle. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3147.02s)]
*  I think I probably started mine before he had his. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3149.66s)]
*  No, it's just the tail. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3152.18s)]
*  Everybody knows me for my hair. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3153.74s)]
*  I mean, people can't remember my name, [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3155.94s)]
*  but they go, I want the one with the long hair. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3158.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3159.82s)]
*  And it was so funny because when I was on deployment [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3160.7799999999997s)]
*  with the state guard during COVID, [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3164.8199999999997s)]
*  I was in uniform all the time. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3166.8999999999996s)]
*  So after I got off COVID and I got hired [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3168.7s)]
*  at the health department, [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3170.66s)]
*  I didn't have to have my hair tucked anymore [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3171.9399999999996s)]
*  because I didn't in uniform. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3173.62s)]
*  And the people were just like, you've always had that? [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3175.3399999999997s)]

*  I have to have somebody do it for me. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3275.46s)]
*  Now that's kind of interesting. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3276.9s)]
*  You have to have a partner really to get, [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3277.94s)]
*  to keep that hair well. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3279.54s)]
*  Yep, and she's been in some of the videos [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3281.54s)]
*  that Guinness put out, [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3283.78s)]
*  because they did a whole photo shoot, which was really cool. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3285.94s)]
*  And they've done different videos [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3288.7400000000002s)]
*  and I found a lot of them online. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3290.26s)]
*  I mean, because his story got out, which was amazing. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3293.1s)]
*  And I mean, some of the people's got the video. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3296.94s)]
*  So my brother, who is more technological than I am, [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3299.14s)]
*  he actually filmed the whole thing where she took it down [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3302.38s)]
*  and he did it in fast motion. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3305.14s)]
*  And then we did a whole time of braiding it [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3307.58s)]
*  because it takes her about an hour and 15 minutes. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3309.14s)]
*  To braid it. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3311.4199999999996s)]
*  By the time she, yeah, by the time she braids it [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3312.2599999999998s)]
*  and rewraps it, because I put a little crochet floss [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3314.74s)]
*  at the top, keep from getting so fuzzy, [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3316.7s)]
*  put little beads on the end. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3319.1s)]
*  Oh damn, I think you're getting it ready for church, huh? [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3320.58s)]

*  What do you guys do over there? [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3326.2599999999998s)]
*  Well, you know, I joked to somebody [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3327.4199999999996s)]
*  because they asked, are you getting haircare product [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3330.2999999999997s)]
*  promos? [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3332.62s)]

*  It's actually a pretty good product, [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3347.94s)]
*  but I've used several things through the years, [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3349.1s)]
*  but I like stuff with Argonne. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3350.86s)]
*  I have shampoo, condition, and then a leave-in conditioner [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3351.86s)]
*  right before she braids it. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3357.14s)]
*  Oh, that's beautiful. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3358.2999999999997s)]
*  God, that's beautiful. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3359.18s)]

*  that we don't know that much about. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3949.22s)]

*  as some of that's been because it's been stress. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3980.22s)]
*  My stress gets built up and it's hard for me to [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3986.2999999999997s)]
*  breathe. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=3992.46s)]

*  from somewhere in my brain [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4001.94s)]
*  or in my feelings or whatever. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4004.3799999999997s)]

*  Like, mess with my friend. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4149.3s)]
*  Okay, so you paid a brother $3 to mess with your friend. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4151.54s)]
*  Okay, we got it. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4154.820000000001s)]

*  And definitely does. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4165.18s)]
*  He slapped him and he kept on requesting more and more money [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4167.860000000001s)]
*  and he keeps on trying to get me to send him more money [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4171.54s)]
*  and I don't really know what to do. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4174.58s)]
*  Dang, homie, that's what... [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4177.900000000001s)]

*  you know what I'm saying? [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4182.54s)]
*  You can't be expecting $5 behavior. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4183.700000000001s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4189.54s)]
*  You can't even be expecting $10 behavior [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4190.38s)]
*  out of $3 brother or any $3 hit man. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4192.78s)]
*  So I think you gotta top him off with the extra that money. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4196.42s)]
*  I'd get him another seven and say, [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4200.74s)]

*  He wanna see, you know, [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4223.98s)]
*  because sometimes people get motivated a little bit. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4225.46s)]
*  It doesn't matter what the avenue is, [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4227.46s)]
*  whether it's for the good or the bad. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4229.7s)]

*  There was a John Travolta touched, [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4317.18s)]
*  well, my buddy's daddy said John Travolta touched his leg [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4321.06s)]
*  once up there on a ferry. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4323.54s)]

*  you really like Maine and I saw you up here in Portland [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4331.74s)]
*  about a year ago when you came out your special. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4335.3s)]
*  We just had a first mass shooting in Maine [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4339.9400000000005s)]
*  and it was actually right down the road from me [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4344.06s)]
*  at a bowling alley and a bar that I've gone to before [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4346.26s)]
*  and I've gone to the bowling alley quite a bit. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4349.7s)]
*  I've always read about this stuff happening in other places [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4355.74s)]
*  and it just kind of hits at home. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4358.42s)]
*  I mean, literally right down the road. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4362.3s)]
*  I know a 14 year old boy was killed [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4366.58s)]
*  and it was like a youth night at the bowling alley [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4368.42s)]
*  and I think our whole community up here [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4370.9400000000005s)]
*  is really taken back by it. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4374.1s)]
*  I didn't have any family involved. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4378.34s)]
*  I just knew of a few people who passed away [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4379.740000000001s)]
*  and obviously it's a small community and knew who they were. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4382.780000000001s)]
*  I just don't, I don't think anyone around here [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4386.9s)]
*  really knows how to move forward past this. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4390.299999999999s)]
*  I mean, with time I guess, but I just don't, [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4392.94s)]
*  I don't know how people do it being in a bigger city [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4398.94s)]
*  and just kind of stuff happening all the time. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4401.299999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's not normal. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4403.42s)]

*  Yeah, it happened in Nashville. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4419.14s)]
*  Every year there's a place that gets it, Uvalde. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4422.66s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know what to say. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4427.62s)]
*  Maybe you're not even looking for me to say anything. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4429.94s)]
*  Maybe you're just looking for somebody [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4433.98s)]

*  I just try to like close my eyes [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4470.740000000001s)]
*  and just think about how wonderful they are. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4472.1s)]
*  I think how I do it. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4475.18s)]
*  Let me think how I do it. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4476.18s)]
*  Yeah, and I think I just wish I could do anything [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4483.7s)]

*  When you said it's not normal, it's so true. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4509.66s)]
*  It's not normal. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4513.86s)]
*  I don't know, you know, it's a good question. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4518.66s)]
*  It's not normal. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4520.82s)]
*  We shouldn't do this to each other. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4521.94s)]
*  Other countries don't do this. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4523.419999999999s)]
*  You know, I think every society is really an experiment. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4525.94s)]
*  You know, we've learned a little bit [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4533.94s)]
*  from previous societies that stays around, [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4535.0199999999995s)]
*  but societies get manipulated and compromised [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4536.74s)]
*  by different forces and dark forces. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4540.62s)]
*  And then it's the experiment changes. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4543.66s)]
*  But yeah, it'd be nice if we could go back to a time where [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4549.66s)]
*  we were just more connected to the nature, you know? [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4553.9s)]
*  And when you saw a deer, it would just like, [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4557.82s)]
*  it wouldn't run maybe. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4560.58s)]
*  It would be a dragon. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4562.98s)]
*  You know, I don't know. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4570.099999999999s)]
*  That could be fucking delusional too. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4571.099999999999s)]
*  But also back then, a fucking raccoon, [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4573.0199999999995s)]
*  you might be looking at a deer and then two raccoons [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4575.0599999999995s)]
*  jump out the tree and fuck you up. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4577.379999999999s)]
*  You know, that's the weird thing. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4579.54s)]
*  It's like, is it normal? [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4581.46s)]
*  Does it nature always just devolve into something anarchal? [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4584.339999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4590.9s)]
*  It's not comfortable. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4592.94s)]
*  And yeah, I'm sorry that that happened in your community. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4597.94s)]
*  I'm sorry that every year there's new communities where it happens. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4599.94s)]
*  But sometimes I start to believe that we're going to get to fit. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4605.94s)]
*  We're going to figure this out. We're going to get out of this. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4608.94s)]
*  We're going to get out of this pain. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4613.94s)]
*  We're going to climb out, you know? [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4616.94s)]
*  The river can see the moon. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4620.94s)]
*  In the distance of the seventh moon, the oyster listens to his family. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4623.94s)]
*  Like, look dude, I gotta get... [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4628.94s)]
*  Look, I just need one of these sovereigns a little, you know... [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4630.94s)]
*  Hey, can you just fade this up a little? [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4634.94s)]
*  The tree learns his ways from the wind. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4636.94s)]
*  Yeah, I understand that. Can you... I just... I gotta get this... [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4639.94s)]
*  Can you... [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4643.94s)]
*  I gotta get this fade a little tighter, man. You know? [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4645.94s)]
*  Do not change horses in the middle of the river. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4650.94s)]
*  Yeah, look man, I totally agree. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4653.94s)]
*  I got four minutes I gotta be up that onramp. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4655.94s)]
*  So can we... I got... Yeah. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4659.94s)]
*  You just tie... Just this side. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4661.94s)]
*  Even it up a little bit, please. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4663.94s)]
*  Alright guys, I gotta get... I gotta go. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4666.94s)]
*  I've been on here for a long time. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4670.94s)]
*  But... [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4674.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4679.94s)]
*  I just gotta remember to breathe, man. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4680.94s)]
*  They must want us to breathe. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4688.94s)]
*  God must want us to breathe because he gave us two places to breathe out of. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4690.94s)]
*  You know? [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4697.94s)]
*  You could do it frontwards, backwards. You could do the... [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4702.94s)]
*  Backwards, frontwards. That's the only way you can do it. Breathing. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4706.94s)]
*  But... Yeah. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4712.94s)]
*  But anyway... Sorry. I think my brain's just getting tired. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4715.94s)]
*  I wanna thank you guys for your continued support. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4721.94s)]
*  And... What else? It's nice, man. It's a nice time of year. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4725.94s)]
*  It's a great time of year to keep our eyes open and keep our hearts open. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4729.94s)]
*  Do our best. Back off that wiener, baby. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4733.94s)]
*  And let the Lord touch you. That's what I'm saying. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4738.94s)]
*  Dehand that wiener. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4743.94s)]
*  And let the Lord touch you. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4746.94s)]
*  That's what I'm saying, baby. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4750.94s)]
*  So I'm feeling that. I'm feeling... Just feeling excited about that. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4752.94s)]
*  Getting in touch with... [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4756.94s)]
*  With... Just better intentions and spirits this holiday season. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4758.94s)]
*  What else? I feel like there's something I'm supposed to tell you, but I can't remember what it was. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4765.94s)]
*  God bless everybody in Israel and Palestine. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4770.94s)]
*  They gotta figure some freedom out over there, man. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4774.94s)]
*  You know, usually when you hear free a place, free Tibet, free Cuba, there needs to be some freeing. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4777.94s)]
*  There's... You know, you don't... Otherwise, you don't hear it. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4783.94s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? You don't hear the thing. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4786.94s)]
*  You don't hear free America. You don't hear free Israel. You don't hear free Russia. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4788.94s)]
*  You don't hear free Michigan. You don't hear it. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4797.94s)]
*  So usually it's a good sign that they gotta figure something out. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4803.94s)]
*  But I'm praying for my friends in pain. I'm praying for those people in pain. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4809.94s)]
*  It's just... It's a lot. Being alive sometimes is a lot. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4816.94s)]
*  Anyway, sorry. I didn't mean to get in a sad space there, but... [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4831.94s)]
*  We gotta go out and do our best, baby. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4837.94s)]
*  And I love you guys. And... [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4840.94s)]
*  What can we roll out on? [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4843.94s)]
*  This one will get us there. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4848.94s)]
*  How about... Enjoy this one right here. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4849.94s)]
*  You guys be good to yourselves, baby. You deserve it. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONryErGHwi4&t=4854.94s)]
