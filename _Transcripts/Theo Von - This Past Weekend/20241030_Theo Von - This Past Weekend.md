*  No. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=77.28s)]
*  But it was packed. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=78.28s)]
*  95%. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=79.28s)]
*  Yeah, it was crazy. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=80.28s)]
*  They got a lot of horses up there, too. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=83.28s)]
*  I've been to the horse track up there. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=88.72s)]
*  Yeah, I was just gonna say, don't they do like derbies and stuff? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=92.32000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=95.52s)]
*  It's nice. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=96.52s)]
*  Some of the horses are strong. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=97.52s)]
*  Some of them aren't that strong. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=98.52s)]
*  What else has been going on? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=99.52s)]
*  Yeah, I was just up in Montana. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=102.52s)]
*  We had some shows up there. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=104.52000000000001s)]
*  Met some Native Americans up there. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=105.52000000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=107.08s)]
*  You ever met any Native Americans? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=108.08s)]
*  Like a real life one? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=109.08s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=110.08s)]
*  We met a couple up there. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=111.08s)]
*  They're pretty cool, man. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=114.76s)]
*  We was up at AutoZone up there and they had a couple of Native Americans up there and [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=116.24000000000001s)]
*  we met them. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=121.72s)]
*  Yeah, they're just wild. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=122.72s)]
*  They have a lot of good weed, too, a lot of times. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=127.24000000000001s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=129.24s)]
*  Then yeah, I probably would have bumped into a few if I was there. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=130.24s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=133.24s)]
*  But I heard this beautiful out there, Shabuza, that's one of my close friends, and he was [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=134.24s)]
*  just out there shooting video. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=137.24s)]
*  He was like, bruh, I'm finna move out here. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=138.24s)]
*  It's crazy out here. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=139.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=140.24s)]
*  It's so nice out here. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=141.24s)]
*  I gotta make sure I stop by there for sure. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=142.24s)]
*  Yeah, it looks like you're on this planet, but on the best parts of it. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=144.72s)]
*  You look out there and they got all kinds of exotic animals, too, out there. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=150.24s)]
*  That's why I think, yeah, Native Americans have the best weed. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=154.16s)]
*  I've always heard that. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=157.04000000000002s)]
*  I've never gotten to smoke any with them. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=158.04000000000002s)]
*  They got that shit that'll bring your dead relatives back. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=160.0s)]
*  They got that real, they got that soothsayer gas on me. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=162.68s)]
*  Do I want to smoke that? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=167.60000000000002s)]
*  I'll get a point. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=168.60000000000002s)]
*  They'll bring your dead relatives back. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=169.60000000000002s)]
*  Do you want to smoke that? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=170.60000000000002s)]
*  That's true. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=171.60000000000002s)]
*  I guess if you owe somebody some money, maybe you just let them be where they're at. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=172.96s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=176.96s)]
*  And they had the best pets, too. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=177.96s)]
*  Think about it. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=179.48s)]
*  Native Americans had the best pets, man. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=180.48s)]
*  Falcon, buffalo, eagles. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=183.56s)]
*  I'm scared of all that type of stuff. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=187.68s)]
*  Really? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=189.92s)]
*  I'm scared of any animal that's for one, bigger than me. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=190.92s)]
*  Horses, cows, I'm terrified of them. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=193.35999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that makes sense. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=196.44s)]
*  Eagles and all that stuff, you can't really do nothing about those. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=198.28s)]
*  If they fly down and grab you and rip skin off, you can't do nothing to them. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=202.76s)]
*  I don't do bugs, I don't do exotic lizards, I don't do snakes. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=208.44s)]
*  Really? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=213.44s)]
*  I can see you with a nice bird, man. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=214.44s)]
*  With a bird? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=215.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=216.44s)]
*  I do have a bird. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=217.44s)]
*  My daughter's name. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=218.44s)]
*  Her nickname is Bird. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=219.44s)]
*  That's as good as it gets. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=220.44s)]
*  I was terrified right there. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=221.84s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=223.24s)]
*  Yeah, I was terrified. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=224.24s)]
*  You saw how far away I am from the horse? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=225.24s)]
*  Yeah, you kept your distance. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=228.04000000000002s)]
*  Did you even FaceTime with that thing first or they just brought him straight up? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=229.04000000000002s)]
*  They just brought it. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=233.8s)]
*  That kind of stuff is a lot, man. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=236.8s)]
*  Horses make me nervous too. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=238.72s)]
*  They're just so big and you don't trust them. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=239.72s)]
*  I don't trust anything that only can see out of the side of its head. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=242.56s)]
*  That too. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=245.56s)]
*  That too. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=246.56s)]
*  That's how I really feel about a lot of animals. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=247.56s)]
*  Did you ever have any pets growing up? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=250.08s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of dogs. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=252.24s)]
*  What kind do y'all have? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=255.32000000000002s)]
*  Rob Wallace. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=256.4s)]
*  Right now I have a Cane Corso. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=257.4s)]
*  I have two Pocket Bullies. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=258.4s)]
*  I have a Frenchie. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=261.4s)]
*  But yeah, yeah. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=262.4s)]
*  That actually looks just like my dog Sasha that's at the house right now with the white [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=265.4s)]
*  patches and everything. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=269.4s)]
*  And does y'all have a chain on it? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=270.4s)]
*  No. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=272.4s)]
*  No, she's horrible. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=273.4s)]
*  She's bad. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=274.4s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=275.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=276.4s)]
*  Can you even pet her or nothing? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=277.4s)]
*  Yeah, you can pet her or whatnot, but if she doesn't know you, she's going to go crazy. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=278.4s)]
*  Oh, God. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=281.4s)]
*  But once she's smitten you and she's good and you're locked in. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=282.4s)]
*  I wouldn't even risk it. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=285.47999999999996s)]
*  See, I get scared getting high around dangerous animals. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=287.47999999999996s)]
*  That's one of my big things. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=290.47999999999996s)]
*  You know, I would have sometimes trouble smoking with the brothers when I was young because [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=292.47999999999996s)]
*  a lot of them would bring a dog with them. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=296.47999999999996s)]
*  And if we got high, it just made me too nervous. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=299.47999999999996s)]
*  Man, I had to get out of my own car and leave everybody in there one time because I couldn't [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=302.47999999999996s)]
*  handle it. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=306.47999999999996s)]
*  Well, you might want to stay away from that weed in my town. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=307.47999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=310.47999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I stay off that native stuff, man. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=312.47999999999996s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us, bro. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=314.56s)]
*  No, for sure. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=316.56s)]
*  It's a blessing to be here. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=317.56s)]
*  Yeah, congratulations on all your success, man. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=318.56s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=320.56s)]
*  It's exciting. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=321.56s)]
*  Yeah, I love listening to your songs. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=322.56s)]
*  They all have this beginning that kind of creates this like, it almost feels like it's [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=325.56s)]
*  a start of a movie. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=330.56s)]
*  It's like before you come in with the lyrics, it's like there's this, each one has like [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=331.56s)]
*  this ambiance that gets going. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=338.56s)]
*  Who makes that? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=340.56s)]
*  How do y'all make that choice? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=341.56s)]
*  How does that happen? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=342.64s)]
*  I've been with the same producers for about two, three years now, Ben Play, Tony Coase, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=343.64s)]
*  and so we kind of just know each other's souls at this point. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=350.64s)]
*  And so they just, you know, they go based off of what they feel like I would miss within [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=355.64s)]
*  a song and then they go from there. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=361.64s)]
*  Tony pick out the sample, Ben Play do the 808 side of the beatin' on it and then they [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=363.64s)]
*  just go. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=368.64s)]
*  They know I like, I'm a build up person. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=369.71999999999997s)]
*  So that beginning, that's my build up. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=372.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it almost feels kind of romantic in the beginning. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=374.71999999999997s)]
*  I know for sure. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=377.71999999999997s)]
*  It gets you in the mood, gets you ready. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=378.71999999999997s)]
*  It makes you want to hear what I'm about to say. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=379.71999999999997s)]
*  The video with the skydiving, did y'all really skydive in it? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=382.71999999999997s)]
*  No, I would never skydive in my life. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=386.71999999999997s)]
*  Really? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=388.71999999999997s)]
*  Oh, you'd go down quick. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=389.71999999999997s)]
*  Skydive, bungee jump. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=390.71999999999997s)]
*  I'm one of those people who believe in like, I just feel like I would have a heart attack [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=393.71999999999997s)]
*  before I got, you know, I was fainting or something so now I can't pull my string. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=398.8s)]
*  So I'd just rather not do it. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=403.8s)]
*  I'd just rather not do it. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=404.8s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=405.8s)]
*  I don't know why some people do it. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=406.8s)]
*  I wonder if they have a lot of, yeah, the video, that was so tough, man. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=409.8s)]
*  How did y'all shoot it though? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=412.8s)]
*  Did you guys have like a fake chopper or something? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=413.8s)]
*  A fake plane, a lot of air, and great actor. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=415.8s)]
*  Anybody want me in the movie? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=420.8s)]
*  There you go. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=422.8s)]
*  Yeah, you could be in like a paratrooper movie, man. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=423.8s)]
*  For sure. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=426.8s)]
*  It doesn't look like I fell that fast. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=427.88s)]
*  It actually looks like I fell at a decent rate. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=429.88s)]
*  There you go, there it went. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=431.88s)]
*  I would drop fast right there. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=432.88s)]
*  It did seem like you were, because I was kind of, when I was watching Matt, because usually [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=434.88s)]
*  if people are really flying, you see like the cheeks going like that, and I was like, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=437.88s)]
*  man, it seemed like he's kind of going at a casual speed. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=440.88s)]
*  But that's when you know you got, when you got a vibe, bro, when you can skydive at a [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=444.88s)]
*  casual speed. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=448.88s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=449.88s)]
*  When you can do it your own way. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=450.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=452.88s)]
*  What's happening in Texas, man? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=453.88s)]
*  Still hot. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=456.96s)]
*  How has your life changed over there? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=461.96s)]
*  Like even in the past two years, probably. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=463.96s)]
*  I mean, for me, it hasn't really changed. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=466.96s)]
*  I still do the same daily stuff I would do if I was home. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=469.96s)]
*  But of course, everybody know me now, so now instead of going to Walmart, I now have to [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=472.96s)]
*  do curbside pickups, and now, you know, it's just stuff like that. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=478.96s)]
*  But as far as me and my home and my family, ain't nothing really changed. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=482.03999999999996s)]
*  We still, everybody kick it when we can. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=487.03999999999996s)]
*  You know, if not, I'm at home with my kids, chilling, you know, nothing too major. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=490.03999999999996s)]
*  I don't, I'm as basic as a geek. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=494.03999999999996s)]
*  I don't, you know, treat myself like a superstar or nothing like that. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=497.03999999999996s)]
*  So. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=500.03999999999996s)]
*  Is it, does it feel overwhelming sometimes with people knowing you as much? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=501.03999999999996s)]
*  Is it sometimes a little bit like, what is it like? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=504.03999999999996s)]
*  Does it feel kind of like alarming sometimes? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=507.03999999999996s)]
*  Does it feel like what you thought it would feel like? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=510.12s)]
*  Because a lot of people don't get to have that much popularity, right? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=513.12s)]
*  So it's interesting when it does happen to somebody because it's just a rare thing. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=517.12s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, as far as like, I was popular in school, but then it's like after that era [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=521.12s)]
*  faded out, I started doing stuff that it's like, you kind of don't want people to know [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=528.12s)]
*  who you are. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=532.12s)]
*  And now it's like, I got to let people get this close to me before I know if they're [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=535.12s)]
*  friends or foes. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=539.2s)]
*  So of course it bothers me, but I mean, they come with the, come with the job. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=540.2s)]
*  So I just got to keep big guys like him around me. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=544.2s)]
*  So. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=547.2s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=548.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=549.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=550.2s)]
*  That's a good choice there. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=551.2s)]
*  And, and yeah, is it more dangerous? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=552.2s)]
*  Because I think like, it's funny. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=555.2s)]
*  Sometimes if you're just like a regular guy, nobody will try to shoot you. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=557.2s)]
*  But then when you're a rapper, people try to shoot you. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=560.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=563.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=564.2s)]
*  You definitely. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=565.2s)]
*  It's just a lot of, you know, just like it's God in the world. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=566.2800000000001s)]
*  It's devil, you know, it's the devil too, man. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=571.2800000000001s)]
*  You know, the paths that some people decide to take is not always the right one. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=573.2800000000001s)]
*  So, you know, you just got to kind of be prepared for it. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=578.2800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you're a target because everybody feel like you got all this money, all of this, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=581.2800000000001s)]
*  people don't even know. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=586.2800000000001s)]
*  Like, so a lot of these major artists, all they have is that chain and that watch. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=587.2800000000001s)]
*  I got no money, you know, so you just did what you did for the chain and watch. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=592.36s)]
*  Me, I try to treat everybody as equals. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=596.36s)]
*  So like when a person walk up on me, I'm going to give you that picture. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=598.36s)]
*  I'm going to talk to you as if you're a normal person because that's what makes somebody [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=601.36s)]
*  want to get you when you know I'm good. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=604.36s)]
*  You know, that's what set when you, when you showed them that separation. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=607.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=611.36s)]
*  That's when they want what you got. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=612.36s)]
*  When you're too fancy. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=613.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=614.36s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=615.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=616.36s)]
*  For rappers, it just feels like it just feels a little bit more dangerous. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=617.36s)]
*  I feel like, you know, like, do you have to keep like, you know, like, you know, like, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=619.36s)]
*  you know, like, do you have to keep like a EMT with like, like, do your people know [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=620.44s)]
*  CPR and your team and stuff like that? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=626.44s)]
*  Or what is it like? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=628.44s)]
*  I ain't gonna lie, fellas. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=629.44s)]
*  If I have, if we get to that point, don't try to put your lips on me. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=632.44s)]
*  Don't try to put your lips on me. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=636.44s)]
*  Y'all find the nearest woman and y'all teach her how to do it, but don't try to put your [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=639.44s)]
*  lips on me. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=644.44s)]
*  You have some girls sitting there watching a YouTube video. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=645.44s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=647.44s)]
*  I can't, no, I can't go through that. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=648.44s)]
*  I can't go through that. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=649.5200000000001s)]
*  So, bro, you ain't gonna feel it, bro. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=650.5200000000001s)]
*  You gonna be just. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=652.5200000000001s)]
*  But when I come to, that's a question you gotta ask. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=653.5200000000001s)]
*  You know, when you come to and you say what happened, so there's a, there's gonna be [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=655.5200000000001s)]
*  that guy that's in the back of the room like, you know, and I don't wanna deal with that. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=660.5200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=665.5200000000001s)]
*  You don't have to look him in the eye. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=666.5200000000001s)]
*  You got, you have to. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=667.5200000000001s)]
*  You don't know, you don't know whether to say thank you or let's fight. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=668.5200000000001s)]
*  You know? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=671.5200000000001s)]
*  Hey, chill, bro. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=672.5200000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=673.5200000000001s)]
*  Hey, next time, ask first. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=674.5200000000001s)]
*  My partner's so funny that they ain't gonna do nothing but make a joke about it. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=675.6s)]
*  I almost died and y'all talking about some, but y'all kissed though. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=680.6s)]
*  Y'all kissed. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=684.6s)]
*  You know, so. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=685.6s)]
*  You alive, but you a little zesty now. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=686.6s)]
*  Just find the nearest woman. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=688.6s)]
*  Find the nearest woman for me. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=689.6s)]
*  I don't care how old she is. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=690.6s)]
*  Just find the nearest woman, please. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=692.6s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I just wonder. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=695.6s)]
*  I think I would keep, if I was in the rap, I would have somebody bowing arrows, somebody [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=697.6s)]
*  with a couple choppers on them, everything. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=702.6800000000001s)]
*  Dracos, everything. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=705.6800000000001s)]
*  Guns, fucking. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=707.6800000000001s)]
*  The little ninja things. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=708.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I would have, bro. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=711.6800000000001s)]
*  Magic metal, fucking ninja stars, all of that shit. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=713.6800000000001s)]
*  I mean, you just pray for the best. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=716.6800000000001s)]
*  Axe, I would have everything, bro. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=719.6800000000001s)]
*  I'd have somebody just walking around, look like they're in one of those video games where [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=721.6800000000001s)]
*  they have all the weapons behind them like that. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=724.6800000000001s)]
*  Like when they get ready to go to war, they pack all of the weapons, but then they don't [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=726.6800000000001s)]
*  use none of them. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=729.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=730.6800000000001s)]
*  I know, I know. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=731.76s)]
*  Even cops now, they got so many things on them. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=732.76s)]
*  They got a taser, they got a gun, they got a sling shot, they got a pepper spray, they [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=734.76s)]
*  got a fucking thing of marbles. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=741.76s)]
*  They got all kinds of shit on them, bro. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=743.76s)]
*  You'll see they got a... [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=745.76s)]
*  I've never seen an officer with a bag of marbles. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=746.76s)]
*  But they got so many things now, bro. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=748.76s)]
*  He got a camera, they got a little spatula, a thing of just breath mints. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=750.76s)]
*  He's just shooting Mentos at people. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=756.76s)]
*  I couldn't even imagine running around with all that stuff on me now. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=758.84s)]
*  Yeah, they do. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=763.84s)]
*  They got to chase people there. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=764.84s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=766.84s)]
*  On top of the vest. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=767.84s)]
*  Yeah, they built like a 7-Eleven and they got to run around and chase everybody down. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=769.84s)]
*  That's too much. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=773.84s)]
*  Everybody would get away from me if I was police. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=774.84s)]
*  I'll catch you eventually. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=776.84s)]
*  Hey, I'll catch you in the future. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=778.84s)]
*  Yeah, let me see you again. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=780.84s)]
*  Because I couldn't. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=781.84s)]
*  What was like a first job that you had, man? [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=783.84s)]
*  My first ever job was Taco Cabamba. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=787.9200000000001s)]
*  I was 16. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=789.9200000000001s)]
*  I was supposed to get paid $7.25. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=791.9200000000001s)]
*  But when I started working, my first day he said, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=795.9200000000001s)]
*  $7.25? No, you're too good of a worker. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=797.9200000000001s)]
*  I'll pay you $7.50. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=800.9200000000001s)]
*  Really? [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=801.9200000000001s)]
*  And I just thought I was that guy. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=802.9200000000001s)]
*  $7.50? Woo! [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=804.9200000000001s)]
*  That was my first ever check. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=806.9200000000001s)]
*  My first check was like $200, two weeks work. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=808.9200000000001s)]
*  Bro, when you got that first check, it was nice, huh? [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=810.9200000000001s)]
*  No, I was so upset. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=813.9200000000001s)]
*  It was like $200, $300. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=814.9200000000001s)]
*  Oh. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=817.0s)]
*  Two weeks of work. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=818.0s)]
*  Yeah, I was so mad. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=819.0s)]
*  But I kept going. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=820.0s)]
*  I kept going. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=822.0s)]
*  And how long were you in over there at the Cabana? [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=823.0s)]
*  Maybe like a month, maybe a month and a half. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=826.0s)]
*  Damn, you didn't keep going at all, man. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=828.0s)]
*  I've never had a job over four or five months. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=830.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=834.0s)]
*  What was it about, you think? [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=835.0s)]
*  Did y'all have some, like, was it contractual issues? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=836.0s)]
*  What was the deal over there? [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=838.0s)]
*  As bad as it sounds, it's just something about somebody telling me what to do. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=840.0s)]
*  I'm saying especially in that aspect, it's like, you're not even the big dog. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=846.08s)]
*  You work for them just like I work for them, and you sitting there telling me what to do. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=851.08s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=855.08s)]
*  I just always felt like, I watched my mom and my pops growing up. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=856.08s)]
*  They were entrepreneurs, so they was their own bosses. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=860.08s)]
*  And here I am working at Taco Cabana getting paid $7.50 when I would rather be my own boss. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=863.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=869.08s)]
*  So I think that's probably, me having that first job is probably what made me start wanting [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=870.08s)]
*  to do stuff to just be my own entity, my own boss, because that was horrible. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=875.1600000000001s)]
*  Having somebody telling you when to come in, telling you what to do at the job, I just, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=880.1600000000001s)]
*  I couldn't do it. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=886.1600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=887.1600000000001s)]
*  I couldn't do it. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=888.1600000000001s)]
*  And was any of the food pretty good, or was it like? [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=889.1600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, they used to have this little, I don't even know what the bowl was called, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=891.1600000000001s)]
*  but it's like a bowl shell. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=895.1600000000001s)]
*  It's a bowl, but it's just like the bowl is a shell. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=896.1600000000001s)]
*  And inside of that you got like your meats, your guacamole, your rice, beans. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=900.24s)]
*  I like all of that. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=906.24s)]
*  You can just crush the bowl. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=907.24s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=909.24s)]
*  Hey, whoever's doing that is doing a great job. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=910.24s)]
*  Oh, we about to pay that dude $7.50 an hour, I'll tell you that. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=913.24s)]
*  A Cabela. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=916.24s)]
*  We keeping him. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=917.24s)]
*  Get a new job. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=919.24s)]
*  Get a new job. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=920.24s)]
*  By that Cabela bowl. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=921.24s)]
*  God, that does look good. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=922.24s)]
*  That's like a little magic hat or something filled with a down, a little Thanksgiving [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=923.24s)]
*  and a little Mexican Thanksgiving in there. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=926.24s)]
*  That was my, every time I would leave work that's what I was taking with me. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=928.32s)]
*  Cabela bowl. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=932.32s)]
*  And what y'all had dessert choices up there too? [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=933.32s)]
*  Soapapillas. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=936.32s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=937.32s)]
*  Soapapillas. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=938.32s)]
*  With ice cream with them? [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=939.32s)]
*  Not ice cream, but like some little ice in the head. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=940.32s)]
*  I love those. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=943.32s)]
*  Yeah, soapapillas. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=944.32s)]
*  That was my first time ever having a soapapilla was at that job. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=945.32s)]
*  It ain't my favorite thing to make there. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=949.32s)]
*  You just got to drop in some grease, come out like the little perfect little square [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=951.32s)]
*  thing, dip it in the sauce. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=955.32s)]
*  That's good. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=957.4000000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=958.4000000000001s)]
*  And y'all could smoke on the job. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=959.4000000000001s)]
*  Was that allowed or not? [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=961.4000000000001s)]
*  No. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=962.4000000000001s)]
*  I was a football player at that time so I wasn't really just smoking. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=963.4000000000001s)]
*  I was on the hoes, some old other stuff. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=966.4000000000001s)]
*  See whenever I had jobs is when I was kind of like on a different path. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=970.4000000000001s)]
*  Whenever I didn't have a job it was a different path. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=975.4000000000001s)]
*  I was trying to be my own boss at that time. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=978.4000000000001s)]
*  What was, you said one of your folks, they had their own business. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=981.4000000000001s)]
*  What was their business they had? [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=984.48s)]

*  She came, I think she slept on the couch with me maybe two, three weeks. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1311.36s)]
*  And then I had this apartment. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1316.36s)]
*  It wasn't no furniture. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1317.36s)]
*  The first week or two. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1318.36s)]

*  You know what, no, I think about it though. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1363.4399999999998s)]
*  I was in solitary confinement though for that Thanksgiving. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1364.4399999999998s)]
*  So boom. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1365.4399999999998s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1366.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I was. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1367.4399999999998s)]
*  I was. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1368.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I was. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1369.4399999999998s)]
*  So it was just a fun time. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1370.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1371.4399999999998s)]
*  And then we got to go to the next one. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1372.4399999999998s)]
*  I'm gonna go to the next one. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1373.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1374.4399999999998s)]
*  I'm gonna go to the next one. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1375.4399999999998s)]
*  I'm gonna go to the next one. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1376.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1377.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I was. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1378.52s)]
*  So it was just a bunch of screaming from door to door. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1379.52s)]
*  Would you just hear people's voices? [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1383.8s)]
*  Do people at least sing like a? [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1384.8s)]
*  I mean you got, there's people that sit there that's actually crazy, you know what I'm saying? [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1387.68s)]
*  So they actually do scream and do all that stuff. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1391.24s)]
*  But do they scream anything special like because it's Thanksgiving? [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1394.2s)]
*  That's what I'm wondering. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1396.68s)]
*  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1397.68s)]
*  I was screaming something special on the day I got out. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1398.68s)]
*  It was a Tuesday. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1401.88s)]
*  Like the day I was supposed to go to court, it was a Tuesday. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1402.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1405.04s)]
*  I woke up to take my shower. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1406.6399999999999s)]
*  I was singing Tuesday, Tuesday. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1407.6399999999999s)]
*  Like if you ever seen Norbit, he was in the shower knowing that he had to go to the waterpark [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1408.6399999999999s)]
*  with all the girls on a Tuesday. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1416.56s)]
*  That's exactly how it was. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1418.48s)]
*  And everybody that was in that room was just dying laughing. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1419.48s)]

*  Were you in there? [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1427.3999999999999s)]
*  No. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1428.3999999999999s)]
*  No, Halloween I was out. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1429.3999999999999s)]
*  Thanksgiving, yeah. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1430.3999999999999s)]

*  I mean, yeah, they give you a little scoop of dressing and that, but it's just not the [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1434.52s)]
*  same as. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1439.32s)]
*  Do y'all go around the table and like say what you're thankful for or anything like [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1440.32s)]
*  that? [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1442.96s)]
*  Nah, I doubt that's how it went. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1443.96s)]
*  You see the egga? [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1445.8s)]
*  Aw. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1446.8s)]
*  Who are those guys? [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1447.8s)]
*  I don't know them. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1448.8s)]
*  Oh. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1449.8s)]
*  I don't know them. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1450.8s)]
*  Yeah, look, I mean, it definitely, yeah, it seems, yeah, I guess it wouldn't be the [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1451.8s)]
*  best, like it wouldn't be the best. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1458.12s)]
*  Like really holidays, holidays in jail, I feel like they're not really celebrated because [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1460.44s)]
*  that's the time where everybody wishes that they was with their family, you know what [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1466.0s)]
*  I'm saying? [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1469.8s)]
*  So that's when everybody, it's kind of intense because everybody is upset. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1470.8s)]
*  Everybody want to be with their kids, their moms, you know what I'm saying? [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1473.96s)]
*  So everybody just kind of try to get through the day. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1477.04s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good point. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1479.8400000000001s)]
*  I've never thought about that. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1480.8400000000001s)]
*  You kind of almost pretend like it's not that day. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1481.8400000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1483.92s)]
*  Did they have like a lot of gay activity in jail? [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1484.92s)]
*  Did you see any of it? [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1486.8400000000001s)]
*  Or you hear about it sometimes on the internet? [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1487.8400000000001s)]
*  It was one gay experience for me in jail and there was an older dude that had, he was [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1489.04s)]
*  in there from stealing a bunch of wood from Home Depot. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1494.3999999999999s)]
*  Damn. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1498.48s)]
*  Probably going to build him a little gay hut. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1499.48s)]
*  I don't know, but he had been in there. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1501.2s)]
*  A little zest shack. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1503.2s)]
*  He had been in there. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1504.2s)]
*  I don't think nobody knew that he was like that or whatever, but you could tell he had [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1505.2s)]
*  been there a lot. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1508.36s)]
*  He had, he done went to jail a bunch of times. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1509.36s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1510.84s)]
*  There was a guy that came in there that was a dentist, but he was a member of the LGBTQ [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1512.84s)]
*  community. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1520.84s)]
*  Okay. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1521.84s)]
*  And he came in with nothing. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1522.84s)]
*  Like he was from, this is right when- [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1524.84s)]
*  He was a dentist? [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1526.76s)]
*  Yeah, but he was an illegal dentist. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1527.76s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1529.76s)]
*  So he knew how to do teeth, but he didn't have- [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1530.76s)]
*  He didn't have a storefront. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1532.6s)]
*  Or the paperwork or anything. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1534.08s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1535.56s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1536.56s)]
*  He just knew how to do. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1537.56s)]
*  But he was from Mexico. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1538.56s)]
*  This is when they were, this is when the whole ICE situation was going on and they [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1539.56s)]
*  were catching a bunch of the illegals and sending them back. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1543.6799999999998s)]
*  And so my pa was a bunch of illegals and he was one of the illegals, but he just happened [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1548.48s)]
*  to be a part of the HB, you know what I'm saying? [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1554.0s)]
*  He was a gay gentleman, but he also did dental. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1555.96s)]
*  He did dental. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1559.08s)]
*  And he would do dental in the- [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1560.08s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1561.08s)]
*  That's how he got arrested. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1562.08s)]
*  When he got pulled over, he had a bunch of dentist equipment and dentist stuff in his [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1563.08s)]
*  trunk and he just, there was no license. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1566.84s)]
*  Wow. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1570.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1571.04s)]
*  So that's what got him. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1572.04s)]
*  But then on top of that, like I said, he was illegal. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1573.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1576.36s)]
*  So, but yeah, he didn't have nothing. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1577.36s)]
*  And the old G, the old school, he had some stuff. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1580.36s)]
*  And so he just basically took care of him and he had to take care of him. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1584.56s)]
*  So it was just kind of like a prison, kind of a love story almost. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1588.84s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1591.68s)]
*  And we weren't even in prison. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1592.68s)]
*  We was just in jail. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1593.68s)]
*  But that, yeah, that kind of messed me up. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1594.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1596.8s)]
*  That messed me up. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1597.8s)]
*  Yes or no, but even then, at least you get to see somebody having some romance, I guess [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1598.8s)]
*  that was almost- [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1602.3600000000001s)]
*  I didn't see anything. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1603.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1604.3600000000001s)]
*  Or you get to, or I guess it's, yeah, I don't know. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1605.3600000000001s)]
*  I didn't see anything. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1608.48s)]
*  I just, you know, you kind of put two and two together. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1609.48s)]
*  But you start to put two and two together. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1610.48s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1611.48s)]
*  But I bet some people get a little bit envious, like, at least he got somebody, you know? [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1612.48s)]
*  I mean, hey, I don't know. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1617.2s)]
*  I didn't think that way. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1619.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1620.6000000000001s)]
*  I just, you know, kind of- [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1621.6000000000001s)]
*  Me neither, dude. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1622.6000000000001s)]
*  I just kind of- [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1623.6000000000001s)]
*  That's love is love, though. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1625.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1626.52s)]
*  If people are in for a long time. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1627.52s)]
*  I could see how if somebody's in for a long time and they're not going to get out, they [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1628.9199999999998s)]
*  say, I'm just going to have to figure this out over here and call. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1633.52s)]
*  I mean, if you in jail, if you're in prison for the rest of your life, no, I can't even [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1636.7199999999998s)]
*  say that because then that is a situation if I was to ever go to prison for the rest [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1643.3999999999999s)]
*  of my life. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1646.76s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, so I don't know. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1647.76s)]
*  We're here now. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1649.9599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1650.9599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1651.9599999999998s)]
*  Happy Thanksgiving. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1652.9599999999998s)]
*  Wow, man. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1654.32s)]
*  Yeah, I guess I wonder what the holidays are like in there and stuff like that, but is [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1655.32s)]
*  there anything that you miss? [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1659.48s)]
*  Wait, what's the difference between jail and prison? [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1660.48s)]
*  I've never been to prison, so I can't really tell you how bad prison get, but from what [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1663.3600000000001s)]
*  I've heard, it's just, I mean, you got to, it's, see, jail, you possibly going home, [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1668.48s)]
*  you know what I'm saying? [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1675.0s)]
*  Like, you can go home. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1676.0s)]
*  Prison, you know, you're there for a little bit, so that's when it's more hostile, it's [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1677.0s)]
*  more gangs, it's more, you know what I'm saying? [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1683.4s)]
*  That's where that stuff takes a play in, like the gang wars and the racial stuff. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1686.44s)]
*  That stuff is real in prison. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1693.3200000000002s)]
*  I hate all that. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1694.6000000000001s)]
*  Some people say that the feds is better than prison just because of the strength. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1695.6000000000001s)]
*  It's for one, I guess a lot more people with money there, so, and there's just a lot more [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1700.0400000000002s)]
*  stuff there like tablets, you know what I mean? [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1703.72s)]
*  Everybody got tablets now, even in prison, they got tablets. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1707.48s)]
*  Yeah, but it's just, you know what I'm saying, for a while. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1710.2800000000002s)]
*  You know, things with recess type shit, outdoor stuff. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1712.36s)]
*  I have never been to prison, I've never been to the feds, so I don't know, I'm just going [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1714.84s)]
*  off of what I've been told, but I know if jail's sucked, prison got to be worse and [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1718.36s)]
*  the feds got to be worse than that. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1725.8s)]
*  Damn. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1727.6399999999999s)]
*  You know, so it's just like, but if I ever go there and do some time, I'd rather go to [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1728.6399999999999s)]
*  the feds because they just look like they're not free, but they're freer, you know what [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1731.8s)]
*  I'm saying? [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1736.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, a little more relaxed. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1737.6399999999999s)]
*  Exactly, exactly. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1738.6399999999999s)]
*  I don't know if I'm going to ever go to prison or not. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1739.96s)]
*  I mean, you know, overall, I would probably, I would hope I didn't, but don't fucking try [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1742.76s)]
*  me. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1747.48s)]
*  Yeah, no, for sure. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1748.48s)]
*  So that's how I think about some of that. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1749.48s)]
*  They say first impressions are important. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1752.2800000000002s)]
*  What about lasting impressions? [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1755.0400000000002s)]

*  I kind of told a story because here I am here and he's in Texas, you know what I'm saying? [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1957.28s)]
*  But this is me doing what I got to do to benefit him. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1961.8400000000001s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1964.8400000000001s)]
*  So but yeah, yeah. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1965.8400000000001s)]
*  So I got out, made the promises to him. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1968.8400000000001s)]
*  And so I just had to figure it out. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1971.8400000000001s)]
*  I had a, he's not my artist, but he's also my cousin. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1973.48s)]
*  He was just a good friend at the time. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1977.0400000000002s)]
*  He just was like, he'd been rapping since he was nine years old. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1978.8400000000001s)]
*  He's your real cousin? [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1982.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1983.2s)]
*  Okay. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1984.2s)]
*  So whenever you need to rap, you need to rap because we would do like little freestyle [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1985.24s)]
*  sessions and whatnot and I would freestyle and it'll be a group of us. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1988.64s)]
*  But he would just look at me and be like, bro, you need to rap for real. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1992.92s)]
*  But I'm like, bro, you've been rapping since you was nine years old and you ain't blew [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1996.76s)]
*  up yet. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=1999.24s)]
*  Why would I do that? [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2000.24s)]
*  You know? [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2001.24s)]
*  I'm not going to listen to you. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2002.24s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2003.24s)]
*  But whenever I got out and I just really didn't have nothing else, you know what I'm saying? [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2004.24s)]
*  Like what I was saying about, I was really trying to live up to that promise that I made [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2007.96s)]
*  to my son. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2011.28s)]
*  Whenever he was like rap, I was like, all right, I bet. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2012.68s)]
*  I tried it, maybe like three songs. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2016.08s)]
*  I liked the feedback I got from, you know what I'm saying? [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2018.32s)]
*  Just from our friend group and it went past that to just people that we knew from school. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2023.2s)]
*  Then it went from that to people that we didn't know. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2028.2s)]
*  And so I was just like, okay, just doing something. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2031.2s)]
*  So you just gave it to friends first. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2034.08s)]
*  Was it even like close friends or do you have like enough confidence? [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2035.6s)]
*  You're like, all right, I'm going to put this, I'm going to. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2038.04s)]
*  I mean, of course, I just I didn't even know how to drop music. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2040.6399999999999s)]
*  Ro told me Distro Kid. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2043.6399999999999s)]
*  So I just went through Distro Kid. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2045.36s)]
*  But like I said, when I was dropping the music, I was just telling my immediate friend group. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2047.48s)]
*  But then when I started noticing that I was getting tags and stuff from people that I [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2053.6s)]
*  didn't know. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2057.7999999999997s)]
*  That's wild. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2058.7999999999997s)]
*  I was like, okay, this is doing a little something. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2059.7999999999997s)]
*  It's doing a little something. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2061.36s)]
*  Then just to walk around my own city and everybody know me. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2062.8399999999997s)]
*  I go in any club, everybody knew me. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2065.56s)]
*  I was like, all right, you. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2067.56s)]
*  This is really, it's really crazy. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2069.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2072.08s)]
*  Then I got my first I got my first deal in like in six months. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2073.08s)]
*  My first distribution deal under six months. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2076.68s)]
*  So once that happened, I just went from there. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2079.7999999999997s)]
*  I just I had made a little bag off of it because I didn't I didn't touch a lot of money in [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2082.3199999999997s)]
*  my life, but I never touched nothing. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2086.84s)]
*  I've never had a hundred thousand dollars sitting in my hand at one point in time. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2089.64s)]
*  And when I did that distribution deal, I had that. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2093.56s)]
*  So I was like, me doing something non illegal, I just had a hundred thousand dollars at one [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2096.52s)]
*  time. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2103.04s)]
*  You must have been like, dang, this is it. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2104.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2106.56s)]
*  And then like three months later, I was broke. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2107.56s)]
*  Would you get a water slot or something? [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2109.64s)]
*  No, I just was, you know, doing for everybody. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2113.08s)]
*  Everybody bought some wild shit when they get a little bit of money. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2117.96s)]
*  Now, they'll tell you, I didn't even I have no big chains. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2119.88s)]
*  I didn't even want no chain to this day. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2122.08s)]
*  I wouldn't have this chain if they wouldn't tell me, bro, you got an image that you got [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2123.8s)]
*  to uphold. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2127.8s)]

*  You can't. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2129.8s)]
*  I don't I never cared about none of that at first. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2130.8s)]
*  I kind of got addicted after I start paying for it. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2133.0400000000004s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2135.7200000000003s)]
*  You get some nice carpet or whatever. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2136.7200000000003s)]
*  You get a rug, nice table. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2138.0800000000004s)]
*  You start buying all kind of shit lamps, silverware with your name on it. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2139.5600000000004s)]

*  But now, yeah. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2146.6800000000003s)]
*  So I had the smallest chains I just was doing for people around me. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2148.2400000000002s)]
*  I go in the mall. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2151.2400000000002s)]
*  I couldn't even find nothing for me to wear in the mall. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2153.56s)]
*  I would go to the mall to buy shoes and just tell my friends, hey, I'll give you whatever [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2155.72s)]
*  I want. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2160.0s)]
*  Oh, that's good. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2161.0s)]
*  Like my mama, anytime she would ask for anything, giving it to my pops, anything, I was just [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2162.0s)]
*  doing it. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2166.68s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2167.68s)]
*  Then I looked up one day and I was down to like twenty five thousand dollars. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2168.68s)]
*  I was like, oh shit. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2172.6s)]
*  It was fast, too. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2173.6s)]
*  And you got to pay taxes. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2174.6s)]
*  You don't even think about that. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2175.6s)]
*  And I didn't think about none of that. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2176.6s)]
*  I didn't think about none of that. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2177.6s)]
*  And so I just had to I really just put my foot down and grind it. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2178.6s)]
*  And I got it all back. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2179.6s)]

*  if, if, if the world was to end, you know how like in all the world, in the movies, [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2314.52s)]
*  there's always like those two ships or two boats. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2319.04s)]
*  I think I've made it to get on one of those now. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2323.16s)]
*  Like I'm on the list. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2326.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2327.3599999999997s)]

*  So, and you have to bring your children probably. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2331.0s)]
*  Yeah, obviously, obviously. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2333.4s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2342.7999999999997s)]
*  One kid, one woman and the other kid. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2344.44s)]
*  I gotta take both my kids. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2348.48s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2351.96s)]
*  That's the best answer to end on, I think for that. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2352.16s)]
*  Um, yeah, people bet on it now. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2355.04s)]

*  created relationships with yet. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2439.16s)]
*  Uh, I keep my head down. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2441.2799999999997s)]

*  And a lot of this stuff is not genuine. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2469.6800000000003s)]
*  You know, I just, I just kind of stay to myself. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2471.44s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2476.44s)]

*  Like, so you don't need, I guess, an industry, you don't, yeah, maybe [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2503.4s)]
*  you're your own mentor. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2509.04s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2510.0s)]
*  Your son could be your mentor in a way, because it really is a mentor is just [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2510.64s)]
*  kind of a source of inspiration kind of. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2513.92s)]
*  No, for sure. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2515.3199999999997s)]
*  Cause these days I don't want to get up and I don't want to do none of this. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2515.68s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2518.3199999999997s)]

*  stuff in this industry and he, him and Ellie Choppa, um, it's just, as far [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2594.72s)]
*  as rappers, that's really, you know, just it, but like they, they were most [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2602.88s)]

*  he was going, whenever he transitioned to that, if I was a bad, like he, he [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2613.56s)]
*  was on the way to go to Rolling Loud. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2618.76s)]
*  Cause you know, the first time he performed, it was at a Rolling Loud. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2620.6800000000003s)]
*  I had just left Rolling Loud. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2623.2000000000003s)]
*  So we had the same hotel. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2624.44s)]
*  We had already done a song before then, but, uh, we was chopping it up and in [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2626.28s)]
*  the back you could hear the song playing. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2630.6800000000003s)]
*  Like he had somebody in the back specifically holding a speaker to play [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2632.0s)]
*  that song and, um, you know, a lot of people just didn't really understand [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2635.76s)]
*  what he had going and they didn't see where, I didn't, I didn't even see the [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2640.24s)]
*  vision, but I just knew, you know what I'm saying? [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2643.32s)]
*  At the end of the day, as long as you comfortable with doing what you're [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2646.2s)]
*  doing and you know your, your reasons behind doing what you're doing and why [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2649.0s)]
*  not do it, like you, you're young. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2651.76s)]

*  Why you can't do it. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2657.48s)]
*  And so he just basically thanked me the other day for just, you know, [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2658.92s)]
*  basically accepting, you know what I'm saying? [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2662.04s)]
*  What he had going, basically believing in what he had going. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2663.88s)]
*  And now that's like I said, that's my guy, man. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2666.12s)]
*  I got to get him on. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2668.76s)]
*  He just reached out and said, thank you. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2669.4s)]
*  Yeah, I was getting my haircut at my house. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2670.6s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2681.2s)]
*  It was broad daylight where he was and I, it was dark where I was, you know what I'm [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2681.36s)]
*  saying? [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2684.24s)]
*  He was just calling me heads. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2684.48s)]
*  He got the shower. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2685.56s)]
*  He was like, yeah, man, I just want to let you know, I appreciate you. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2686.72s)]
*  I thank you. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2688.64s)]
*  But yeah, Shaboos, that's my dog. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2689.84s)]
*  I was just with him in New York. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2690.96s)]
*  I was trying to bring him out to the show today, but he in LA now. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2692.44s)]
*  So he's all over. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2695.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2696.88s)]
*  We sat next to each other at a game. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2697.0s)]
*  It was pretty good. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2698.4s)]
*  Watching the Vegas Aces is good, man. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2699.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2701.4s)]
*  I got to go see, I got to go see a women's basketball game. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2701.84s)]
*  I feel like it's more intense. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2704.2400000000002s)]
*  I can relate to their games because I can't dunk. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2706.4s)]
*  They can't dunk. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2708.7200000000003s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2709.48s)]
*  I feel that. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2710.7200000000003s)]
*  So every time they trying to dunk and they can, I, that's right. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2711.12s)]
*  You feel it. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2714.48s)]

*  I'm like, I got, I know what these women are going through. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2716.76s)]
*  I actually can't dunk. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2718.96s)]
*  My manager just didn't give footage of it. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2720.72s)]
*  Really? [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2722.48s)]

*  Druski wrote it. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2877.28s)]
*  Okay. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2878.28s)]
*  So we're at the one of them, the dad dies. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2879.04s)]
*  It's Druski and his sister. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2883.4s)]
*  They own, they're inherent in a funeral parlor and then I'm married to Druski's [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2884.76s)]
*  sister and so I'm getting part of the funeral parlor. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2888.6s)]
*  Okay. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2892.48s)]
*  And they're not happy about it. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2892.8s)]
*  But anyway, we're at the, we're at the funeral of the dad, the guy that died. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2894.6800000000003s)]
*  And the last name is, his name was Nathan Digger. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2900.0800000000004s)]
*  Right. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2902.76s)]
*  And so I had to make a speech in front of all these people and it was like, man, [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2903.0800000000004s)]
*  I don't know if I can say this right now, but I was like, man, this is the best [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2911.32s)]

*  And Druski and them are in the bag just howling, bro. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2920.8s)]

*  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2927.84s)]

*  Yeah, it got awkward after a while. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2931.0400000000004s)]
*  Yeah, bro. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2932.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=2933.6400000000003s)]

*  You don't have to. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3312.24s)]
*  I know. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3313.3599999999997s)]
*  You don't have to. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3314.04s)]
*  You don't think? [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3315.24s)]
*  Man, it's like, part of me feel like this, I don't know, man. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3316.4s)]
*  I'm in a, I got two women right now and I just feel like I probably would be better [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3321.56s)]
*  with, with none right now, you know? [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3326.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3328.92s)]
*  You know, cause it's just like, as you get, as, as it get better, it get worse. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3329.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3334.16s)]
*  But there's something also admirable about a guy that's good, that's able to [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3334.76s)]
*  make that work though, too. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3340.0400000000004s)]
*  I think if I see that and the guy's able to make it work that he's able to take care [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3341.48s)]
*  of, of his wife or ex-wife or I feel like there's almost something a little bit [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3346.6800000000003s)]
*  admirable about it. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3350.7200000000003s)]
*  I struggle every day. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3351.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3353.2400000000002s)]
*  I struggle every day. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3354.2000000000003s)]
*  They see it every day. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3354.92s)]
*  I struggle, but you know, I feel like it's making me a better, a better person. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3356.2000000000003s)]
*  Cause now I like, I feel like the past me didn't know how to treat women. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3361.0s)]
*  Now that I got a daughter, it made me want to treat women better and it will happen [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3364.56s)]
*  right when I have two women. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3368.28s)]
*  So now I'm treating them both like queens obviously, but it gets to a point where, [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3369.6000000000004s)]
*  you know, that's another, that's another combo. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3374.2400000000002s)]
*  Look at everybody start listening. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3376.48s)]
*  Yeah, that's another combo, man. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3377.8s)]
*  That's something else, bro. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3380.08s)]
*  Definitely take, take as much time as you need. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3381.28s)]
*  Cause once you get married, it's a wrap. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3383.36s)]
*  You there. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3386.36s)]
*  It's a wrap. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3387.0s)]
*  My dad's a rapper. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3387.8s)]
*  You there. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3389.04s)]
*  It's a wrap. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3389.8s)]
*  My dad just told me he's going to propose his girlfriend on the Dallas date. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3390.56s)]
*  Why? [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3397.32s)]
*  On stage. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3397.6800000000003s)]
*  And what song are you going to play a special song for him? [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3399.84s)]
*  If she says yes. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3401.96s)]
*  Oh, I mean, he's the voice on Texas. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3403.8s)]
*  So I probably just played Texas. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3405.48s)]
*  First off, will you marry me? [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3408.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3412.4s)]
*  Dang. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3413.7200000000003s)]
*  If you got to meet some aliens, what songs would you play for me? [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3414.44s)]
*  You think? [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3416.88s)]
*  Mm hmm. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3417.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3418.52s)]
*  Mm hmm. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3419.2000000000003s)]
*  I'm from Texas. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3420.7200000000003s)]
*  And. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3423.28s)]
*  And what about some other artists? [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3426.6000000000004s)]
*  The biggest, the largest. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3427.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3429.32s)]
*  I would play that for them. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3430.6000000000004s)]
*  They would like that. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3431.36s)]
*  But if they pull up with a big ass, large ass alien, you're going to have some [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3432.32s)]
*  competition though. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3435.2400000000002s)]
*  He's going to like the song though. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3436.84s)]
*  He's going to like the song. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3438.1600000000003s)]
*  That's all I know. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3439.96s)]
*  But I definitely will play, got to play some Lil Wayne. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3441.32s)]
*  I would play. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3444.6s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3447.0s)]
*  You got to play some Lil Wayne. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3448.3199999999997s)]
*  We used to live not far from juvenile and he chased a woman down the street one [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3449.2799999999997s)]
*  night in our neighborhood. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3452.2s)]
*  We just said she did something wrong. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3456.04s)]
*  Oh, I'm assuming she did. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3458.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3460.7599999999998s)]
*  And we can probably take that out. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3461.72s)]
*  I don't want to hurt the guy's feelings. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3462.92s)]
*  I don't know if that's still pending either. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3466.04s)]
*  What, uh, yeah, I'm trying to figure out what to do. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3470.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3474.1600000000003s)]
*  I'm trying to think of what else, man. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3474.32s)]
*  You've had so much success this year. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3475.5200000000004s)]
*  Do you start to feel about different goals or you just stay, you just kind of [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3477.0800000000004s)]
*  stay in the pocket you're in? [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3479.6000000000004s)]
*  Like, what do you feel like, do you feel a responsibility to keep up with your [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3481.1600000000003s)]
*  own success now? [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3484.4s)]
*  Because that's interesting. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3485.4s)]
*  Once you start to have some success, you almost set the bar for yourself without [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3486.5200000000004s)]
*  even realizing it, right? [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3490.76s)]
*  You're just trying to achieve some goals, but then you set a bar kind of. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3492.0800000000004s)]
*  Uh, I mean, like I said, I didn't, I didn't come in this one to be the best rapper [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3495.7200000000003s)]
*  ever. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3500.0400000000004s)]
*  I didn't even want to be a rapper. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3500.44s)]
*  It was just something. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3501.5600000000004s)]
*  I had to do something to take care of my child. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3502.2s)]
*  And so like, it's just to the point where it's like, as long as I'm taking care of [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3504.52s)]
*  my child, I'm good. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3507.96s)]
*  I still don't feel like I'm treating this as the NFL because I said I wanted to, [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3508.8399999999997s)]
*  I thought I was going to be a football player. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3513.3999999999996s)]
*  The NFL stands for not for long. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3514.92s)]
*  So I gave myself five years in this. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3516.8399999999997s)]
*  I tell them every day, man, I can't wait to retire in this rap. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3519.56s)]
*  And they'd be like, yeah, you got like 10 more years. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3521.7599999999998s)]
*  And I'd be like, no, I got two. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3523.7599999999998s)]
*  And they'd be like, no, I'm like, yeah, I only got two. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3525.08s)]
*  Because after that, I'm just, I feel like movies, you know, like I'm, I'm [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3527.8399999999997s)]
*  just setting myself up for other things to bring more revenue to my family. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3532.08s)]
*  When I'm gone, my kids are going to be serious. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3537.2799999999997s)]
*  They ain't got to do nothing, but it's not like I've, I'm going to have, I'm [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3539.7599999999998s)]
*  going to be done so much, like as far as music, movies, commercials, voiceovers, [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3544.88s)]
*  whatever, you know what I'm saying? [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3550.68s)]
*  That it's going to make them want to do something. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3551.7599999999998s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3554.68s)]
*  Man, my dad did all of this. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3555.4s)]
*  I got to go do this. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3557.64s)]
*  I got to do something to make my own name. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3558.56s)]
*  I want my kids to want their own name. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3560.48s)]
*  So it's like, what everything that I'm doing right now, I'm basically [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3562.44s)]
*  doing it to make it hard on them. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3564.92s)]
*  I'll see what you're saying. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3566.48s)]
*  Cause if they're, if they're as competitive, if they have that [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3567.2400000000002s)]
*  competitive spirit and I know that's in me, cause it got passed down from my dad. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3569.56s)]
*  My brother, it's just, I know, I know that's going to be there. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3573.2s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3577.04s)]
*  And so when they, when they, when they nice and ready, I just know they're [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3578.2s)]
*  going to, they're going to put their best foot forward from, they're going to figure it out. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3581.56s)]
*  But if they don't, they got piles of cash to sit on if they don't. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3584.36s)]
*  What about a Christmas album, man? [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3588.64s)]
*  You going to do something like that for everybody? [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3590.16s)]
*  I did do a Christmas song one time where I feel like it went crazy. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3592.2s)]
*  I just dropped it at the wrong time. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3594.8799999999997s)]
*  When are you dropping in the summer? [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3596.8399999999997s)]
*  Uh, no, it was cold. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3599.0s)]
*  It was cold. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3600.92s)]
*  I actually dropped it right around Christmas. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3601.56s)]
*  It just was early in my career. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3602.96s)]
*  So like when I had less eyes, you know, but it's, I think it's over a million [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3604.96s)]
*  something right now and that I've become who I've become. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3610.04s)]
*  Maybe it could pick up then this year. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3612.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3614.64s)]
*  Yeah, I think we got 1.5 a year ago. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3615.7599999999998s)]
*  And would you ever do a mall Santa or something like that, like for [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3619.6000000000004s)]
*  children or for charity? [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3622.1600000000003s)]
*  I would. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3623.92s)]
*  Oh, that's actually a great idea. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3624.76s)]
*  That'd be sick, bro. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3626.2000000000003s)]
*  That's a great idea. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3627.44s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3629.5600000000004s)]
*  If you got to be a mall Santa, that would be pretty good. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3630.2400000000002s)]
*  Um, yeah, I don't know if we can listen to it or not because we'll have to, it'll [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3634.2000000000003s)]
*  get claimed or whatever. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3640.2000000000003s)]
*  Um, what's your show like, man? [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3641.84s)]

*  Shaking a towel. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3657.52s)]
*  There's always that one guy that's just sued the towel guy or whatever. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3658.4399999999996s)]

*  It wasn't nothing that we said, but we just, for the first time, the [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3688.76s)]
*  rehearsals before this tour and we done did three tours before like my tour, [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3691.6800000000003s)]

*  It's just, to see a big guy my size move the way I move into, you wouldn't even [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3714.2400000000002s)]
*  think that it was an hour sale. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3720.4s)]
*  I do our sets and he wouldn't, if I wouldn't sweat and so bad, you [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3721.64s)]
*  wouldn't even know I was tired. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3725.32s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3727.52s)]
*  It's just kind of like second nature to us. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3727.88s)]
*  Then we always, we were football players, so he doesn't always [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3729.36s)]
*  be under the lights. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3732.52s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3733.76s)]
*  And so I don't know. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3734.36s)]
*  That just, it just makes you want to put on more of a show. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3736.32s)]
*  Do you have some ballads in there too? [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3739.56s)]
*  Some love songs like that? [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3741.04s)]
*  I guess I used to, but now like, so the take care tour is basically, it's, I [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3743.7200000000003s)]
*  mean, it's off of the album, you know, it's basically off the album and my [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3749.6s)]
*  album wasn't more of a, it wasn't a turn up album. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3751.88s)]
*  It wasn't a for the women album. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3755.32s)]
*  It was just me speaking on me in this industry, you know, speaking [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3758.08s)]
*  on me in the now. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3762.36s)]
*  And so like now I feel like my shows are more like personal, like a lot of [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3763.6800000000003s)]
*  people that come to my shows now, they come in because they feel the same way. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3768.36s)]

*  Exactly. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3772.0s)]
*  And so. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3772.56s)]
*  Like I did in myself, I've been doubted and I still believed enough in myself to [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3773.36s)]
*  get things. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3777.4s)]

*  Uh, Oh, definitely get those meet and greets. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3924.3999999999996s)]
*  Oh, do people, yeah. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3928.7599999999998s)]
*  How do you guys, you guys do that after the shows? [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3929.72s)]
*  Uh, I try to do them before the show because after I'm all sweaty and so I like to do it before, but I don't know. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3931.84s)]
*  I also feel like after it's more like genuine, you know what I'm saying? [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3940.32s)]
*  Before I feel like it's me, it's just kind of like trying to get it. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3944.6400000000003s)]
*  And this is coming from, this is me being honest about me. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3947.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3949.92s)]
*  Before it's kind of just feel like it's like I'm going through the, like, oh, soundcheck and then meet and greet. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3950.44s)]
*  And then, but after the show, it's like, it's just more genuine because you tired and it's just the real you now. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3955.2400000000002s)]
*  You've had the show already and they've gotten to see it too. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3960.68s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3963.2799999999997s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3963.7999999999997s)]
*  So it's like, whenever they come up, like I had a guy, a grown man last night, walk up on me and tell me, bro, I love you. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3964.3199999999997s)]
*  I appreciate you because of what you got going. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3971.68s)]
*  You, you helped me. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3974.96s)]
*  I love you. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3975.7599999999998s)]
*  Tell me you love me twice. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3976.68s)]
*  You know, it's like, that's, that's, that's real love before. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3977.72s)]
*  If we would have did the meet and greet before he wouldn't have went through the show. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3981.16s)]
*  He said, I might love you. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3984.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3985.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3985.6s)]
*  Hey, great job. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3985.88s)]
*  You know, it's not all the guy, but he, he listened to the show. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3987.16s)]
*  He listened to the lyrics. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3990.4s)]
*  And yeah, after that, the energy's been there. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3991.44s)]
*  There's been that connection. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3993.88s)]
*  I think a lot of people, you don't think about it from their perspective though. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3995.16s)]
*  They're just excited to get to see you. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=3998.12s)]
*  Some people it's like, you want to hear their music, but also I think you just want to be in the same building as them. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4000.08s)]
*  And I think that's some of the energy that you have. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4004.2s)]
*  I think some people it's just their song. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4006.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4008.44s)]
*  I want to go listen for their songs. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4008.6s)]
*  I don't know if I really have a sense of them as a person, but to me, it feels like, and it's just my. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4010.56s)]
*  Thoughts that there's something else where people like, oh, I also want to be in the same room as him. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4017.08s)]
*  I just, you know, I feel like it's. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4022.88s)]
*  Um, and it's different when you got like, when you're actual, like when you're genuinely like this, you humble, it's, you know, it's just you is actually you. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4024.68s)]
*  It's not no. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4032.7599999999998s)]
*  Right. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4035.0s)]
*  You don't say when you just taking a picture of getting them out the way, you know, you enjoyed the show. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4035.36s)]
*  I just like the show was your favorite part of the show. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4040.2s)]
*  Appreciate you coming out, man. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4042.56s)]
*  People let it make them feel like. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4044.32s)]
*  You're there a person that you're a person. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4047.6s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4049.64s)]
*  When you taking the picture and moving them on out the way, you're not even that just make it seem like you're a robot. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4050.16s)]
*  Like you're the machine that's running. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4055.64s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4059.16s)]
*  And these days that's some of the best artists. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4060.28s)]
*  It's just everything is outside of the machine. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4062.32s)]
*  The machine is dirty, man. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4064.04s)]
*  That's why I feel like everything that we do right now is you doing it yourself. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4065.44s)]
*  It's stored because it's, it's all us. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4068.96s)]
*  We're doing it completely independent. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4070.72s)]
*  Who's your team? [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4072.28s)]
*  I mean, I know a lot of them right here, but just. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4073.8s)]
*  But OK, so I got a distribution deal to United Masters. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4075.2799999999997s)]
*  OK, so they don't do nothing but distribute my music. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4077.96s)]
*  I mean, they gave me a small marketing budget. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4082.44s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4084.88s)]
*  Nothing too major like a major label. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4085.4s)]
*  They pay for everything else like this tour I paid for out of my pocket. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4088.2799999999997s)]
*  Wow. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4091.36s)]
*  The bus, $200,000 on the bus. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4091.96s)]
*  I know, dude, that bus is damn expensive. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4094.32s)]
*  I think the whole bus. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4096.2s)]
*  Wait, yeah. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4097.32s)]
*  Right now was 60 is $60 to get to Rochester. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4098.96s)]
*  That's smart. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4104.08s)]
*  Or FedEx, you mail yourself overnight. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4105.96s)]
*  Not different. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4112.24s)]
*  I mean, I don't know, but I just feel like I'm kind of glad we did the best. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4113.0s)]
*  No, you have to do it. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4117.8s)]
*  You have to. It's hard to start to spend that money on yourself. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4119.2s)]
*  Like we tour comedy. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4121.32s)]
*  We just got back from Montana, some different places. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4122.6s)]
*  But it's like you just because at a certain point you invest in this in your own. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4124.52s)]
*  You have to be comfortable. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4128.0s)]
*  You can't show up like you're like rattled. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4129.4800000000005s)]
*  You know, it's like because you have to put the show on. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4131.52s)]
*  No, you're right. You're right. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4133.84s)]
*  Not trying to preach that. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4136.160000000001s)]
*  I just I tried to nickel and dime. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4137.0s)]
*  We fucking was on motorbikes one time. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4138.72s)]
*  We was on all kind of shit trying to save money. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4140.84s)]
*  Man, we had a camper. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4142.92s)]
*  We had all kinds of shit. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4144.6s)]
*  No, no. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4145.88s)]
*  Now, yeah, I mean, this was cheaper than flying everybody everywhere. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4147.200000000001s)]
*  So, yeah, and we just I just I went through the Sprinter experience [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4150.4800000000005s)]
*  and I just couldn't do that again. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4155.320000000001s)]
*  It's hard. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4156.76s)]
*  I mean, yeah, we did all that Vans Sprinter. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4157.28s)]
*  And then finally, you just have to make sure you're comfortable enough to show up. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4161.16s)]
*  Wow. Well, what a journey. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_eeYwrohQ&t=4164.5599999999995s)]
