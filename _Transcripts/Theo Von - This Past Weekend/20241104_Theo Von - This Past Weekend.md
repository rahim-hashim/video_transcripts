# Sadhguru  This Past Weekend w Theo Von #542
**Theo Von - This Past Weekend:** [November 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo)
*  I have some tour dates upcoming to tell you about Bloomington, Indiana, November 13th, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=0.0s)]

*  Lafayette, Louisiana, and Beaumont, Texas. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  There are some tickets still available, theovon.com slash T-O-U-R. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=18.04s)]
*  Make sure to go through that link so you're getting fair priced tickets. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=24.12s)]
*  Today's guest is an Indian guru and a yogi. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=29.56s)]
*  He is an author, he's a speaker, he's a spiritual teacher. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=33.72s)]
*  He is the founder of the Isha Institute, which teaches yoga as well as other spiritual practices. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=38.32s)]
*  They have a branch here in Tennessee, which is why he's here today. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=44.76s)]
*  I'm really grateful for his time. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=49.36s)]
*  Today's guest is Sadguru. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=50.92s)]
*  Tell me, how have you been? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=59.56s)]
*  Oh, frenetic, I feel like a lot of times. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=73.36s)]
*  Why? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=76.32000000000001s)]
*  That's just how I feel. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=77.32000000000001s)]
*  I think trying to do a lot of things, like trying to get my brain to shift from like [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=79.2s)]
*  sometimes like relaxing to being active or doing something, you know, it's like... [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=87.64s)]
*  Even brain is capable of doing a lot more than that. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=95.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=98.39999999999999s)]
*  Well, good. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=99.39999999999999s)]
*  That's a positive to know that for sure. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=102.32s)]
*  Yeah, I believe that. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=104.39999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I definitely believe that. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=105.91999999999999s)]
*  I mean, I'm grateful that my mind's able to kind of shift gears here and there where I [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=107.63999999999999s)]
*  need it, you know. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=110.63999999999999s)]
*  But sometimes it's like... [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=113.44s)]
*  Yeah, I think sometimes I just feel frenetic. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=115.84s)]
*  See, the thing is this... [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=119.96s)]
*  Any machine for that matter, depending on what is the volume of friction there is within [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=124.28s)]
*  it, accordingly it'll reduce its ability to do things. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=131.68s)]
*  If you take a car, let's say if you take the best car in the world and if you reduce the [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=136.0s)]
*  lubrication oil, it'll go dead in no time because of friction. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=141.88s)]
*  So this also is the same thing. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=148.04s)]
*  People's thoughts and emotions are in frictious condition. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=150.56s)]
*  So ordinary things that we can do feel stressful and all... [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=153.4s)]
*  Almost all human misery is manufactured in human mind. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=160.28s)]
*  Isn't it so? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=164.96s)]
*  So it's on the inside you're saying. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=167.12s)]
*  I'm not saying, you tell me. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=168.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=171.68s)]
*  Unless you are in a famine or a war zone or something where somebody can cause some trouble [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=172.68s)]
*  to you, rest of the time it's all self-help, isn't it? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=178.52s)]
*  Yeah, the war zone is more inside, I mean, it's not on the outside. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=182.08s)]
*  No, I'm saying physically if somebody's shooting a bullet at you, that's a different matter. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=185.36s)]
*  But right now, we are poking ourselves all the time. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=191.72s)]
*  Why? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=196.08s)]
*  The important thing is, see, to get human intelligence to its present state, it's taken [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=197.48000000000002s)]
*  millions of years of evolution. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=204.48000000000002s)]
*  From an amoeba to make you like this, it's taken millions of years of evolution. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=207.68s)]
*  It's just one word but actually tremendous amount of research and development has happened [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=213.28s)]
*  to get you to this place. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=217.84s)]
*  But now that brain is trouble for most people. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=220.24s)]
*  Ninety-five percent of the people use this brain to harm themselves. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=224.16s)]
*  Because if we give you something sharp, if I ask you a simple question, do you want your [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=229.56s)]
*  intelligence or intellect to be sharp or blunt? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=236.76s)]
*  It's a question. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=241.39999999999998s)]
*  I would like it to be sharp. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=242.16s)]
*  Sharp. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=243.32s)]
*  So if I give you something sharp, how you hold it is very important. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=244.12s)]
*  If you don't know which is the blade end, which is the handle, if you hold it tight, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=248.72s)]
*  it'll hurt you more and more. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=253.36s)]
*  Or if you're unconscious and you're like this, like this, like this, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=255.44000000000003s)]
*  intestines may come out, you know. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=258.36s)]
*  Why we don't give a knife to a child's hand? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=260.56s)]
*  Not because knife is dangerous. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=263.92s)]
*  Has it ever happened a knife popped up and stabbed someone? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=265.88s)]
*  It never happened. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=268.6s)]
*  Knife is not dangerous. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=270.28000000000003s)]
*  It's the people who hold it and how they hold it. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=271.8s)]
*  So right now, we've been given an intelligence. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=274.84000000000003s)]
*  You know, there is a… [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=278.40000000000003s)]
*  There is a… [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=280.04s)]
*  The biologists today are saying the DNA difference between you and a chimpanzee is only 1.23%. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=281.36s)]
*  1.23% is not much of a… [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=288.96000000000004s)]
*  It's not far off the jungle. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=292.84000000000003s)]
*  Not far. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=294.16s)]
*  So physiologically, that's how close we are to a chimpanzee. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=295.32s)]
*  But in terms of our intelligence and awareness, we are worlds apart. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=299.72s)]
*  So essentially, we have an intelligence for which we don't have a stable enough platform. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=304.12s)]
*  If you don't create a stable platform, stable chemistry, stable energy, stable physiology, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=310.28s)]
*  if you don't create that, your intelligence will work against you. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=315.2s)]
*  Once your intelligence works against you, there is no force in the universe which can save you. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=319.44s)]
*  You can call it stress, you can call it anxiety, misery, anger, angst, whatever. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=324.88s)]
*  Different levels of unpleasantness within you, essentially your intelligence not working for you, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=330.68s)]
*  it's working against you. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=336.96s)]
*  Wow. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=339.36s)]
*  Grateful to have you here today, Sadhguru. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=342.47999999999996s)]
*  Thank you very much for coming. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=344.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, that's a great place to start and… [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=347.44s)]
*  Good that you called me here so I… [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=348.8s)]
*  You know, I get to golf in a good golf course tomorrow morning. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=352.2s)]
*  Do you actually hit the ball or do you just imagine that it's in the hole? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=358.0s)]
*  I've had four hole-in-ones. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=362.96s)]
*  Have you really? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=364.44s)]
*  So, I'm not an imagining character. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=365.76s)]
*  No, it's good to hear. That's awesome, man. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=369.88s)]
*  I wanted to… So, you're like a sorcerer, not a sorcerer. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=373.24s)]
*  What is you got? You're a visualizer? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=377.28s)]
*  What is kind of the terminology that they use for… [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=386.08000000000004s)]
*  I'm a full-fledged human being. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=388.44s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=390.16s)]
*  Is that good? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=390.76000000000005s)]
*  That's fair. Okay. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=391.32s)]
*  Because… [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=392.84000000000003s)]
*  As long as you… [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=393.6s)]
*  Right now, human beings are always trying to cripple themselves with their thoughts, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=394.96000000000004s)]
*  with their emotions, their whatever else. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=398.92s)]
*  If you… If you do one thing, that in your life you are not the impediment… [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=403.12s)]
*  You're not the what? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=408.28000000000003s)]
*  You're not the impediment, you're not the problem, you're not the issue. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=409.20000000000005s)]
*  There are thousand issues you need to handle in the world. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=413.12s)]
*  The more you try to do, the more problems and more troubles there will be. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=415.32s)]
*  All those things you handle to the best of your ability. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=419.56s)]
*  But you are not the issue in your life. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=422.2s)]
*  If you just ascertain this one thing, that you yourself are not an issue, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=424.08s)]
*  just check and see for most human beings, they themselves are an issue. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=429.64s)]
*  Their thought, their emotion, their needs, their compulsiveness, that's what is the big problem. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=434.36s)]
*  Outside problems are small. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=439.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=441.52s)]
*  So, if you ensure that you are not the issue in your life, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=442.16s)]
*  then you are naturally a full-fledged human being. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=446.28000000000003s)]
*  You will do the best that you can do in everything that you do. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=449.4s)]
*  Well, your best may not be the best, but it's the best that you can do. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=452.84000000000003s)]
*  In your life, if you do not do what you cannot do, there's no problem. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=458.36s)]
*  But if you do not do what you can do, you're a disaster. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=464.16s)]
*  But the moment your thought, your emotion is tripping you all the time, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=468.40000000000003s)]
*  you will not even do what you can do, isn't it? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=473.32s)]
*  And how do we get ourselves in the best situation to be able to do what we can do? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=476.92s)]
*  They tell me right now, we don't like the weather outside, for October it's too hot in Nashville. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=481.68s)]
*  So, what have you done? Turned on the air conditioning. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=490.8s)]
*  What is the air conditioning called? This is climate engineering. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=493.64s)]
*  You engineer the climate the way you want. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=497.8s)]
*  How come your inner climate is not engineered properly? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=501.56s)]
*  It gets hot, it gets cold, it gets boiling. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=506.0s)]
*  Yeah, it gets confusing. You don't even know what it is. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=509.44s)]
*  Why is it that your inner engineering has not been done [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=512.04s)]
*  so that you have the conducive climate that you want? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=516.08s)]
*  So, my whole work is this, that to teach people how to engineer themselves. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=520.56s)]
*  When I say engineer, people think it's some technology kind of thing, we need to understand. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=526.0s)]
*  What we call as engineering today used to be magic at one time. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=531.76s)]
*  Oh yeah, I've heard of it. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=535.68s)]
*  Yeah, magic, yeah, they had wizards, everything. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=538.04s)]
*  Like, not like that. If I sat here a thousand years ago and did... and lights came on, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=540.96s)]
*  what would you think I am? Not magic. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=551.64s)]
*  Maybe a electrician? [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=555.24s)]
*  No, come on, there was no electricity a thousand years ago. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=556.88s)]
*  You'd have been a very... I thought you'd have been mystical. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=560.6400000000001s)]
*  I could have said I'm the messenger. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=564.32s)]
*  Oh, you could have said you're a messiah. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=567.6s)]
*  Yes. Or I could have claimed I'm the son. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=569.6800000000001s)]
*  Or I could have said I'm himself. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=573.2800000000001s)]
*  If just I turned on the light bulb. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=577.2s)]
*  Unfortunately, I didn't have a light bulb a thousand years ago. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=580.0s)]
*  Now everybody has it, so it's not magic anymore, it's just engineering. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=583.4s)]
*  So I'm just saying, engineering means when you engineer something well, it's more than magical. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=587.2s)]
*  No magic can do those things that we are doing, isn't it? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=595.04s)]
*  You pick up your phone and talk to just about anybody in the world. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=598.6800000000001s)]
*  If you did this two hundred years ago, you could have claimed your god himself. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=601.96s)]
*  So, if you engineer your interiority in the way it works for you, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=607.52s)]
*  there are many ways to describe it. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=612.36s)]
*  A simple way to say this is, let's say we create a chemistry. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=613.8000000000001s)]
*  Today everybody knows that all their experiences are in somehow connected to their chemical structure. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=619.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=626.36s)]
*  What you call as joy is one kind of chemistry, misery is another kind of chemistry, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=627.0s)]
*  anxiety is one kind of chemistry, tranquility is another kind of chemistry, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=631.5600000000001s)]
*  agony, ecstasy, everything has a chemical basis. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=635.8000000000001s)]
*  So, in many ways, if you look at the biochemistry of a human being, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=641.24s)]
*  it is the most complex chemical factory on the planet. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=646.48s)]
*  That's true. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=650.76s)]
*  It is. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=651.6s)]
*  Because the number of things that are happening every moment in every molecule of DNA and stuff is unbelievable. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=653.24s)]
*  Suppose you can create a chemistry the way you want it, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=661.44s)]
*  would you create a chemistry of blissfulness or misery? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=666.6400000000001s)]
*  Choose, choose, I'm going to bless you. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=670.76s)]
*  Blissfulness. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=672.84s)]
*  You must choose quickly. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=673.76s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=674.72s)]
*  That's all I did and that's all I'm teaching people, how to create a chemistry of blissfulness. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=676.72s)]
*  So, suppose you're blissful, no matter what, if you sit, stand, eat, don't eat, you're blissful. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=682.32s)]
*  If you're blissful, essentially what it means is there is no fear of suffering. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=689.88s)]
*  Only when there is no fear of suffering, will you take full strides in your life. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=696.4s)]
*  Otherwise, every step is a half a step. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=702.08s)]
*  That's all that's happening to humanity. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=705.16s)]
*  The fear of suffering is crippling them, not allowing their geniuses to flower. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=707.12s)]
*  Every human being is capable of this, but it's not happening because the fear of suffering, what will happen to me? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=712.6800000000001s)]
*  So, if you are given this assurance, no matter what happens around you, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=719.76s)]
*  nothing happens to you. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=724.04s)]
*  You are the way you are, you're blissed out all the time. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=725.04s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, you got to get blissed out. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=727.32s)]
*  Yeah, I understand that. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=729.72s)]
*  So, if you can... [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=730.68s)]
*  No, no, no, I didn't ask you to go for those things. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=732.52s)]
*  Blissed out mean not that. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=734.56s)]
*  No. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=736.24s)]
*  Blissed out mean like this. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=737.48s)]
*  Okay. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=738.88s)]
*  That is I fixed my chemistry from inside, not from outside. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=739.36s)]
*  So, that's what you're... Right, right. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=742.84s)]
*  So, you're saying if I get myself to a state that... [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=744.68s)]
*  Because the state I can control is the state that I am. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=748.64s)]
*  So, if I can keep that state as comfortable as possible, then... [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=752.0s)]
*  Don't use the word comfort. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=757.12s)]
*  Okay. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=758.76s)]
*  See, the chemistry causes bliss. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=759.8000000000001s)]
*  See, every human being at some moment in their life, they have had blissful experiences. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=761.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=767.08s)]
*  Joyful experiences. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=767.44s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=768.44s)]
*  Loving experiences, ecstatic experiences. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=768.9200000000001s)]
*  At the same time, they've all... versions of negativity experiences also have happened. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=771.72s)]
*  So, essentially, are you competent of being blissful and ecstatic? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=776.6800000000001s)]
*  You are because it's happened to you already. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=781.76s)]
*  It's not like... [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=783.6800000000001s)]
*  You're not like a rock where it didn't go into such an experience. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=784.5600000000001s)]
*  You have gone into that experience. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=788.96s)]
*  Now, only the question is about sustainability. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=790.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=793.48s)]
*  Sustainability is a problem right now because most experiences are happening in an unconscious manner. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=794.72s)]
*  You are not causing it. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=801.6800000000001s)]
*  Something else is causing it, an external stimuli. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=803.24s)]
*  I look at something beautiful, wow. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=806.52s)]
*  Why am I not... wow, without... with my eyes closed? [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=810.0s)]
*  This is what I realized very early on in my life. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=812.72s)]
*  You know, one thing I realized was when I was just four-and-a-half years of age, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=817.5600000000001s)]
*  I realized I don't know anything. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=822.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=825.0400000000001s)]
*  Don't know anything means don't know anything at all. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=826.2800000000001s)]
*  To such an extent, if somebody gives me a glass of water, I don't know what is water. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=829.0400000000001s)]
*  I know how to use it, I know how to drink it, I know all the other things you can do, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=835.44s)]
*  but I don't know what it is. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=838.72s)]
*  Actually, even today you don't know what it is. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=840.08s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=842.24s)]
*  You will say it's too. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=843.72s)]
*  But with all this scientific exploration, we still do not know one atom in its entirety. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=845.64s)]
*  We know how to use it, we know how to fuse it, we know how to make a bomb out of it, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=852.9200000000001s)]
*  but we don't know what it is. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=858.5600000000001s)]
*  So, if I find a leaf, I'm just looking at it for hours on end. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=861.44s)]
*  If I sit up in my bed, I'm staring at the darkness for the whole night. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=866.56s)]
*  My dear father, being a physician, he started thinking I need psychiatric evaluation [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=870.88s)]
*  because this boy is staring at something all the time. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=876.56s)]
*  Yeah, he's a daydreamer. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=880.28s)]
*  I'm not dreaming, I'm just paying attention. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=883.48s)]
*  See, I look at this, I don't know what this is. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=886.36s)]
*  So, I'm not able to look at the other thing because I still don't know what this is. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=889.24s)]
*  So, I went on like this and in this condition, they sent me to school. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=894.0s)]
*  My mother said, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=901.2800000000001s)]
*  you must pay attention to the teachers, don't look here and there. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=902.64s)]
*  So, I went on and paid attention to the teacher, [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=906.08s)]
*  the kind of attention they had never received in their entire life, that kind of attention. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=908.6800000000001s)]
*  Then, you know, initially I saw... [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=914.88s)]
*  I kind of understood what they were trying to say. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=918.64s)]
*  Then I saw, actually they're only making sounds. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=921.88s)]
*  I'm making up the meanings in my mind. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=925.84s)]
*  See, right now if I start talking in one of the Indian languages, [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=928.4s)]
*  you know, India has over 19,000 languages. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=931.8000000000001s)]
*  Oh, that's a lot. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=934.0s)]
*  If I speak one of those languages, as far as you're concerned, it'll be just sound. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=935.5600000000001s)]
*  You can't attach meanings to it. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=942.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=943.96s)]
*  So, language is a kind of a conspiracy between two people. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=944.96s)]
*  I utter one sound, you make up the meaning, you utter another sound, I make up the meaning. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=948.1600000000001s)]
*  So, I just sat there, oh, they're only making sounds, I'm making up the meanings. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=952.3199999999999s)]
*  I stopped making up meanings, just listen to the sound. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=957.1999999999999s)]
*  Very attentively, not disregarding, listening carefully. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=961.04s)]
*  Then I found it so amusing, teacher after teacher, they come and make noises and noises and noises. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=965.1999999999999s)]
*  A big smile spread on my face, but they were not amused at all. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=971.4399999999999s)]
*  So, this happened probably twelve, thirteen years ago, it's twenty-four now, probably fourteen years ago. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=978.7199999999999s)]
*  This school where I studied over fifty plus years ago, they came to invite me for their 125th anniversary. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=988.68s)]
*  Wow! [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=996.3599999999999s)]
*  I said, see, you know, they came and said many things. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=998.0s)]
*  I said, please see, I was not just a not good student. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1003.8399999999999s)]
*  I was not even a student. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1008.48s)]
*  I only came there when it is a must, otherwise I escaped. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1011.0s)]
*  So why me? [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1014.84s)]
*  Then they said, no, no, our school has produced film stars. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1016.44s)]
*  Our school has produced cricketing stars, you know, in India cricket. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1021.0400000000001s)]
*  If you don't know anything about cricket, they'll take away your passport. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1025.76s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1028.56s)]
*  Then I'll lie, I guess. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1029.56s)]
*  So we have produced cricketing stars, we have produced music stars. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1033.2s)]
*  But you are the only mystic, you must come. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1037.6399999999999s)]
*  I said, okay. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1039.6799999999998s)]
*  And I went there. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1041.48s)]
*  I stood in the quarter angle, looked around, same oppressive buildings. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1042.9599999999998s)]
*  Then I suddenly remembered in this particular classroom what happened. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1048.48s)]
*  I must have been around twelve, little over twelve years of age. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1051.6399999999999s)]
*  One day a teacher comes and asks me a question. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1057.9199999999998s)]
*  I've slowly graduated to a place where initially I was not attaching meanings to the sounds. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1060.6799999999998s)]
*  Sometimes I'm not even hearing the sounds. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1066.8s)]
*  If I see somebody, I see just a blob of energy and all kinds of things happening. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1068.72s)]
*  But I'm just fully attention, but I can't even hear what they're saying. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1074.12s)]
*  Wow. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1079.12s)]
*  So he asked me a question and I'm just looking at him without a single word. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1080.12s)]
*  And he tries to get an answer out of me for over thirty-five minutes. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1085.2s)]
*  When he doesn't hear, I get it. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1088.64s)]
*  He comes and holds me by the shoulder, shakes me violently like this and says, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1091.08s)]
*  you must either be the divine or the devil. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1096.4s)]
*  I think you're the later. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1099.8400000000001s)]
*  Then, till then my problem was what is this, what is that, what is that, what is this? [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1101.8400000000001s)]
*  Because I don't have an answer for one damn thing. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1110.76s)]
*  Everybody makes conclusions, nobody knows. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1113.0800000000002s)]
*  All right? [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1114.88s)]
*  We don't even know a single atom properly. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1115.88s)]
*  We don't know where we are in this cosmos. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1119.0800000000002s)]
*  All right? [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1121.0s)]
*  Hello? [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1122.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1123.0s)]
*  We don't know where we come from, where we go, what. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1124.0s)]
*  People can invent and believe simple things, that's different. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1127.36s)]
*  But if you really sincerely ask a question, you don't know. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1129.8s)]
*  So till that moment, I don't know anything, but I knew I'm this. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1135.52s)]
*  Suddenly I got confused. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1141.8s)]
*  Is this divine or devil? [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1143.6799999999998s)]
*  What is it? [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1145.1999999999998s)]
*  I just tried to stare at myself. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1146.1999999999998s)]
*  It didn't work, so I started closing my eyes. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1149.36s)]
*  And till that moment, looking at everything, the visual contact with life around me, from [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1153.0s)]
*  an insect to an ant to a leaf to just about anything, looked absolutely engaging and amazing [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1159.04s)]
*  to me, endlessly. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1165.2s)]
*  See, it's made in such a way, if you pay enough attention, you can spend a lifetime studying [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1166.8s)]
*  an ant and you will still not know fully what it is in hundred years of life. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1172.16s)]
*  That's how profound and sophisticated and complex life is. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1178.68s)]
*  So I'm excited about anything and everything looks amazing to me. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1183.08s)]
*  But then I realized when I close my eyes, this whole thing exploded to another dimension [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1188.04s)]
*  because what is within, when I say within, not just thought emotion, as a life, what [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1193.52s)]
*  is happening within is so phenomenal that I had no need to open my eyes. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1198.08s)]
*  If I close my eyes, I just keep it closed for hours and hours. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1203.56s)]
*  Wow. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1206.36s)]
*  Yeah, the inner world. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1207.36s)]
*  Yeah, it's like a whole other universe, I guess, when you close your eyes and you start [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1209.56s)]
*  to look within yourself. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1213.08s)]
*  And I want to ask you about some of that. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1214.84s)]
*  I want to ask you first and say thank you very much for being here today, Saguru. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1216.8799999999999s)]
*  I'm very happy to see you and spend time with you. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1221.28s)]
*  Some of my best friends are extreme fans of yours. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1225.04s)]
*  Really? [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1228.08s)]
*  Yes. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1229.08s)]
*  What is guys? [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1230.08s)]
*  Yeah, my friend James Bushara is a huge fan of yours. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1231.08s)]
*  He's been to I think some institutes maybe that you have in India. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1233.24s)]
*  Are you… [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1240.6s)]
*  That's where you're… [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1241.6s)]
*  Here we have… [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1242.6s)]
*  Yeah, one in Tennessee. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1243.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1244.6s)]
*  Yeah, the Ish… [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1245.6s)]
*  Ish… [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1246.6s)]
*  Ish… [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1247.6s)]
*  Ishha Institute of Inner Sciences. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1248.6s)]
*  Ishha Institute of Inner Sciences. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1249.6s)]
*  And you started in India, though, that's where you're from. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1250.6s)]
*  And what is the main religion in India, just so some of our audience can get familiar? [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1253.24s)]
*  Or like what's the… [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1257.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1260.32s)]
*  If I say it in a few words, they may not understand, so let me take a few minutes and explain this. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1261.32s)]
*  See, religion is a very external thing for us in India. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1266.08s)]
*  We don't have a religion or the religion like that. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1272.08s)]
*  We see that every human being has to pursue his pursuit of truth, wanting to know what [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1277.2s)]
*  is the nature of our existence here. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1283.56s)]
*  And the only goal is to find liberation from the mechanics of life, which sometimes give [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1287.44s)]
*  you a high, sometimes give you a low, sometimes makes you feel like top of the world, sometimes [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1294.02s)]
*  crushes you. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1299.68s)]
*  What is the basis of all this? [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1301.44s)]
*  To figure this, we have methods and methods and methods. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1302.8600000000001s)]
*  Everybody who follows one method, they may think this is my way, but nobody has any issue [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1308.04s)]
*  with the other. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1312.92s)]
*  I mean, this part of the world will have difficulty understanding. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1314.92s)]
*  In the same house, if there are five people, they will be worshipping five different deities. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1318.24s)]
*  But there is no clash about it, there is no problem about it because… [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1324.3200000000002s)]
*  Well, see, it's up to you, if you can relate to this plant, you can worship this plant. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1327.5600000000002s)]
*  If you can relate to your mother, you worship your mother. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1332.26s)]
*  If you can relate to the cloud, worship the cloud. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1334.52s)]
*  Because the important thing is how you feel about it. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1337.38s)]
*  See, people are always thinking… [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1340.52s)]
*  I mean, this is a very common terminology here, so I'm saying this, this is not about [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1342.76s)]
*  cultural… this thing. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1346.84s)]
*  See, for example, somebody says, I love somebody. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1348.72s)]
*  Why? [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1352.84s)]
*  Because he's the perfect person. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1353.84s)]
*  That is different. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1357.52s)]
*  You may realize after some time how perfect somebody is. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1358.68s)]
*  Nobody is perfect, all right? [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1361.52s)]
*  The thing is you love them. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1363.4s)]
*  That is what is so special about it. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1364.8s)]
*  Not because they are perfect, you love them. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1367.54s)]
*  Because you love them, they look so wonderful. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1370.62s)]
*  So this is a fundamental aspect that we see our subjectivity determines everything. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1373.5s)]
*  I see. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1379.3799999999999s)]
*  So it's not that… even going to that example of love, it's not that you love the person [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1380.3799999999999s)]
*  because they're a certain way, it's that you love them because you love them. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1386.04s)]
*  You love them, so everything about them looks nice. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1389.78s)]
*  Got it. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1391.8999999999999s)]
*  So similarly, you relate to it whichever way. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1393.46s)]
*  The important thing is your experience of life should become profound. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1396.5s)]
*  If a plant can do it, if a tree can do it, if a dog can do it, a man or woman can do [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1401.5s)]
*  it or some other entity that you think of, do it, it doesn't matter to us. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1405.54s)]
*  Whereas the important thing is every day as life goes by, your experience of life should [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1410.78s)]
*  become more profound. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1416.38s)]
*  Profound means you have deeper roots into life, not living on the surface. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1418.8600000000001s)]
*  Because if you're living on the surface, one gale and you get blown away. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1423.74s)]
*  Yeah, one strong wind, a flood, a… [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1427.46s)]
*  Yes. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1429.7s)]
*  Anything. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1430.7s)]
*  So to have real roots into the life. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1431.7s)]
*  So fundamentally it is to live and to live totally, that is the only thing. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1434.3s)]
*  But it's not a religion because the word religion essentially implies you have to believe something. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1439.5s)]
*  India has always been recognized as a land of seekers. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1446.46s)]
*  A seeker means you can be a genuine seeker only if you realize, I do not know, isn't it? [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1451.6599999999999s)]
*  Ah. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1457.58s)]
*  If you see, I don't know something, you don't have to label yourself as a seeker. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1458.58s)]
*  The human intelligence is such it'll start seeking. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1464.02s)]
*  You do not know where is the light switch. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1468.1799999999998s)]
*  You will seek, isn't it? [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1471.4599999999998s)]
*  Understood. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1474.4199999999998s)]
*  So saying, I don't know is the beginning of… [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1475.9399999999998s)]
*  I do not know is a tremendous possibility. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1478.26s)]
*  Whether it is science or spirituality, the fundamental is I do not know. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1481.8600000000001s)]
*  Only if you see I do not know, the longing to know will come and the possibility of knowing [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1486.9s)]
*  will arise. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1492.14s)]
*  Everything that you do not know, if you believe, it will give you confidence, that is the whole [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1493.14s)]
*  thing. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1497.9s)]
*  If you need confidence, you must believe something. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1499.1000000000001s)]
*  But confidence without clarity can become disastrous. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1502.06s)]
*  Like what does that mean? [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1506.58s)]
*  See, right now, let's say this room is pitch dark. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1507.62s)]
*  You can't see, there's no clarity. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1511.78s)]
*  But you have confidence, you'll walk over me. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1514.26s)]
*  If you have no confidence, at least gently you will feel your way through. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1517.06s)]
*  But if you are confident, you will blunder through everything. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1521.82s)]
*  This is what is happening to a whole lot of people. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1525.46s)]
*  Because they have confidence where there is no clarity. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1527.9399999999998s)]
*  The confidence is not a substitute for clarity. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1531.02s)]
*  Seeing things clearly is most important. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1535.02s)]
*  Confidence means you assume something and invest your emotion in it and you become confident. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1538.58s)]
*  So the question is just this, do you want solace or do you want a solution to life? [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1543.3799999999999s)]
*  Do you want solace or do you want a solution to life? [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1550.42s)]
*  And what does the word solace mean just so we… [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1553.26s)]
*  Solace means we somehow convince you, don't worry, everything will be okay. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1555.42s)]
*  I see. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1558.82s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1559.82s)]
*  Do you want to be convinced or do you want to… [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1560.82s)]
*  To know. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1562.94s)]
*  Do you want to know? [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1564.42s)]
*  To know. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1565.42s)]
*  Or do you want to just be convinced about something? [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1566.42s)]
*  See, right now in this room of all of us, said this is it. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1568.22s)]
*  Among us it becomes the truth, but it's not the truth. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1573.1000000000001s)]
*  All of us say that we are not in Tennessee, we are in Timbuktu. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1577.5s)]
*  So among us, we are Timbuktu people. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1584.3s)]
*  But when you step out, you're in Tennessee. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1587.9s)]
*  All right? [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1591.14s)]
*  I've heard you talk recently about how evolution is not biological anymore, where we are as [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1593.58s)]
*  human beings, right? [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1601.78s)]
*  And that it's more about our conscious now. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1604.98s)]
*  Can you expound a little bit on that for me? [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1607.46s)]
*  The way it has shaped us and the way we have evolved is not accidental. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1611.54s)]
*  It's got something to do with the planetary system as how this it is, how the whole system [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1616.3799999999999s)]
*  works. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1623.34s)]
*  Or in other words, this solar system is working like a potter's wheel to manufacture the [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1624.34s)]
*  life that it has manufactured. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1630.9399999999998s)]
*  To understand this, there are various aspects to it, mathematical aspects to it, let me [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1633.8999999999999s)]
*  not get into that. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1639.9399999999998s)]
*  One important thing is the relationship between the sun and the earth. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1642.86s)]
*  We know all life here is solar powered, just everything. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1648.5s)]
*  The whole system of evolution happened because when those very smart algae or fungi, we don't [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1653.3s)]
*  know which one, which one got smarter first. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1659.98s)]
*  Of who? [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1662.74s)]
*  Of algae and fungi. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1663.74s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1665.02s)]
*  Between the two, there's a competition, both are claiming we did it first. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1666.02s)]
*  Okay. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1670.94s)]
*  Some billion years ago, they learnt one trick, how to manufacture food from sunlight. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1672.6599999999999s)]
*  Today, we call that photosynthesis. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1679.18s)]
*  It is that photosynthesis, which is the basis of all life on this planet, the plant life [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1683.02s)]
*  came and then animal life, everything happened. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1687.42s)]
*  But the fundamental thing is we learnt how to transform sun's energy into food and energy [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1690.86s)]
*  for ourselves, for life. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1696.98s)]
*  So it's from there that came. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1699.34s)]
*  So today, we are also… we may not be directly solar powered, but everything that we eat [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1701.78s)]
*  is solar powered. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1706.5s)]
*  If you don't go out in the sun for a year, you know, you become paled out. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1708.1s)]
*  So it is the solar energy that's important, which also controls the movement of the earth [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1715.26s)]
*  around itself. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1721.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1722.82s)]
*  This 365 days or whatever and the moon's movement around the earth, which is twenty-eight [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1723.82s)]
*  days or twenty-seven plus something days. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1730.02s)]
*  All this is very related to our birth. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1734.6999999999998s)]
*  One simple fact is this, if our mother's bodies were not in sync with the cycles of [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1737.9s)]
*  the moon, we wouldn't be born. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1745.06s)]
*  Oh, that's true, huh? [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1747.54s)]
*  Because menstrual cycle is related to the moon. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1750.26s)]
*  It's exactly the moon cycle. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1751.98s)]
*  Wow! [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1753.7s)]
*  So, you want to know the yogic doomsday? [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1754.7s)]
*  We are not doomsayers, but there is a yogic doomsday. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1760.34s)]
*  This calculation was made maybe some twenty-six, twenty-seven thousand years ago, I'm sorry. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1763.7s)]
*  Yep. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1772.9s)]
*  They made a calculation and said, every year the moon is moving away from the planet, approximately [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1774.4s)]
*  an inch and a quarter, about fifteen millimeters per year, moon is… moon's orbit is moving [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1782.26s)]
*  away. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1792.1000000000001s)]
*  They made a calculation in twenty-eight thousand years, the moon will go so far away from the [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1793.1s)]
*  moon… from the earth that human women will not have menstrual cycles. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1800.3s)]
*  No. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1805.1s)]
*  So, quietly human race will end. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1806.1s)]
*  They're going to be angry too. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1808.4599999999998s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1809.82s)]
*  The women are going to be angry if they don't have them, I bet. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1811.6999999999998s)]
*  Not angry, they won't be women anymore. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1815.2199999999998s)]
*  Oh, that's a good point, huh? [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1817.3799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, that's true. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1818.86s)]
*  So once they're not women, man will die too. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1821.46s)]
*  Wow. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1825.02s)]
*  So, it's not by ice or fire or bomb. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1826.02s)]
*  If we don't do that beforehand, in twenty-eight thousand years it can happen, but this calculation [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1830.26s)]
*  was made… [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1835.98s)]
*  I'm sorry, I said the wrong number. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1836.98s)]
*  It's about three thousand four hundred… three thousand five hundred years ago they [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1838.74s)]
*  made this calculation. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1842.16s)]
*  So approximately twenty-four thousand five hundred or twenty-five thousand years later [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1843.7s)]
*  this can happen because it is a fact that moon is moving away from the earth approximately [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1848.46s)]
*  fifteen millimeters. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1854.06s)]
*  So, we're on the clock right now. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1855.06s)]
*  Yes. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1857.14s)]
*  Twenty-five thousand years you will die. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1858.14s)]
*  Is that okay? [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1859.46s)]
*  I'm already upset about it. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1860.46s)]
*  Are you able to gamble responsibly? [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1865.1000000000001s)]
*  Well, I've got a question for you then. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1867.1000000000001s)]
*  Do you think you know who will win the presidential election or how many seats the Democrats or [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1870.66s)]
*  Republicans will win in the House or Senate? [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1876.18s)]
*  Well, there's finally a legal way to bet on the outcome of these elections through [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1878.9s)]
*  a platform called Cal-She. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1883.9s)]
*  Cal-She is the first legal exchange where you can bet on any event including the upcoming [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1886.5s)]
*  election. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1892.5400000000002s)]
*  Cal-She went to court and won legal approval for election betting for the first time in [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1893.5400000000002s)]
*  over one hundred years. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1898.98s)]
*  They have markets on who will win the presidential election, who will control the House and [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1901.5s)]
*  Senate, who will win swing states and more. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1905.86s)]
*  Cal-She is already being used by hundreds of thousands of people and has facilitated [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1909.58s)]
*  over one billion dollars worth of trades. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1914.1s)]
*  Let's take an example. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1917.54s)]
*  Right now Trump and Kamala are trading at about fifty-fifty meaning if you place a bet [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1919.02s)]
*  on either you will double your money if they end up winning. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=1923.9399999999998s)]

*  But this movement away from the earth need not be 15 millimeters as it goes away. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2129.2000000000003s)]
*  As earth's gravity's influence becomes less and less, it could start moving little faster. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2136.1s)]
*  But they say approximately this can happen in 28,000 years at that time. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2142.16s)]
*  For 25,000 years, let's say. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2146.12s)]
*  So this is how we are right now, the form of our body, the shape and how it works. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2149.64s)]
*  Everything is very connected to the system in which we exist. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2156.04s)]
*  So we have recognized nine celestial bodies which have maximum influence on us. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2160.3199999999997s)]
*  There are fourteen, fifteen of them, but nine of them have very strong influence. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2166.08s)]
*  In that, the most important three are the sun, the moon and the planet itself. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2171.48s)]
*  So we are a consequence of this planetary system. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2176.68s)]
*  This happened approximately fourteen, fifteen thousand years ago or more. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2182.32s)]
*  This question was asked to the first yogi. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2188.46s)]
*  We call him Adiyogi, that means the first yogi. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2193.2400000000002s)]
*  Dr. Jayaprakash Narayanan Adiyogi? [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2195.52s)]
*  Yeah, that means the first yogi. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2196.52s)]
*  The first yogi was asked this question that all these things you are teaching us and we [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2198.62s)]
*  are struggling to understand and grow, why can't human system be evolved to a bigger [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2202.8599999999997s)]
*  possibility? [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2208.7s)]
*  Essentially, they're asking why can't we increase the size of our brain or capacity, [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2209.7s)]
*  something like that. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2215.06s)]
*  So he explained something. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2216.8599999999997s)]
*  He said, if something like that has to happen, some fundamental change in the planetary system [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2218.46s)]
*  needs to happen. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2225.7999999999997s)]
*  Otherwise, it cannot happen. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2226.7999999999997s)]
*  You have reached the peak of physiological evolution. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2229.3s)]
*  But of course, anything that we said in the past, we don't believe, it has to come from [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2231.84s)]
*  our universities and laboratories, all right? [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2235.2400000000002s)]
*  Today, our laboratories and universities are saying this neurologically, if you want [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2238.02s)]
*  to increase the capacity of your brain, one thing you can do is pack more neurons into [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2243.7400000000002s)]
*  your head. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2250.62s)]
*  Okay. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2251.62s)]
*  Like a lot of children come like this, they come with excessive neuronal capacity, but [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2252.62s)]
*  they're unstable because too much. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2257.7s)]
*  They are brilliant, but brilliance can't do anything without balance, you know? [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2262.7799999999997s)]
*  It'll work against you. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2267.58s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2268.58s)]
*  A lot of kids are really on balance. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2269.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2270.58s)]
*  So one simple thing to do for these children is unfortunately here you take them to the [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2271.58s)]
*  doctor, medicate them to see when you give a medicine to slow down something, everything [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2274.66s)]
*  slows down, all right? [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2280.8999999999996s)]
*  You don't have a tablet which will go and act only in that place. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2282.62s)]
*  It will slow down everything. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2286.26s)]
*  Sedations are given to children like anything, it's a wrong way to do it. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2288.0200000000004s)]
*  If children are like this, the thing you need to do is take them out into the mountains, [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2291.3s)]
*  make them climb, play a game, swim, physical activity, intense physical activity, it'll [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2296.1400000000003s)]
*  burn down what is excess. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2302.2200000000003s)]
*  Or if you can teach them the classical system of yoga, it will do that very well. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2304.9s)]
*  But if that is not possible, you have enough space in United States, let them run in the [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2309.94s)]
*  mountains, let them swim in the river, whatever, physical activity to burn it down. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2315.14s)]
*  Another way of enhancing the capacity is you increase the size of the neuron. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2320.8199999999997s)]
*  See right now as you sit here in a restful state, twenty percent or more of your energy [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2326.18s)]
*  is spent on your brain. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2333.16s)]
*  Your brain is only this much. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2335.5s)]
*  I'm sorry, that much, okay? [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2337.02s)]
*  Yeah, but it could be a little less over here too. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2338.66s)]
*  So if your brain is this much, it's consuming twenty percent of the energy. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2341.5s)]
*  This big body is consuming eighty percent. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2345.9s)]
*  This much brain is consuming twenty percent, that is the nature of the brain. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2349.28s)]
*  If you increase the neuron size, the volume of energy it'll consume will be such, even [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2353.72s)]
*  your physical growth will not happen properly and you cannot sustain that. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2358.86s)]
*  So today, neuronal scientists are explaining it this way. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2364.18s)]
*  Way back fifteen thousand years ago Adiyogi said, unless there are fundamental changes [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2367.84s)]
*  in the planetary system, you cannot evolve beyond, but you can evolve consciously. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2373.48s)]
*  I see. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2378.1600000000003s)]
*  So physiologically, body-wise we can't evolve anymore. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2379.44s)]
*  We've evolved… [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2382.88s)]
*  If you're thinking of growing horns or something… [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2383.88s)]
*  Or wings or something, yeah. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2387.4s)]
*  That won't happen. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2389.52s)]
*  But the existing system is largely unused. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2391.04s)]
*  So the inner system, the conscious… [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2396.62s)]
*  Yes. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2398.7799999999997s)]
*  Let's… [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2399.7799999999997s)]
*  No, don't even go to consciousness. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2400.7799999999997s)]
*  That's another thing. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2401.7799999999997s)]
*  If you wish to go there today, we will go, otherwise we won't go. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2402.7799999999997s)]
*  Just the neuronal system is largely unused. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2405.3399999999997s)]
*  Most studies say our brain capacity is only used eight to twelve percent in average human [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2410.94s)]
*  beings. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2416.54s)]
*  Wow. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2417.54s)]
*  Some are using up to twenty percent. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2418.54s)]
*  Yeah, some are not. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2419.54s)]
*  Yes. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2420.9s)]
*  Twenty percent is still not a great percentage. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2421.9s)]
*  No, yeah. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2423.66s)]
*  Because… [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2424.66s)]
*  It's like a G minus, I think. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2425.8599999999997s)]
*  I don't know what that is. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2427.58s)]
*  I don't even know what it is. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2428.58s)]
*  Because I didn't go to school much, so I don't know what grades they gave me. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2429.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2434.2999999999997s)]
*  Let us imagine they were good, you know. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2435.2999999999997s)]
*  So if we only are using up to twenty percent, but you believe that we can evolve that. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2439.58s)]
*  Yes. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2444.18s)]
*  Wow. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2445.18s)]
*  You can push it. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2446.18s)]
*  If you push it to hundred percent, you'll be five times at least, probably many, many [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2447.18s)]
*  fold more than what you are right now in terms of your intelligence and capacity, which some [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2452.62s)]
*  human beings are displaying, all right? [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2457.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2459.3399999999997s)]
*  So initially you said about this, whatever. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2460.3399999999997s)]
*  See, for example, the number of things I'm doing, probably, I don't know what you know [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2463.22s)]
*  about us, the number of projects and things, all being done by a volunteer organization. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2467.42s)]
*  Every day, you know, I have to guide them. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2473.3799999999997s)]
*  It's not like they're professionally trained. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2475.5s)]
*  Training a volunteer organization means nobody is trained for the job. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2478.34s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2481.82s)]
*  They're enthusiastic. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2482.82s)]
*  Yeah, they're enthusiastic. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2483.82s)]
*  But they're not trained for the job. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2484.82s)]
*  And you can't fire them for inefficiency to try to run something like this. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2487.82s)]
*  Over 18,000, I mean, 18 million volunteers across the world. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2494.94s)]
*  Really? [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2498.94s)]
*  Yes, part-time. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2499.94s)]
*  Full-time, over 6,000 full-time volunteers. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2500.94s)]
*  Wow. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2503.6200000000003s)]
*  Massive projects being run in many places. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2504.6200000000003s)]
*  We are the largest ecological movement on the planet right now. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2507.5s)]
*  We're the largest tree plantation program on the planet right now. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2510.34s)]
*  Replantation? [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2514.7s)]
*  Tree, tree plantation. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2515.7s)]
*  Tree plantation? [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2516.7s)]
*  We just completed about twenty-five or twenty-six days ago, we completed hundred-and-fourteen [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2517.7s)]
*  million living trees. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2522.78s)]
*  Wow. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2524.78s)]
*  So, all this takes a certain amount of work. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2525.78s)]
*  And also our programs are going on all around the world. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2529.94s)]
*  For all this, it takes a lot of management. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2534.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2536.1s)]
*  So, at any given time, I can run fourteen tracks in my mind. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2537.74s)]
*  They're all simultaneously working every building that is designed, I design it. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2539.94s)]
*  From a door bolt to window to everything, I get engaged. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2544.98s)]
*  Yeah, from the windows to the walls, yeah. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2549.54s)]
*  Now, I'm trying to withdraw from those things, but this is how it's been for last thirty, [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2551.94s)]
*  forty years. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2555.74s)]
*  Wow. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2556.74s)]
*  So, people ask me, Sadhguru, so much work, how do you unwind? [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2557.74s)]
*  I said, I don't wind myself up. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2562.54s)]
*  Why should I unwind? [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2564.2599999999998s)]
*  When you wind yourself up and then you want to unwind? [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2567.6200000000003s)]
*  The important thing is this, which unfortunately very sad consequences are happening to people [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2570.58s)]
*  because somewhere they have also realized this. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2577.42s)]
*  The most important thing is, if you want to be stress-free, you must be intoxicated. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2579.7400000000002s)]
*  If you want to be stress-free, you must be intoxicated. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2585.1800000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2587.7000000000003s)]
*  Yes, intoxication does not mean your uncle Jack Daniel. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2588.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2591.86s)]
*  Okay. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2592.86s)]
*  Intoxication means, as I already said, this is the most complex chemical factory. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2594.1800000000003s)]
*  If you create a certain chemistry within you, you are always tone, but not unalert. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2600.94s)]
*  Because we are not against intoxication, we are against incompetence. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2608.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2613.46s)]
*  So, if you take chemicals from outside, either alcohol or drugs or anything, you become incompetent [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2614.46s)]
*  as to what you can do. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2623.14s)]
*  There is no time or room for incompetence in this life because our life is very brief. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2624.66s)]
*  For what… what possibilities human intelligence creates, the… [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2630.7799999999997s)]
*  What possibilities human intelligence can create, for that we don't have enough time. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2639.9s)]
*  If you live to be hundred years, it's too brief. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2645.18s)]
*  But have you noticed this? [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2647.98s)]
*  On a particular day, you're very joyful. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2649.22s)]
*  Twenty-four hours, poof, went off like a moment. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2652.8599999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2656.8999999999996s)]
*  Another day, you're little depressed. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2657.8999999999996s)]
*  One day goes like a eon. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2660.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2661.74s)]
*  So, time is a very relative experience. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2662.74s)]
*  So, intoxication is important, but not from outside. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2665.3399999999997s)]
*  But if just intoxication means you'll sit around, you need exuberance of life. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2669.98s)]
*  If exuberance and intoxication is there at the same time, then you know how to be still. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2677.18s)]
*  Stillness, exuberance, intoxication. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2683.58s)]
*  If these three things happen within you at the same time, life is like a breeze. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2687.46s)]
*  No matter what is the situation, every day there are situations for us. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2693.1s)]
*  Our activity is global and all kinds of troubles because we don't subscribe to any particular… [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2699.1s)]
*  We don't subscribe to any particular religious group or philosophical group or anything. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2706.62s)]
*  So, just about everybody is against us one way or the other. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2710.86s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2713.42s)]
*  We don't ascribe to any political group. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2714.06s)]
*  So, political groups are… everybody thinks I'm their enemy. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2716.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2719.42s)]
*  Though we've not done anything against anybody, but you grow in size without being aligned [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2720.42s)]
*  to anybody, they think you are their enemy. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2727.6600000000003s)]
*  This is the human mentality. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2730.14s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, it's competition. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2731.7400000000002s)]
*  So, constantly something going on. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2732.78s)]
*  So, I created one image. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2734.7s)]
*  I took two-and-a-half years to design this face. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2736.8599999999997s)]
*  Today it's in the Guinness Record as the largest face on the planet. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2739.66s)]
*  The largest face? [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2743.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, yes. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2744.2999999999997s)]
*  This is to acknowledge and also inspire people. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2745.18s)]
*  This is the face of Adiyogi. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2748.62s)]
*  So, when I wanted to design, I set this goal for myself [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2750.62s)]
*  that it should have stillness, intoxication and exuberance on its face. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2753.98s)]
*  I took two-and-a-half years and we made this internally within our center, [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2758.9399999999996s)]
*  our own people, our own engineers. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2763.74s)]
*  Engineers means not qualified, engineered by me. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2765.66s)]
*  We together created this and that face has become like a huge thing in India. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2769.8199999999997s)]
*  It's a destination point right now. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2775.8999999999996s)]
*  Where is it? [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2777.66s)]
*  I want to see it. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2778.22s)]
*  See, here it is. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2779.18s)]
*  Can you make a single large picture? [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2780.06s)]
*  See, that is the face. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2784.9399999999996s)]
*  So… [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2786.7s)]
*  That's beautiful. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2788.06s)]
*  You must tell me whether I've succeeded in stillness, intoxication and exuberance. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2788.9399999999996s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2794.06s)]
*  Yeah, that one. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2795.34s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2796.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2797.34s)]
*  Wow. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2798.22s)]
*  It's hundred-and-twelve feet tall. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2799.98s)]
*  And what did they make it out of? [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2802.54s)]
*  What is it? [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2804.7s)]
*  Is it composed of? [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2805.18s)]
*  This is steel. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2806.2999999999997s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2807.8199999999997s)]
*  And is it individual pieces that were put together like a puzzle? [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2809.58s)]
*  Yes. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2812.86s)]
*  Individual pieces. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2813.98s)]
*  Now, second one we did in Bangalore and that is also of the same size. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2815.66s)]
*  Now others will come of a much larger size. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2821.82s)]
*  The idea is to move human well-being from belief system to philosophies to ideologies [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2823.82s)]
*  to technology. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2830.86s)]
*  Technologies of well-being. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2831.98s)]
*  This is what Adiyogi gave 15,000 years ago, methods and technologies as to how you can [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2833.7400000000002s)]
*  transform yourself. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2839.7400000000002s)]
*  Not philosophies, morals, ideologies. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2840.94s)]
*  Methods and technologies. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2844.06s)]
*  So, though he gave this 15,000 years ago and in every generation, [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2846.3s)]
*  there has been certain number of people making use of it. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2850.86s)]
*  I think the humanity was never ready like today that we are willing to look at technology [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2855.26s)]
*  for as a solution for everything. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2861.42s)]
*  So, that goes for your inner well-being also. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2863.9s)]
*  So, how to be well? [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2867.02s)]
*  There is a technology. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2869.6600000000003s)]
*  When I say technology, the most sophisticated technology on the planet is human mechanism [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2870.94s)]
*  itself, isn't it? [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2876.46s)]
*  The question is you have the most sophisticated technology, but have you read the user's manual? [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2878.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2884.38s)]
*  No, a lot of us haven't and a lot of us don't even think that there… [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2886.3s)]
*  It's like you don't even start to examine the directions, you know. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2889.82s)]
*  It's like you don't even get to know the instrument, but you're just playing music all [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2893.26s)]
*  day and a lot of times it ends up being music you just already heard, you're just repeating [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2897.1s)]
*  other people's music, right? [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2901.1s)]
*  Or you're repeating a… [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2902.3s)]
*  You're not really learning the instrument or creating your own song. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2903.9s)]
*  Music, it's okay, mostly noise. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2907.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, it's a good point. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2909.7400000000002s)]
*  It's a trap of noise. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2912.06s)]
*  How would someone start to get to know themselves, would you say? [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2913.6600000000003s)]
*  I know that's kind of a broad question, but a lot of times we kind of just… [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2918.54s)]
*  We're just living, right? [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2924.7000000000003s)]
*  Instead of like kind of experiencing ourselves, I feel like. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2925.9s)]
*  Especially these days when a lot of our attention is captured so much. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2929.6600000000003s)]
*  But how do we start… how would you suggest that we start to get to know ourselves? [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2934.54s)]
*  See, first thing is to make a distinction between what is you and what is not you. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2939.6600000000003s)]
*  Right now, because you're a podcaster, you can't live without this microphone, right? [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2945.5s)]
*  But is this you? [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2951.5s)]
*  No. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2953.1800000000003s)]
*  No, it's your mic, fine. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2953.6600000000003s)]
*  You wear clothes, is this you? [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2956.38s)]
*  No. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2958.78s)]
*  No. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2959.1800000000003s)]
*  Similarly, you have a body, is it you? [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2961.26s)]
*  Now, that's where it gets a little questionable. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2964.86s)]
*  Let's come to that now. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2967.02s)]
*  You were born like this, same shape and size? [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2968.86s)]
*  Smaller. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2972.14s)]
*  Like this? [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2973.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2973.9s)]
*  A bit. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2974.2200000000003s)]
*  That tiny bit has grown like this. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2975.82s)]
*  How? [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2979.6600000000003s)]
*  By being fed, nurtured, I guess? [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2983.1800000000003s)]
*  Fed. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2986.14s)]
*  Okay, fed. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2986.7000000000003s)]
*  Essentially food. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2987.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2988.54s)]
*  Food means what? [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2990.38s)]
*  It came from the earth, either in the form of vegetable, animal, fish, whatever, essentially [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2991.18s)]
*  it's piece of earth. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2996.62s)]
*  So you put this piece of earth into you and it became like this. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=2998.54s)]
*  So now if this piece of earth that you call as food appears in your plate, [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3003.58s)]
*  you say, this is my food. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3008.22s)]
*  You eat it and then you say, this is me. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3010.06s)]
*  This is like you became a podcaster, after a few years, [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3012.62s)]
*  you start saying this microphone is me. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3015.98s)]
*  Then people know you lost it. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3018.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3020.22s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3022.3799999999997s)]
*  You use the microphone, they may be happy. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3023.1s)]
*  You start thinking I am the microphone or the damn microphone starts speaking by itself. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3025.8199999999997s)]
*  Dangerous. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3031.98s)]
*  Right now that's all that's happening. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3033.4199999999996s)]
*  Body is telling its own story. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3035.74s)]
*  Your mind is telling its own story. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3038.06s)]
*  Your body is just an accumulation of food. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3039.66s)]
*  Your mind is just accumulation of impressions. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3042.2999999999997s)]
*  Both these things, if you use it, wonderful. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3045.02s)]
*  They're great instruments. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3047.58s)]
*  But if they use you, it's terrible. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3049.3399999999997s)]
*  That's all that's happening. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3052.54s)]
*  The bodily needs and psychological needs have captured and destroyed most human beings on the planet. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3053.98s)]
*  They invest their whole life to fulfill their bodily needs [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3063.18s)]
*  or their psychological and emotional needs. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3066.7s)]
*  Yes or no? [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3068.7799999999997s)]
*  Yes, for sure. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3069.66s)]
*  You're not here to just take care of their needs. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3072.62s)]
*  You're here to use them, to ride them towards whatever matters to you. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3074.94s)]
*  But that's not happening because there is no distinction, there is no distance. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3080.78s)]
*  So the simple thing I can do for you is we can teach you a simple method [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3085.26s)]
*  that if you sit here, this is called a Shambhavi, [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3090.86s)]
*  it's part of the Inner Engineering process. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3094.46s)]
*  If you sit here, your body is here, your mind is here, you're little away, little space. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3095.98s)]
*  Once there is a space between you and your body, between you and your mind, [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3103.3399999999997s)]
*  this is the end of suffering because there are only two kinds of sufferings that you know, [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3108.54s)]
*  physical suffering and mental suffering. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3114.14s)]
*  Do you know anything else? [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3115.98s)]
*  No. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3118.54s)]
*  Physical and mental suffering. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3119.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3120.62s)]
*  Once there is a distance between you and your body, between you and your mind, [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3121.02s)]
*  this is the end of suffering. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3125.58s)]
*  Now when there's no fear of suffering, [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3128.46s)]
*  now your intelligence blossoms. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3130.54s)]
*  Now what is being human finds expression. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3133.34s)]
*  When I say being human, there are many ways to go at it. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3136.94s)]
*  Simple thing is we recognize that there are many creatures [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3140.94s)]
*  from microbes to worms to insects to birds, animals, trees, everything, everything. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3147.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3152.7s)]
*  But we call them all creatures. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3153.2599999999998s)]
*  We call them all creatures. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3155.5s)]
*  This is the only creature that we call as human being. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3158.06s)]
*  What this means is this is the only creature which has crossed that line [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3162.94s)]
*  where out of… instead of living out of compulsive reactions, [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3167.98s)]
*  instinctive reactions, this has become conscious enough that it can choose how to be. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3172.94s)]
*  Once you become human, there is a possibility no matter what's happening around you, [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3179.58s)]
*  you can choose how to be. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3184.7s)]
*  All other creatures are in compulsive, instinctive reaction. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3187.3399999999997s)]
*  This one can choose consciously. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3191.3399999999997s)]
*  Unless that happens, the evolution is not complete, I'm saying. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3193.8199999999997s)]
*  This why I said evolution is conscious. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3198.14s)]
*  Right now you sit here. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3200.8599999999997s)]
*  I won't, but I'm saying usually. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3203.9s)]
*  People are doing it to each other. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3206.22s)]
*  Let's say I abuse you. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3207.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3209.02s)]
*  Now you can either react instinctively or consciously respond as you feel fit. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3210.7s)]
*  So in one you will employ your intelligence, in another fit of energy [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3219.3399999999997s)]
*  which will mostly end lost to you, then to the other. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3225.02s)]
*  Right. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3228.7s)]
*  So you're saying that how we can get to know ourselves is by starting with the mind. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3230.06s)]
*  How we can get to know ourselves is by starting to create a little bit of space between… [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3235.26s)]
*  What is you and what is not you. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3240.7000000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3242.38s)]
*  Your body is an accumulation, isn't it? [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3243.5800000000004s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3245.82s)]
*  What you accumulate can be yours, can never be you, isn't it? [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3246.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3249.6600000000003s)]
*  Same goes for your mind. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3251.1000000000004s)]
*  It's an accumulation of impressions. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3252.38s)]
*  So in the night before you go to bed, you try this today. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3254.78s)]
*  Lie down. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3258.6200000000003s)]
*  Everything that you have accumulated in your life, your home, your family, your relationships, [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3259.34s)]
*  including your body, mind, emotion, thoughts, memories, just keep it on the bedside and go to sleep. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3264.94s)]
*  Initially you will find it's kind of confusing, but if you apply yourself, [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3272.06s)]
*  one day when you sleep and wake up, you'll wake up like a flower. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3276.54s)]
*  Really? [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3279.9s)]
*  Yes. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3280.46s)]
*  So you just say, I'm going to leave these things here. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3281.5s)]
*  No, there are meditative processes for that. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3284.94s)]
*  I see. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3286.94s)]
*  Because when you do it intellectually, you get caught up in that only. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3287.74s)]
*  Right. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3290.94s)]
*  Instead of that, there are methods with which if you sit here, [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3291.92s)]
*  clearly there's a distinction between what is you and what is not you. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3294.88s)]
*  As we already went through, suffering happens physiologically and psychologically. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3299.92s)]
*  Once there is a distance between these two, this is the end of suffering. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3305.68s)]
*  Forget about being ecstatic. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3310.88s)]
*  Most people can't be peaceful. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3313.6s)]
*  This happened in Tennessee, a man died. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3316.64s)]
*  And then funeral, everything happened, burial happened, and the wife wanted to [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3319.92s)]
*  buy a tombstone for him. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3324.88s)]
*  Usually these tombs are all coming from India. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3327.12s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3329.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3330.2400000000002s)]
*  Oh, thank you guys, a lot of them are very nice. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3330.7200000000003s)]
*  Most of the granite tombstones are coming from India. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3332.48s)]
*  So the wife ordered from India and she had a plaque written on it and she put it. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3336.32s)]
*  People came and saw it was written there, [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3344.4s)]
*  rest in peace until we meet again. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3347.12s)]
*  That's a lot of pressure. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3353.52s)]
*  You're saying rest in peace till we… you and me meet once again. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3356.4s)]
*  Things will start. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3359.8399999999997s)]
*  Wow. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3364.16s)]
*  So once we start to get to be able to separate… [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3365.8399999999997s)]
*  Now don't blame it on me, I'm asking you. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3372.08s)]
*  Peace, body and accumulation. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3374.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3376.56s)]
*  You're saying it, not me. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3376.96s)]
*  Is your mind an accumulation of impressions? [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3378.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it's just an impression of things. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3380.88s)]
*  Whatever you accumulate, it can belong to you, but can it be you? [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3382.16s)]
*  No. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3386.88s)]
*  That's it, you're saying it, not me, don't accuse me. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3387.44s)]
*  Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, good call, good call. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3390.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, this is me saying it. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3392.88s)]
*  A lot of our capacity these days for consciousness [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3395.76s)]
*  has been hijacked by our phones, right, by cell phones. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3400.32s)]
*  Not really. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3404.0s)]
*  You don't think? [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3404.8s)]
*  No, not at all. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3405.44s)]
*  I find phone as a very blessed instrument. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3407.92s)]
*  Oh, I have to know this then. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3411.76s)]
*  Ha ha ha, because if that damn phone was not there, [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3413.2s)]
*  how many places I will have to hop from here to there, there to there to get things done. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3417.68s)]
*  Today, I wake up in the morning, if I just look like this, [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3423.04s)]
*  in ten minutes I'll handle twenty different issues around the world. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3426.88s)]
*  That's a good point. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3430.88s)]
*  So phone is a tremendously useful instrument. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3432.7200000000003s)]
*  If you don't know how to use it, of course, [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3437.2s)]
*  you can even kill yourself with the phone, take it and bang it on your head, [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3440.48s)]
*  it'll break, not the phone, your head. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3443.84s)]
*  So I'm saying anything that's given to us, it all depends on how we use it. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3447.68s)]
*  Right, just like the baby with the knife. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3452.96s)]
*  Like a man with intelligence, cutting himself into pieces. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3456.56s)]
*  So you just go stand on the street, everybody is driving their dream car, [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3460.48s)]
*  whatever their dream is, they're driving that car. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3464.56s)]
*  Just block the traffic for five minutes, you'll see how they'll freak and fret. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3467.7599999999998s)]
*  They're sitting in the dream car, somebody is giving you an opportunity to stay in the [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3472.88s)]
*  dream car for another five minutes, but they'll freak and fret. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3476.72s)]
*  Because the question is not about the situation. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3480.56s)]
*  No matter where you put them, they will create suffering, [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3485.52s)]
*  because the suffering is not from the situation. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3488.64s)]
*  Suffering is mental condition, isn't it? [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3491.44s)]
*  See, if they have a job, they will stress. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3496.32s)]
*  Fire them, they will stress. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3499.36s)]
*  Get them married, they will stress. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3501.36s)]
*  Stress. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3503.1200000000003s)]
*  Get them divorced, they will stress. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3503.92s)]
*  Make them live, they will stress. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3505.84s)]
*  Make them die, they will stress, all right? [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3507.2000000000003s)]
*  So, stress is not a consequence of what you're doing. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3510.1600000000003s)]
*  Stress is a consequence of you not knowing the nature of how your mind functions, [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3514.96s)]
*  what is needed to make it work well. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3520.48s)]
*  Like these people asking me, [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3522.56s)]
*  Sadhguru, what do you do to unwind? [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3524.0s)]
*  I say, first of all, why do you wind yourself up and then unwind? [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3527.28s)]
*  Yeah, it's most of what we do now. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3533.12s)]
*  It's a lot of like, yeah, it's a lot of feeling like we need to adjust ourselves, right? [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3535.76s)]
*  To what? [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3541.52s)]
*  I don't know, it's a good question. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3542.4s)]
*  But I think that's a lot of the general feeling is like, [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3544.0s)]
*  I need to adjust, I need to affect myself, you know? [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3546.72s)]
*  With… Adjust to what? [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3551.12s)]
*  With what? [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3552.8799999999997s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3553.9199999999996s)]
*  It could be anything. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3554.7999999999997s)]
*  It could be with… it could be with drugs, alcohol, [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3555.52s)]
*  it could be with just scrolling on your phone, [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3559.2s)]
*  it could be with anger. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3562.7999999999997s)]
*  I just think a lot of people, we feel like we need to do something all the time. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3564.8799999999997s)]
*  That means you don't know how to be. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3570.7999999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3572.48s)]
*  Then how do you earn the title human being? [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3573.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3576.0s)]
*  We must strike it off as a human creature. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3577.44s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3579.52s)]
*  It feels like we're getting back more towards creatures, you know? [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3581.92s)]
*  It's important to become a human being because that's a privileged position [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3584.64s)]
*  in the evolutionary process that we've been placed in a place [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3589.52s)]
*  where we can determine the nature of our experience. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3592.88s)]
*  Do you think that a higher consciousness did that? [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3596.56s)]
*  Do you think it was on purpose? [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3600.8s)]
*  See, what is consciousness? [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3602.4s)]
*  Right now, are you conscious? [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3609.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3612.08s)]
*  You're conscious you're here, you're conscious that I'm here, so you're conscious. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3612.4s)]
*  Now the question is only of how conscious, yes? [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3616.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3621.6s)]
*  So nobody is really unconscious. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3622.7200000000003s)]
*  Even in your sleep, you're somewhat conscious. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3624.48s)]
*  Question is how conscious. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3628.0s)]
*  Right now, if you sit here, sit here, sit here another twelve hours, [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3630.08s)]
*  you'll feel a little droopy. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3633.52s)]
*  Then you'll become less conscious, less conscious, less conscious. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3636.16s)]
*  In between, if I say ten words, you'll hear five, then you'll hear two, [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3639.2s)]
*  then you won't hear anything. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3643.92s)]
*  Now how many are you hearing? [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3645.6s)]
*  None. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3647.36s)]
*  No? [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3648.72s)]
*  None. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3649.2799999999997s)]
*  The ten I speak, you're hearing none? [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3650.16s)]
*  Come on. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3652.72s)]
*  Because I'm unconscious then. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3653.68s)]
*  No, no, you are hearing right now. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3655.2799999999997s)]
*  I'm saying as you become less and less conscious, you'll hear less and less. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3657.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3661.8399999999997s)]
*  Right? [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3662.3399999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3662.8399999999997s)]
*  So this is all life is. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3663.68s)]
*  That right now, you know, these lights have been masked a bit. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3666.08s)]
*  Generally, we control them with a little rheostat or a fader or whatever you call it. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3671.2s)]
*  So if you put it at low fade and there's only single light, it lights up only this much. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3676.16s)]
*  Full, the room is dark, just lighting you mildly. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3681.7599999999998s)]
*  Then I think, oh, only this guy is there. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3685.84s)]
*  Because I see only you. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3690.0s)]
*  Somebody lights up the fader a little bit, heightens the voltage. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3692.88s)]
*  Then I see, oh, this is there, that is there, that is there, that person is there, that person is there. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3698.32s)]
*  Light it up fully. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3703.6000000000004s)]
*  Everything that's in this room is crystal clear to me. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3705.04s)]
*  This is consciousness. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3708.32s)]
*  How intense have you kept? [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3710.08s)]
*  If your consciousness has to be like that, you must keep your physiology very clean and vibrant, [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3712.16s)]
*  your mental structure unentangled. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3719.2s)]
*  Unentangled means you are not stuck in your own ideas of what it is. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3721.7599999999998s)]
*  You're using your intelligence to see what is there, not make up what is not there. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3727.2s)]
*  If you… I've said this joke a few times, so you might have heard it, but let me say it. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3732.96s)]
*  See, if you build castles in the air and start believing it's true, then we say you are neurotic. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3737.28s)]
*  But then after some time you start living in that castle, then we say you're psychotic. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3753.44s)]
*  Then somebody comes and collects rent for that castle. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3761.36s)]
*  That's called psychiatrist. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3765.92s)]
*  That's called psychiatrist, that's awesome. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3770.2000000000003s)]
*  Because people are creating this. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3773.92s)]
*  Essentially what is it? [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3775.6800000000003s)]
*  Your intelligence, your memory and imagination going wild, uncontrolled. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3777.52s)]
*  These are the two faculties which are most beautiful things about being human, [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3784.88s)]
*  that you have a vivid sense of memory. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3789.52s)]
*  What happened yesterday is vividly there in your memory. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3791.76s)]
*  Using that we have a fantastic sense of imagination. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3795.2799999999997s)]
*  But these are the two biggest problems that human beings have. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3799.12s)]
*  What is all the human suffering about? [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3802.8799999999997s)]
*  You ask people, they still suffer what happened ten years ago. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3805.7599999999998s)]
*  And they will suffer, that is yet to happen day after tomorrow. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3810.9599999999996s)]
*  What happened yesterday is not alive right now, isn't it? [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3816.16s)]
*  It's only alive in your memory. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3820.16s)]
*  Is it anywhere else? [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3821.8399999999997s)]
*  No, it's gone. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3823.04s)]
*  So you're suffering something that does not exist. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3824.6400000000003s)]
*  What may happen day after tomorrow you're already suffering, does it exist? [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3828.2400000000002s)]
*  If you suffer that which does not exist, what should we say about you? [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3833.36s)]
*  You could be doing better things with your time. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3842.6400000000003s)]
*  What should we say about that person? [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3846.88s)]
*  That you suffer something which is not here. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3850.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's worrying, right? [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3852.88s)]
*  That's called crazy. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3857.44s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3858.4s)]
*  It's turkey time, do you know it? [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3860.8s)]
*  That's pretty good. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3865.92s)]

*  I'd like to take a moment to thank my therapist. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3939.92s)]
*  I don't do that very often. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3942.7200000000003s)]
*  I've had a lot of them so I could, I don't even remember all of them but yeah I guess [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3945.28s)]
*  why I want to thank them for listening over the years. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3950.0s)]
*  You ever been to a therapist? [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3954.7200000000003s)]
*  Maybe you have, maybe you haven't. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3956.0s)]
*  Maybe you think it's not a good thing or it's not cool or whatever. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3958.32s)]
*  Well, I think it's fine. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3963.12s)]
*  When I've had trouble figuring things out, which has been most of the time, therapy, [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=3967.28s)]

*  It's so hard to let go of things from the past, you know. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4014.48s)]
*  Don't, don't let go anything. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4017.28s)]
*  Okay. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4019.04s)]
*  Let go means you're trying to forget it. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4020.4s)]
*  Okay. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4023.04s)]
*  See, the nature of the mind is like this. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4026.88s)]
*  Can we try an experiment with you? [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4030.0s)]
*  Sure. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4032.0s)]
*  All the postures, yogic postures not needed for you. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4034.48s)]
*  Okay. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4036.8s)]
*  I want to get an A. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4039.28s)]
*  This is called a Brahma Mudra. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4040.4s)]
*  All such serious things not needed. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4042.56s)]
*  I'm just going to tell you, close your eyes and don't think of monkeys. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4044.4s)]
*  Do not think of a monkey. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4050.96s)]
*  No monkey. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4053.68s)]
*  No monkeys at all, okay? [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4056.32s)]
*  Okay. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4057.52s)]
*  Only monkeys, come on. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4058.48s)]
*  So I'm saying this is the nature of the mind. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4061.76s)]
*  This, in this mind there is no subtraction and division. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4064.7200000000003s)]
*  There is only addition and multiplication. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4068.88s)]
*  Whatever you try to do, it'll become one more, one more. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4071.28s)]
*  If you try hard, it'll multiply. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4073.92s)]
*  How many monkeys did you see? [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4076.4s)]
*  At least three. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4078.16s)]
*  If you try hard, it'll become three thousand. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4079.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4081.76s)]
*  Well, one of them was calling his friends. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4082.5800000000004s)]
*  So I could tell that it was going to start to grow. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4084.1800000000003s)]
*  So essentially this is the nature of your mind. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4088.5800000000004s)]
*  You cannot forcefully make it do something else. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4091.6200000000003s)]
*  But you can handle it in such a way, the way you want it, only if you're above it. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4095.86s)]
*  Right now you're misunderstanding your psychological process as existential. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4103.860000000001s)]
*  See, what is happening in your mind? [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4109.46s)]
*  Is your psychological drama. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4111.54s)]
*  On what platform is this drama being played? [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4115.14s)]
*  The life that you are. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4117.86s)]
*  Are you alive or no? [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4119.7s)]
*  Yeah, I'm alive. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4121.38s)]
*  You're alive. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4122.18s)]
*  Not because of your thought and emotion. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4123.62s)]
*  Because some European guy said, I think so I exist, so I'm asking. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4125.94s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4130.26s)]
*  Yeah, but as far as I know, I exist. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4131.22s)]
*  You exist, so you may think, may not think. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4133.46s)]
*  Right. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4136.9s)]
*  Like because I exist, I may fly my hand or I may keep it here. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4137.46s)]
*  Similarly, I may fly my mind or keep it here. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4142.34s)]
*  But because most people have become so compulsive, they think because they think they exist. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4145.86s)]
*  No, because you exist, you may think if you wish. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4150.9s)]
*  But that option and that choice has been given away by most people. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4155.06s)]
*  Thought is like a diarrhea. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4159.14s)]
*  It's happening all the time. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4160.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4161.94s)]
*  Not by choice. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4162.42s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4165.3s)]
*  So, the important thing to understand is that your mental and emotional stuff is psychological drama. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4166.58s)]
*  It is happening on the stage that we call as life. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4176.58s)]
*  So, suppose your drama, one act is not going the way you think it should go. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4180.82s)]
*  We should change the act, end the act and change the act, not burn down the stage. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4186.82s)]
*  Right. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4193.219999999999s)]
*  Right now, we're burning down the stage with mental illnesses, suicide. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4194.52s)]
*  These things are growing in such a scale, no more it's individual problem. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4199.16s)]
*  It's like a global problem. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4204.04s)]
*  We are in the process of launching what is called as Miracle of Mind, [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4207.240000000001s)]
*  that we are launching a very intelligent app, which will provide simple tools for people [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4211.400000000001s)]
*  to just twelve, fifteen minutes a day. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4219.08s)]
*  What's it called? [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4221.639999999999s)]
*  Miracle of Mind. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4223.48s)]
*  Medical of Mind? [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4224.44s)]
*  Yep. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4225.24s)]
*  Because mind is a miracle, isn't it? [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4226.5199999999995s)]
*  Every miracle that we have affected has only happened out of our mind, [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4228.759999999999s)]
*  but we think it's a problem. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4233.959999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's true. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4236.839999999999s)]
*  We're treating our mind like it's a problem, huh? [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4237.4s)]
*  It is not a problem. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4239.639999999999s)]
*  I haven't even thought about that. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4240.759999999999s)]
*  It's like we're treating the greatest thing that we have as if it's a problem all the time. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4241.799999999999s)]
*  Because it's a sharp knife. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4247.48s)]
*  If you had the brain of an earthworm, you would need marijuana, drugs, alcohol to be peaceful. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4250.28s)]
*  You would anyway be peaceful. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4256.28s)]
*  It can even be achieved now. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4258.28s)]
*  If you remove half your brain, you will sit here peacefully. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4259.719999999999s)]
*  Destroying the possibility and then being peaceful is meaningless. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4265.16s)]
*  Keeping all the human possibility full on and then you're peaceful and joyful, [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4271.48s)]
*  then it's wonderful. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4276.36s)]
*  You destroy it, you soak it in alcohol. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4278.04s)]
*  You sit in one corner, you smoke and sit in one corner and you think you're peaceful. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4281.16s)]
*  It's meaningless peace. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4285.16s)]
*  That way death is better, death is peaceful. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4286.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4288.5199999999995s)]
*  Rest in peace till we meet again. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4289.0s)]
*  Oh, that sounds pressure some even. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4294.12s)]
*  You just died and you already have an appointment on the books. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4295.88s)]
*  That's the part that sounds pressure some to me. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4299.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, we have a ton of anxiety. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4302.12s)]
*  That's a buzzword that a lot of people use nowadays is anxiety, anxiety. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4303.88s)]
*  Become a qualification. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4307.96s)]
*  Is what? [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4309.56s)]
*  For a lot of people, I'm distressed and disturbed and I'm anxious has become a qualification. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4310.76s)]
*  They think it's a qualification. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4316.4400000000005s)]
*  They don't understand it's destruction of human nature, [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4317.88s)]
*  destruction of human possibilities, isn't it? [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4323.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4326.12s)]
*  Oh, for sure. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4326.4400000000005s)]
*  I think it's definitely something that's very common now. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4327.8s)]
*  I mean, I buy into it as well. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4330.68s)]
*  It's like, you know, I feel like I'm dealing with depression or I'm anxious. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4334.12s)]
*  I hear a lot of younger people say anxious though. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4338.68s)]
*  That's one thing I hear them say a lot. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4341.320000000001s)]
*  Like I have anxiety and I never heard that when I was growing up, [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4342.76s)]
*  I never heard anxiety that much. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4346.280000000001s)]
*  You hear it a lot now. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4347.8s)]
*  We had no clue. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4351.0s)]
*  We didn't know how to spell anxiety when we were young. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4352.04s)]
*  Now, the thing is there are many, many factors to this. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4356.52s)]
*  There are sociological factors. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4359.08s)]
*  There are other factors like there is not enough nutrient in the food. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4361.64s)]
*  There's not enough strength in the soil. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4365.88s)]
*  So there's not enough strength in the food that we consume. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4367.72s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4371.4s)]
*  A lot of the soil we're using now I know is, [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4371.72s)]
*  it's just soil we've used so many times. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4374.04s)]
*  It's getting, there's nothing left in it, you know, [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4375.96s)]
*  and we're growing our food out of it. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4379.08s)]
*  Nothing left means what is not left. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4380.28s)]
*  See, we must understand this. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4382.12s)]
*  If you take that much of sand and add enough organic content to it, [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4383.48s)]
*  it becomes soil. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4388.44s)]
*  Okay. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4389.5599999999995s)]
*  If you take rich soil and take off all the organic content from it, [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4390.5199999999995s)]
*  it becomes sand. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4394.599999999999s)]
*  So essentially it's the organic content. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4396.5199999999995s)]
*  What does the organic content do? [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4398.839999999999s)]
*  It feeds the organisms. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4400.839999999999s)]
*  What are these organisms? [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4403.0s)]
*  There are trillions of species of organisms. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4404.839999999999s)]
*  In a handful of soil, [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4407.48s)]
*  there could be anywhere between six to nine billion organisms, [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4409.48s)]
*  a handful of soil. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4415.96s)]
*  Fifty to seventy thousand species of organisms in one handful of soil. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4417.88s)]
*  But we are starving them to death. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4423.48s)]
*  They are the foundational life. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4425.96s)]
*  Even in your body, sixty percent is organisms. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4427.96s)]
*  Only forty percent is your parental genetics. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4432.12s)]
*  Sixty percent is other organisms. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4436.68s)]
*  So these organisms are the foundational life for everything. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4439.32s)]
*  For a plant, animal, human being, for everything, [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4443.4s)]
*  this is the foundational life. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4445.88s)]
*  They are dying in trillions per day or per hour because there's no food. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4447.72s)]
*  Why there's no food? [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4453.72s)]
*  If organic material has to come into soil, [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4455.72s)]
*  there are only two sources. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4458.12s)]
*  It's so simple, but unfortunately it's… [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4459.400000000001s)]
*  the world doesn't even to get it. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4462.2s)]
*  There are only two sources. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4463.8s)]
*  You can't make it in the factory. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4465.56s)]
*  You can't do something else. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4468.12s)]
*  You can't bring it from Mars. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4469.96s)]
*  Only two sources. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4471.72s)]
*  Green litter from the trees and animal waste. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4473.240000000001s)]
*  These are the only two sources of organic material on the planet. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4476.84s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4480.360000000001s)]
*  Tell me in your farm, the farms that we see in the world today, [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4480.92s)]
*  where are the trees, where are the animals? [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4484.52s)]
*  No, tractor is doing all the job the animal used to do, [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4487.88s)]
*  but the tractor doesn't shit. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4490.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4491.72s)]
*  Oh, yeah, we need a tr… yeah, we got to turn… yeah. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4493.72s)]
*  We got to put a digestive system on a tractor. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4496.52s)]
*  You… if there's no organic content, the organisms will start dying. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4500.12s)]
*  See, the minimum organic content that is needed to coil soil as soil, [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4506.76s)]
*  according to UN agencies, is three percent. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4512.5199999999995s)]
*  Three percent. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4516.28s)]
*  That's how much soil needs to be organic content? [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4517.16s)]
*  That is the minimum organic content that should be there in the soil. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4519.32s)]
*  But the shame is not a single nation, [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4523.88s)]
*  not even one single nation on this planet has three percent average organic content [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4527.320000000001s)]
*  across their lands, not even one. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4533.320000000001s)]
*  The highest is 2.4 percent in northwestern Europe, [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4535.8s)]
*  southern Europe is 1.1 percent, [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4539.96s)]
*  United States is 1.25 percent, [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4542.280000000001s)]
*  Africa is 0.03 percent. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4545.0s)]
*  Oh, man. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4548.280000000001s)]
*  India is 0.62 percent. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4549.4800000000005s)]
*  This is death. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4552.120000000001s)]
*  So, with most agencies are saying we only have another sixty harvests left, [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4553.32s)]
*  not years, harvests left. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4559.400000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4561.4800000000005s)]
*  Because there'll be nothing in the soil to make any more food. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4562.84s)]
*  I wonder if… because sometimes I wonder if like some of these like forward thinkers [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4565.24s)]
*  and these larger corporations that buy up a lot of the land and farmland, [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4570.84s)]
*  if they know that, you know, if they're like planning ahead, you know. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4574.28s)]
*  Like instead of fixing the problem though and… [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4577.8s)]
*  They're trying to exploit the problem. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4579.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4581.88s)]
*  Like instead of getting our soil better, people would rather, [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4582.92s)]
*  well, let's find something we can eat that we don't have to grow in the soil, you know. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4586.6s)]
*  See, there is no such thing as growing elsewhere. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4591.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4595.16s)]
*  You understand? For all that the basis… [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4595.66s)]
*  Oh, I believe it. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4596.76s)]
*  The basis is in nature, all right? [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4597.64s)]
*  We can reproduce that, we can use it in so many different ways. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4600.92s)]
*  But you can't completely produce something out of nothing. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4605.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4608.28s)]
*  There's no such thing. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4609.0s)]
*  So, organisms are not just for food. Our very body is organisms. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4609.88s)]
*  Right now, why all these immune issues, psychological issues is, [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4614.04s)]
*  the life material is collapsing. But the first one that collapses is the psychological, [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4618.6s)]
*  the software. The software is collapsing. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4624.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4626.84s)]
*  Hardware is also becoming weak. Our immune systems are not as they were some time ago. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4627.34s)]
*  Well, in this, apart from the soil being like that, there is a lot of alcohol usage, drugs, [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4634.04s)]
*  especially in teenage period when people are growing up, alcohol, this, that, smoke… [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4641.56s)]
*  Oh, yeah, drank. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4646.76s)]
*  Various things just weakening. There are substantial studies to show, [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4647.080000000001s)]
*  during the growing period, those who consume these things, their ability to get into depressive [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4651.96s)]
*  states, their ability to lose balance over their mind is very, very high. In UK, so many studies [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4658.68s)]
*  have been done which clearly show this, that the amount of depression which is there in those who [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4664.6s)]
*  abuse these things when they were very young, when the brain was still growing. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4669.8s)]
*  That's Ireland. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4673.240000000001s)]
*  Hmm? [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4674.84s)]
*  That's mostly Ireland probably. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4674.92s)]
*  No, no, UK generally. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4676.4400000000005s)]
*  Is it all of them? [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4678.4400000000005s)]
*  London is a hotbed for everything. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4680.04s)]
*  Yeah. But so obviously, so if this, so we, so, man, there's a lot of things to think about. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4683.0s)]
*  So, we're not getting the proper nutrients that we need. So you think that that contributes to [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4689.4800000000005s)]
*  some of the anxiety that people are dealing with these days, like younger generation. I guess it [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4695.72s)]
*  makes sense if they're not properly nourished, then how would you be able to create a stable [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4699.88s)]
*  environment inside of yourself, right? [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4706.68s)]
*  One hundred percent. See, many studies shows this. If you, in 1920s, that's a little over a century [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4708.68s)]
*  ago, if you ate one California orange, what you got from that? Today, if you have to get the same [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4717.160000000001s)]
*  amount of nutrition, you have to eat eight oranges. Have you eaten eight oranges any one day? [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4724.4400000000005s)]
*  No. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4729.8s)]
*  You will turn orange. Your blood won't be red, it'll become orange. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4730.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, man, I would hate eating eight oranges. It would take you half the day. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4736.44s)]
*  It would take you an hour and a half. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4741.08s)]
*  See, United States, west of Mississippi, these are all grasslands, the prairie. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4742.44s)]
*  We're ploughing them deep, fourteen, fifteen inches with a machine, all right, with a tractor. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4748.76s)]
*  The ones who plough the grassland, the reason why it's grassland, why there are no trees in [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4754.92s)]
*  that part of the country, because it's windblown. My experience, people, they have traveled with me [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4759.72s)]
*  when I rode motorcycle across the western part of United States. The biggest problem is the wind. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4766.68s)]
*  I'm riding a heavy motorcycle which is over three-hundred-and-sixty kilograms, but it goes [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4773.64s)]
*  like this, because the wind is so strong. That's why there are no trees, because it's windblown. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4777.8s)]
*  So, in this, if you plough fourteen, sixteen inches, all the soil, topsoil is flying away. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4785.320000000001s)]
*  You've heard of the dust bowls of the past. Even recently it happened in Illinois. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4791.16s)]
*  So, I was just talking to somebody and they're saying, they're so excited about… You know, [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4796.280000000001s)]
*  I don't remember the number exactly. They said, so many million tons of soil landed up in New York [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4801.0s)]
*  City, the tall New York buildings topped so much soil. I said, what foolishness is this? [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4806.84s)]
*  You're… You're just looking at the million tons of soil which the New York City building stopped. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4814.28s)]
*  What about probably a trillion tons of soil which went into Atlantic? [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4820.759999999999s)]
*  Because you ploughed the prairie so deep, it's a grassland. Grassland means it's windblown. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4827.5599999999995s)]
*  TK W [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4833.08s)]
*  Windblown. It's just blowing it off. Yeah, I think it's just… We don't care enough, [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4833.32s)]
*  I guess. I don't know. It's tough. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4838.44s)]
*  No, everybody says I'm generation Z. So, they think they're the last generation. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4839.96s)]
*  Right. They're passing along the problem. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4844.92s)]
*  No, no. See, when you say Z, that means the final thing, right? [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4846.76s)]
*  Oh, it's true, huh? [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4850.68s)]
*  This is it. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4853.240000000001s)]
*  Generation Z means I'm the final generation. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4854.52s)]
*  I didn't even think about that. Yeah, I guess we don't have a strategy for after this. That's [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4858.2s)]
*  what it sounds like. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4863.0s)]
*  No, we can still turn it around. I don't know if you have heard of the safe soil movement. See, [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4864.360000000001s)]
*  here I am. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4868.28s)]
*  Safe soil. No. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4869.88s)]
*  Save our soil. Save soil. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4871.5599999999995s)]
*  This is save soil. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4873.24s)]
*  Okay. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4874.2s)]
*  As a part of changing the policy because this can't be fixed. See, if I say this, [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4875.4s)]
*  especially in California, I started speaking and they say, okay, I'll go and fix my kitchen garden. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4881.48s)]
*  You fixing your kitchen garden is very cute. I appreciate that. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4886.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4889.5599999999995s)]
*  But it's not a solution. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4889.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4891.639999999999s)]
*  Solution will happen only when the policy changes as to how we use our soil. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4892.2s)]
*  Soil is not a resource. Soil is a legacy that's come to us from previous generations. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4898.200000000001s)]
*  It's our business to see that it goes to next generation. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4904.280000000001s)]
*  If not better condition, at least the way they gave it to us. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4908.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4911.400000000001s)]
*  At least that much. But we are finishing it off. All right? [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4911.72s)]
*  Fifty-two percent of the agricultural soils are already degraded. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4916.04s)]
*  And why do you think that's just a mindset that we have? I guess like you're saying, [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4921.160000000001s)]
*  it's like we've reached Generation Z, maybe nobody's thinking about soil as a legacy, [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4924.6s)]
*  they're just thinking about what can I get from it now. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4929.160000000001s)]
*  See, let me tell you this. I'm not a scientist. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4930.6s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4936.84s)]
*  People have… But I've spoken to various agro-sciences conferences and stuff. They asked me, [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4937.72s)]
*  Sadhguru, how do you know? I said, I'm a worm. I'm like a worm, I'm crawling on this land as a life [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4943.72s)]
*  and I know what's happening to me. By being in various situations, what happens to me, [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4950.6s)]
*  I'm conscious and sensitive enough to know what's happening to me. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4955.88s)]
*  So, because we are not living in this universe, we are manufactured in the universities, [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4960.28s)]
*  unfortunately these days, only information, no experience of anything. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4965.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4969.8s)]
*  There is no experience of anything. If you go out, most people don't know what's the temperature. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4970.2s)]
*  They will look in their phone, what is the temperature? [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4976.36s)]
*  Arey, your body is there. You must know what's the temperature. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4979.0s)]
*  Yeah, you're a thermostat. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4982.679999999999s)]
*  But they don't even know whether they are hungry or not. They will look at how many calories they [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4985.32s)]
*  ate today. I'm saying information, no profoundness of experience about anything, from simple things [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4990.2s)]
*  to complex things, I'm saying. Because of this, we have arrived at this, we do one thing and forget [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=4998.839999999999s)]
*  the other thing, all bits and pieces of doing things. So, you won't believe it in 20... [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5004.84s)]
*  What is COP26? Glasgow, 2022. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5013.16s)]
*  Same soil is 22, no. Yes, 2022 January is Glasgow in, you know... [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5023.8s)]
*  Scotland? [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5031.72s)]
*  Scotland. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5032.28s)]
*  Oh yeah, I like Scotland. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5032.68s)]
*  You like Scotland. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5034.04s)]
*  Yeah, I like Scottish people. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5034.84s)]
*  You like... You're a golfer? Are you Scottish? [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5036.28s)]
*  I'm not a good golfer yet, but I like the Scots, just because they've just been through a lot. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5039.24s)]
*  Because you don't understand what they say. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5046.76s)]
*  It helps. You can just kind of go like this, you know, it's good. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5048.44s)]
*  They speak the same language so differently. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5053.88s)]
*  Yeah. I got to visit India one time, I went to Madras, I think. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5057.32s)]
*  I'll tell you about India later. We'll finish this soil business. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5062.4400000000005s)]
*  So, in Glasgow, COP26 happened, which is all the countries meet, the nation's representatives meet. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5065.88s)]
*  COP26 it's called? [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5071.8s)]
*  Yeah. This is a UN agency. It's called UNCCC for climate and whatever. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5073.16s)]
*  So, a lot of... All the environment ministers, some prime ministers, presidents, everybody are [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5079.8s)]
*  there for this meeting. So, I... After this is over, fifteen days they met and this is over this, [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5084.52s)]
*  I asked some of the environment ministers, what have we decided about soil? [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5091.88s)]
*  They said, soil? What about soil? I said, no discussion about soil. She said, no. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5097.240000000001s)]
*  Those who are there for full fifteen days, they're saying the word soil was not mentioned. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5104.6s)]
*  Wow. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5108.360000000001s)]
*  Then I started a campaign. I rode a motorcycle from London to southern India, [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5109.82s)]
*  twenty-seven nations, thirty thousand kilometers in hundred days. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5115.66s)]
*  Man! [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5120.299999999999s)]
*  They thought I will die, but I didn't see here I am. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5121.5s)]
*  You got some wind burn, huh? [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5123.66s)]
*  Even now I came on a motorcycle. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5125.58s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, really? [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5127.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5129.099999999999s)]
*  Oh, that's awesome. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5129.599999999999s)]
*  From MacMillanville. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5130.299999999999s)]
*  So, you guys did that to raise awareness? [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5132.94s)]
*  Not awareness, to change the policy in the nation. So, we signed member... [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5135.82s)]
*  Memorandum of Understanding, MOUs with various countries and European Union has [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5139.9s)]
*  done good work in terms of changing policies, but still it is too slow. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5145.0199999999995s)]
*  See, the political process in a democracy is so slow, you will be... I mean, this is not a [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5150.219999999999s)]
*  popular thing to say. We ran these campaigns across. In hundred days, we touched 3.9 billion [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5157.74s)]
*  people on the planet. Wow. Through social media and everything. With that kind of... Once the [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5165.98s)]
*  democratic leaders see that kind of support, they want to do something about it. So, Europeans [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5171.82s)]
*  started talking about it and making some changes. It's yes to be implemented, at least beginning to [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5178.219999999999s)]
*  enter their policy. Well, in Middle Eastern countries, they are doing a lot, but they are [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5184.3s)]
*  in a bad land, you know, it's a desert land. They are trying to do their best. India, a lot of changes [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5190.860000000001s)]
*  have happened. Implementation still slow, but at least in law, changes have happened. But you won't [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5196.3s)]
*  believe, we ran a very low-level campaign in China, but the Chinese are doing the best in this. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5202.860000000001s)]
*  Really? [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5211.1s)]
*  Yes. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5211.66s)]
*  They have a lot of soil land over there. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5213.04s)]
*  The thing is, I'm not speaking against democracy, but democracy has to be... [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5215.76s)]
*  Democracy is a wonderful thing when people are conscious and focused towards one thing. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5223.44s)]
*  When democracy becomes a business by itself, well, to get any simple thing done, it'll take [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5228.08s)]
*  ten years of debate and discussion and political bombing against each other. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5235.76s)]
*  What needs to happen in the country is forgotten. The individual parties and stuff goes crazy. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5242.240000000001s)]
*  So, China doesn't have that problem. They converted millions of [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5248.16s)]
*  hectares of land or millions of square kilometers of land into, you know, tree-based agriculture and [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5253.200000000001s)]
*  other things that we recommended. Because there, if somebody, one person decides, it just goes. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5259.12s)]
*  It happens. It's not as much red tape. Everything here has gotten so many legal issues. Everything [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5265.36s)]
*  is a nightmare to get done here. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5270.0s)]
*  Not just here, everywhere, all democracies, you have the best policy. I will go to the court, [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5271.04s)]
*  put one hook on you. You run on the same spot for next three years. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5277.679999999999s)]
*  It's like this. You may not have the endurance. To get rid of the hook, [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5285.44s)]
*  you may go in a different direction. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5289.2s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. It's more a thing of endurance here. It's like you have to, it's just like [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5290.72s)]
*  to make a change. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5295.84s)]
*  Everywhere in all democracies, unfortunately, people have learned how to misuse democracy. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5296.72s)]
*  It is the most wonderful thing that people can decide who should rule, how wonderful it is. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5302.320000000001s)]
*  But we have started misusing the mechanics of democracy. Everybody is understood. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5307.68s)]
*  It's no more the spirit. It's the vulgar description of democracy, which is working. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5312.72s)]
*  The spirit of democracy is what's best for the people should happen. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5318.96s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, it's definitely, it's gotten very confusing. But I wonder if some of that is just [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5322.24s)]
*  a side effect of democracy over time and of capitalism over time. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5330.16s)]
*  Everybody figured out how to win an election. That's the whole thing. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5333.52s)]
*  Yeah. It's true. It's a good point. One of the things that I think sometimes we're missing in [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5336.24s)]
*  the world these days is, you know, people say connection a lot of times. And I don't know if [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5344.88s)]
*  that's necessarily true because in some ways, like you're saying, there's more connection than [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5348.48s)]
*  ever. But what about like love and stuff like that? Do you think that love is a choice that we make, [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5352.639999999999s)]
*  or do you think there's something more cosmic involved in it? Like when people choose to love [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5362.719999999999s)]
*  one another. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5367.599999999999s)]
*  Be your neighborhood girl sent by Cosmos cosmic agents. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5368.08s)]
*  Yeah, that would be nice. You could just wish on a star for a date. But yeah, do you think that [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5372.48s)]
*  there's something because love feels different whenever you're in love with someone, right? [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5380.639999999999s)]
*  So when you said whenever, that means it's not happening all the time. It happens once in a way. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5385.839999999999s)]
*  Right. It's a leap year. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5391.919999999999s)]
*  So right now, how much radical view are you ready for? [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5393.839999999999s)]
*  I'll take it all, I think. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5402.4s)]
*  Really? [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5404.16s)]
*  I mean, depends on how weird we're trying to get. But yeah, I mean, I'm into some stuff. Yeah, [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5404.799999999999s)]
*  I'll listen at least. I'll start there. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5408.4s)]
*  Okay. So one way to look at it is the emotion of love. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5410.88s)]
*  Initially, it got the way people know it. It's just generally love means romantic love. All right? [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5416.96s)]
*  That is initiated by a rush of hormone in your system. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5427.759999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5433.12s)]
*  Essentially, I would say your intelligence got hijacked by your hormones. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5434.08s)]
*  That's fair. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5439.12s)]
*  So till yesterday, that's quantity little girl who in the neighborhood, [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5440.32s)]
*  suddenly she got a few bumps on her body. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5444.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5447.2s)]
*  Suddenly it became a whole cosmos. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5447.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5449.76s)]
*  You can't take your eyes off her. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5450.48s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5453.5199999999995s)]
*  And don't think of all that now, I'm just telling you. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5455.44s)]
*  Okay, yeah. Yeah. I keep my hands like this. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5457.5199999999995s)]
*  So I'm saying just the hormonal rush in you suddenly makes you see everything completely [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5461.679999999999s)]
*  differently. A little while later, if you look back, it may look stupid. All right? [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5469.76s)]
*  But at that moment, anyway, we're talking about love, not about hormones or sexuality, [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5477.6s)]
*  but that instigate that fires it. If you look at it by nature, what is nature's intent? [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5484.400000000001s)]
*  Why is it getting you so excited about the neighborhood girl? Because it wants you to [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5491.280000000001s)]
*  reproduce. If it doesn't fire something like this, there will be no next generation of people. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5495.68s)]
*  So nature needs it. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5502.0s)]
*  Yes, it's the instinct of the species that it wants to survive. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5503.360000000001s)]
*  We may play all kinds of games with it, but essentially it wants you to reproduce. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5507.360000000001s)]
*  Leave that aside. We've kept that as a choice now. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5513.76s)]
*  We want to reproduce or not is a choice. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5516.72s)]
*  But nature is pushing you in that direction. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5519.4400000000005s)]
*  So, leaving that aside, now love means you long for somebody. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5521.6s)]
*  What is the longing? You want to become one. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5530.320000000001s)]
*  See, right now, you're breathing. I'm checking on you. You're breathing. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5534.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Yes. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5538.8s)]
*  Don't just say yes to me. Are you really breathing? You notice it. Yes. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5540.8s)]
*  Now this is a small plant, but let's say that's a little bigger thing. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5545.68s)]
*  What the tree is exhaling, you're inhaling. What you exhale, the tree is inhaling. Am I correct? [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5549.6s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5557.200000000001s)]
*  Is it a fact or fiction? [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5557.92s)]
*  It's shotgun on each other. Yeah, it's good. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5558.96s)]
*  It is fact or fiction? [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5560.64s)]
*  Correct. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5561.68s)]
*  Fact. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5562.320000000001s)]
*  Fact. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5563.120000000001s)]
*  So, you and the tree, for example, it's like one half of your lungs is hanging out there. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5564.96s)]
*  You're not really separate from microorganism to a plant, to a tree, to an animal. This is one thing. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5571.360000000001s)]
*  This is one big phenomenon. It's only in your mind, intellectually, you're separating these things. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5578.72s)]
*  Why? We already went through this. You want your mind to be sharp. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5585.360000000001s)]
*  Sharp instrument is good for cutting. I'll give you a knife. You can dissect whatever you want, [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5589.84s)]
*  but you want to stitch your clothes. If you stitch your clothes with a knife, what'll happen? [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5598.8s)]
*  That is how the modern fashion has arrived. Everybody's got torn pants. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5604.0s)]
*  It will ruin it. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5608.0s)]
*  No. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5609.12s)]
*  It's new. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5609.68s)]
*  Now it would look good. Now it would look good. If you stitch your… Yeah, nowadays it would really [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5610.24s)]
*  look pretty fire, I guess. Right? [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5616.0s)]
*  Not that it will look good, it's torn. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5619.52s)]
*  It's torn. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5621.4400000000005s)]
*  If you try to stitch with a knife, it'll go into ribbons, all right? [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5622.16s)]
*  Okay. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5626.16s)]
*  So, right now it's the same thing. Your mind is a sharp instrument. It is good for dissection. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5626.8s)]
*  It is not good for unifying everything. Unifying does not mean you and me have to sit [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5632.8s)]
*  together and put the universe together. It is anyway one large phenomena. It is you who [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5637.6s)]
*  is separating it. If you stop separating it, it'll be one. When you say love, it's a strong emotion [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5642.64s)]
*  to make those two pieces of creation which have become separate, to make them one. We're trying [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5651.360000000001s)]
*  hard. Good, instead of being separate, it's a good emotion, at least is bringing you close to one [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5658.240000000001s)]
*  person. Otherwise, you are a island by yourself. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5665.76s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah, you're an island boy after that. Yeah, you're… Oh, yeah, yeah, [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5668.96s)]
*  you want to find someone else, right? So, it feels like that makes sense. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5673.84s)]
*  Essentially, this life is happening is a large phenomena. We don't get it. But actually as a [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5678.24s)]
*  life, we are just a pop-up on this planet. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5684.400000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5686.56s)]
*  All the countless number of people who walked this planet before you and me, where are they? [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5687.76s)]
*  They're all topsoil. This will also become topsoil, you just have to wait for some time. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5692.48s)]
*  So, now it is all one life. In your mind, you separate it. Then in your emotions, [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5700.16s)]
*  you try to stitch it, which is a struggle. Generally, for most people, [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5706.879999999999s)]
*  moments of great joy and fulfillment will happen in love. Rest of the time, it's only anxiety and [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5713.679999999999s)]
*  pain most of the time. But for those few moments, they are willing to go through all the pain, [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5720.16s)]
*  because those few moments are so precious. But I'm saying, why are there so few moments? [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5726.08s)]
*  This love is about for a moment, you felt like you're one, all right? Either physically, [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5733.92s)]
*  mentally, emotionally, sometimes even energetically, you felt like you're one. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5740.8s)]
*  I'm saying you're anyway one. If you remove the barriers of your mind, [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5746.4800000000005s)]
*  you're anyway one, you can sit here dripping ecstasy, not love. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5751.200000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5756.080000000001s)]
*  You'll seek love, because you think love will bring blissfulness and ecstasy. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5756.96s)]
*  That's the truth, yeah. You think it's going to bring something different. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5761.84s)]
*  Yes. But I can teach you a simple way. You can sit here with eyes closed [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5764.080000000001s)]
*  or with eyes open and be totally blissed out. People ask me, [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5769.68s)]
*  Sadhguru, of all these things that you're doing, what is your greatest achievement? [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5774.0s)]
*  I say tears. So what tears? Why? Today, millions of people across the world, [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5778.16s)]
*  if they close their eyes in the morning to do a simple practice, tears of ecstasy every day drips. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5785.12s)]
*  Wherever I go, whichever part of the world I go, not a day passes for me without me seeing [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5791.6s)]
*  tears of love and ecstasy. This is the greatest boon you can have in this world, [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5798.0s)]
*  where everybody is trying to pull and push each other. Every day you're meeting people [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5804.48s)]
*  who are in tears of love and ecstasy. So this is just this. For all human experiences, [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5808.88s)]
*  whatever it is, pleasant, unpleasant, love, hate, anger, agitation, tranquility, beauty, [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5816.16s)]
*  everything, agony, ecstasy, everything comes from within you, isn't it? [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5822.48s)]
*  Yes. Now the question is, do you want an external stimulus or can you consciously do it yourself? [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5826.320000000001s)]
*  What do you drive? I drive a cyber truck. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5836.56s)]
*  You're on the cyber? I know. I just got it. It's a long story. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5842.4800000000005s)]
*  Somebody brought it to gift it to me. I said, no, it looked like cardboard to me. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5846.72s)]
*  And overall, I belong to a generation where we have admired, enjoyed and cotton infused [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5851.679999999999s)]
*  with internal combustion engines. Yeah, you love them. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5861.5199999999995s)]
*  Wow, heartbeats with it. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. When you get some of [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5865.36s)]
*  those old engines, I really, really dig them. But one thing I like about it is I don't have to stop [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5869.679999999999s)]
*  to get gas. That's one thing I do like about it. But go on, carry on. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5874.0s)]
*  So this whole process of blissfulness is the goal. See, people may call it whatever. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5879.76s)]
*  Here they will call it love, relationship, this one, drink, drug, everything, each two words, [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5889.44s)]
*  the highest level of pleasantness that a man can experience, isn't it? Or no, nothing. Here you [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5895.52s)]
*  become hopeless. You say, I'm going to heaven. What is your idea of heaven? The most pleasant [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5900.96s)]
*  place. Yes or no? Yes. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5905.92s)]
*  If right from your childhood, you've been told heaven is the pleasantest, beautiful place [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5909.92s)]
*  on the in the universe. So you want to go there. Suppose right from your childhood, I told you, [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5916.56s)]
*  God lives in heaven, but it's a horrendous place. You want to go there? [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5922.08s)]
*  Not as much. No, I'll pray from here only. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5926.56s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. I don't want to go there. I'll send an email. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5928.8s)]
*  Yes. So essentially, your search for pleasantness is fundamental. So all these addictions of alcohol, [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5932.320000000001s)]
*  drugs, everything is that finding a quick fix, that longing to have a most pleasant experience of life, [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5941.12s)]
*  you're looking for a quick fix. The question is, it's not a moral issue. It's just that it makes [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5951.12s)]
*  you less. When I say it makes you less, you know, I've been invited to all this in India, [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5957.52s)]
*  they keep inviting me to this. There I have conferences called Under 25. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5962.64s)]
*  Okay. Under 25 years of age, they have their own conferences and I'm always invited. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5966.96s)]
*  I'm under 25. They think I am. So I go there and in Bangalore city, over 40,000 people [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5973.280000000001s)]
*  are in an open ground. It's not legal there, but the place is the strong smell of marijuana. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5982.400000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah. No, it's not legal. Yeah. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5991.4400000000005s)]
*  Everything, everybody is smoking. No, no, no, no, Sadhguru. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5994.88s)]
*  Oh, you have so much influence in the government. Why can't you make marijuana legal? [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=5999.280000000001s)]
*  I said, why just marijuana? We'll make cocaine legal, meth legal, fentanyl legal. Tell me what [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6004.88s)]
*  else? Give me a list, I'll make everything legal. Why you want to make it legal? Because you want to [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6010.4s)]
*  smoke up and go to the university. They're all students. Oh, yeah. You got to get high and go [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6018.08s)]
*  to university. That's what... In India, the term is smoke up. Smoke up. Smoke means tobacco. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6024.4s)]
*  Yeah. Smoke up means that. Yeah. So you want to get high. So first of all, when you smoke, [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6031.36s)]
*  what happens? You get kind of disconnected. All right. Right now, what happens essentially is, [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6040.4s)]
*  your faculties come down. So you want to go through a surgery, let's say you have a brain surgery [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6048.48s)]
*  and the neurosurgeon comes smoked up. Yeah. You want the surgery? Not now. Not with that guy. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6056.0s)]
*  Yeah. Not with that guy. I'll let the nurse do it. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6062.32s)]
*  Because you understand clearly, when you do this, your faculties come down. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6067.36s)]
*  Even your cognition comes down, whether you see it or not, faculties come down for sure. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6073.599999999999s)]
*  So putting your faculties down, you're calling it high. I said, at least first, when you smoke up, [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6078.719999999999s)]
*  you say, I'm down. Don't say I'm high. Yeah. Because your ability to do things, [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6086.16s)]
*  ability to perceive everything has gone down. Yeah. The way to be high is, if I can see things [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6090.8s)]
*  that you can't see, if I can hear things that you cannot hear, if I can experience things that you [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6097.360000000001s)]
*  cannot experience, this is high, isn't it? Yeah. You lower tone down the life and you say you're [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6103.12s)]
*  high. Don't do this. At least you say, I'm low, we'll make it legal. Yeah. At least for them, [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6108.4800000000005s)]
*  we're working from an honest place. Yeah. Yeah, man. People get pretty high. It's outlawed in India, [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6114.400000000001s)]
*  it's illegal. See, India is a place where it's available almost everywhere, but nobody cared [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6120.96s)]
*  to smoke because everybody in America is smoking, they all started smoking now. Ah, I see. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6127.2s)]
*  Otherwise, if you go into the valleys, just about anywhere, if you just do like this in the plants, [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6132.5599999999995s)]
*  the resin will be on your hands. Yeah. The places where we track, the marijuana grows like seven [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6137.36s)]
*  feet tall. Wow. We are walking through that taller than us. Oh, I'd have my mouth open and [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6144.4s)]
*  round went through. I would love that. One of the problems we see or seeing a lot here in USA is [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6149.839999999999s)]
*  pornography, young people getting addicted to pornography. Is that something that's happening [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6159.5199999999995s)]
*  in India? Do you guys see that there or is it not something? Not that big I see it, but I hear it's [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6164.0s)]
*  rampant and it's causing many, many issues and problems. Yeah, because it hijacks a lot of like [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6171.6s)]
*  your masculinity, you know, it hijacks a lot of your energy it feels like. It's not about hijacking [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6178.4800000000005s)]
*  energy fundamentally. See, women have been fighting for their liberties or women's liberation as such. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6183.360000000001s)]
*  This is the end of women's liberation. If pornography becomes the normal viewing thing for [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6193.200000000001s)]
*  everybody, a woman is just an object. All right. There is no more, a woman is not worth connecting [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6197.76s)]
*  to being one with, knowing to, you know, making an attempt to know her, all this is not needed. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6205.4400000000005s)]
*  She's just a doing thing. Yeah. So if we value women, this should be brought down. But now it's [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6212.64s)]
*  spread like anything somebody was telling me seventy percent of the content on the internet [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6220.88s)]
*  is pornography. Yeah. I don't know if that number is correct, but that's what they're saying. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6224.88s)]
*  Yeah, it's just unfortunate. Is it the responsibility of a government to prevent that or is it the [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6230.72s)]
*  responsibility of humans to not want to view it? Does that make sense? See, most humans are not [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6236.72s)]
*  it beings. So society, government plays a role in who they are. If there are no laws, a whole lot [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6245.28s)]
*  of people will kill themselves driving crazy, for example, or taking all kinds of drugs already. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6255.04s)]
*  I think in twenty twenty three, there have been over a hundred thousand overdose deaths, I believe [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6262.639999999999s)]
*  in United States itself. Yeah. So human beings are not yet in that state where you can just leave [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6267.52s)]
*  everything to them. Some things need to be regulated. Some regulation should be there, [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6275.6s)]
*  but it's not for me to say that because it's so pervasive. I only hope people get tired and [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6282.64s)]
*  disgusted with those things, hopefully. But when twelve, thirteen year old children look at it, [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6290.4s)]
*  they are completely taken by these things. It rules their mind. I know, you know, [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6298.4s)]
*  thousands of people are in touch with me on a daily basis. I have met people, many of them crying and, [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6304.24s)]
*  you know, asking for help that they started watching pornography when they were eleven, [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6311.36s)]
*  twelve. They can't even look at their mother simply as their mother. Without shame or [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6316.24s)]
*  discomfort. Discomfort because they only see the body parts of her. So I'm saying if you want to [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6324.08s)]
*  reduce a woman to body parts and you're born out of her, all right, you don't fall out of a sky, [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6331.04s)]
*  you're born out of a woman, when you degrade her, you degrade all life, human life. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6337.84s)]
*  So there are many implications to that, which unfortunately today it's commerce. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6342.72s)]
*  They don't care what is the impact as long as they're making money. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6350.400000000001s)]
*  Dr. Justin Marchegiani Yeah. Is it the same in India as it is in other countries? Is that popular? [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6353.360000000001s)]
*  Is it…? Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6358.320000000001s)]
*  I hear in rural India is… it's just taken the youth totally. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6359.08s)]
*  Dr. Justin Marchegiani Oh, it's unfortunate. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6363.92s)]
*  Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6367.28s)]
*  Sadhguru, a couple of other things that I wanted to get to. What about if you had to suggest to [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6369.599999999999s)]
*  someone to read a certain text every day, right? Or if people only had the ability to read one text, [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6374.96s)]
*  what is a text that you recommend, that you would recommend for people to read? [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6381.12s)]
*  Dr. Sadhguru Only one text means just how many lines? [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6385.92s)]
*  Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan Just as many lines, but it's only one book. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6388.24s)]
*  Dr. Sadhguru Only one book. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6390.879999999999s)]
*  Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan Yeah. Do you have one that you think would be most helpful to people? [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6392.16s)]
*  That may be a lame question. It's no, it's not a good… it's a good question. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6396.0s)]
*  Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan See, [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6398.719999999999s)]
*  this is once again thinking that information is a solution for everything. With more and more [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6406.639999999999s)]
*  information, tell me people have become better or worse? [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6416.4s)]
*  Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan I think people have become worse. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6418.96s)]
*  Situations have become better, but people have become worse, isn't it? [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6422.64s)]
*  Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan Right. People have become less of themselves. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6426.24s)]
*  Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan When I say worse, I'm not saying anything else. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6428.72s)]
*  I'm saying they're more distressed. Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6433.6s)]
*  I'll agree with that. Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6435.68s)]
*  But situations, never before in the history of humanity, situations were this good for us, [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6437.4400000000005s)]
*  isn't it? Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6442.96s)]

*  but human beings are becoming more distressed simply because too much information, with [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6476.96s)]
*  information we create conveniences, comforts, but no profound experience of life. So this is not in [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6484.96s)]
*  a good place. If this is not in a good place, let's say we take you to heaven, I can arrange it for you. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6493.76s)]

*  or just people want to figure out a way to be more at peace. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6747.2s)]
*  Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan So they need to understand this. This is not [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6750.24s)]
*  a religion, this is not a philosophy, this is not an ideology, this is a method, it's a technology. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6752.24s)]
*  Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan Okay. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6757.04s)]
*  Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan What happened was, it's now 1982 means what? [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6757.5199999999995s)]
*  Forty-two years ago. One afternoon I'm just sitting on a small hill in Mysore. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6762.4s)]
*  Suddenly I burst into an ecstatic state, where every cell in my body is dripping ecstasy. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6769.84s)]
*  I think it lasts just for five, ten minutes. Then when I come back to my normal thing, [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6777.84s)]
*  about four-and-a-half hours have passed. For the first time in my life, tears of ecstasy flowing. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6782.32s)]
*  Then I… At that time, I'm a super-skeptic. Super means super, super-skeptic I am. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6789.36s)]
*  Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan Yeah. [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6796.0s)]
*  I don't believe anything other than what I can see, that kind of mindset. [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6796.639999999999s)]
*  So I shake my head and think, what's happening to me? Maybe I'm going off my rocker. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6801.28s)]
*  Then I talk to my closest friends, something is happening to me. If I close my eyes, [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6807.36s)]
*  I'm just blown away. Hey, come on now, what did you pop? Did you find the mushrooms in the hill? [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6811.2s)]
*  What happened to you? All this. Then there was nobody to relate with. In about six weeks, [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6816.96s)]
*  this became my normal experience that if I sit in one place, if I close my eyes and I think it's [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6823.44s)]
*  two minutes, seven, eight hours are poof, gone. Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan Wow. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6829.599999999999s)]
*  Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan Like that. Because when you're ecstatic, [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6832.32s)]
*  a year will feel like one moment. It just poof goes away like that. Then I realized, what is this? [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6836.96s)]
*  I started, you know, looking at this, what is it that's happening to me? [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6846.639999999999s)]
*  Then I realized if I can keep my hands off my psychological activity and simply sit here, [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6851.2s)]
*  because you're going into this posture all the time. That's what it means. You're trying to [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6857.44s)]
*  keep yourself off your psychological activity. If you take my hand off that, suddenly [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6862.32s)]
*  an ecstatic wave happens in my system. Then I thought, this is it, I've discovered this. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6869.84s)]
*  And then I thought, who wouldn't want this? I couldn't think of one guy who doesn't want this. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6876.64s)]
*  Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan Yeah. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6881.68s)]
*  Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan Who wouldn't want to be blissed out? [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6882.0s)]
*  Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan Yeah, I'm ready. Yeah, I'm in it. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6883.68s)]
*  Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan Then I sat down and made a plan. I was twenty-five years of age. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6885.4400000000005s)]
*  I made a plan that in the next two-and-a-half years, I will make the whole world blissed out. [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6889.76s)]
*  Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan Yeah. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6896.64s)]
*  Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan And that day the population was [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6896.96s)]
*  somewhere around five-plus billion. And I made a plan how to hit the geography of the world. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6900.16s)]
*  And in two-and-a-half years, I can do it. Forty-two years, look at me. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6906.32s)]
*  Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan Yeah, it's taking a while, huh? [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6911.839999999999s)]
*  Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan So today they are saying we are touching [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6916.4s)]
*  two, three billion people, whatever. But that's not my idea of humanity. Humanity is now eight [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6919.12s)]
*  point four billion people. So I am only trying to… I know that I will die as a blissful failure. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6924.32s)]
*  Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan Yeah. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6931.2s)]
*  Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan Okay? I will die blissfully, but I am a failure [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6931.68s)]
*  because I thought I'll do this to the whole humanity. I am only getting a little bit of [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6935.84s)]
*  percentage. So I'm still trying to improve my percentage. So for all the people who subscribe [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6940.16s)]
*  to you, we'll give them fifty percent off. Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6946.8s)]
*  Oh, that's very sweet of you. Thank you. I'm going to… I'll make sure to subscribe too, [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6949.44s)]

*  happened to people is not because it's difficult. They don't have focus towards that. Their focus [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6969.44s)]
*  is somewhere else. They think if I get this, my life will be better. If I get that, my life will [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6975.04s)]
*  be better. No. If you are better, whether you get something or not, you're still better. That's all. [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6980.56s)]
*  Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan Yeah, yeah, I love that. I love the fact that [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6986.64s)]
*  if you are taking care of you the best you can, then no matter… [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6989.360000000001s)]
*  Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan No, don't say taking care. [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6992.56s)]
*  Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan Okay. [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6993.76s)]
*  Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan If you're not messing, everything is [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6994.080000000001s)]
*  taken care of. Tell me what's the problem with your intelligence. It's the most fantastic thing [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=6995.92s)]
*  on this planet, isn't it? We don't know. We are always thinking somebody else… some other planet, [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7002.0s)]
*  the aliens are more intelligent. Maybe they are, we don't know. We don't know for sure. A lot of [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7007.44s)]
*  people see them in their dreams and whatever. Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan Yeah, they're perverts [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7013.36s)]
*  too though and yeah, you never see an alien… Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan But the most fantastic [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7018.0s)]
*  thing that you have seen is human intelligence. Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan Yeah. [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7022.0s)]
*  Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan But that intelligence is cutting you into pieces. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7024.24s)]
*  You can call this stress, anxiety, madness, whatever you want. Essentially, human intelligence [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7027.759999999999s)]
*  is cutting you up into pieces. Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7034.08s)]
*  It's happening these days for sure. Why is it? Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7035.92s)]
*  One thing as I said, it's a sharp instrument and you don't know how to deal with it. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7040.16s)]
*  Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan Right. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7043.92s)]
*  Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan There are many ways to look at it. [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7044.24s)]
*  See, one thing that's happened is what we call as science today, unfortunately, has become [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7048.5599999999995s)]
*  purely utilitarian, not subjective. In the name of objectivity, in reaction to the religious dogmatism, [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7054.5599999999995s)]
*  science has taken a very dry route where they won't find any life. It's a very, very dry route. [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7064.32s)]
*  Everything is objective. But you're subjective, isn't it? Your experience of life is very subjective. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7072.48s)]
*  Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan Yeah, for sure. [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7080.8s)]
*  Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan There's no value for that. So, we will… [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7081.6s)]
*  with objectivity, essentially it means we use our intelligence to dissect. Now, Theo, [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7084.0s)]
*  I really want to know you. I'll arrange a dissection for you so that I can explore you [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7090.64s)]
*  and really know you, who you are. Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7096.400000000001s)]
*  That's not the same, though. Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7098.96s)]
*  No, I just have bits and pieces. Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7100.72s)]
*  Yeah. You don't have the whole truth. Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7102.400000000001s)]
*  Yes. If you embrace something, you may know something. By dissection, you will have information [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7104.8s)]
*  without knowing anything. This is what we are doing to the world. We are using the human [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7111.92s)]
*  intelligence purely as a logical scalpel to cut everything into pieces. That's why nothing is of [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7116.24s)]
*  value. Nothing is of profound experience. People can't do anything with deep sense of involvement [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7123.28s)]
*  because they are well-informed, that's what they think. They are not well-informed. They are just [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7130.24s)]
*  having bits and pieces of memory. You wipe out their memory, they don't know anything, all right? [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7137.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, there's not a lot of concepts. It's more just random facts. [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7143.44s)]
*  Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan No, they may even have concepts, [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7146.88s)]
*  but there's no experience. Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7150.24s)]
*  Right. There's no… Yeah, we're not… We're hearing things and reciting them, [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7152.16s)]
*  but we're not understanding them. Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7157.5199999999995s)]
*  See, there is a difference between… You read in the school textbook, the planet is round. [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7159.5199999999995s)]
*  Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan Yeah. [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7164.639999999999s)]
*  Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan But you took a voyage and went around the [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7165.12s)]
*  planet and came. Or you went to the moon and looked down, that planet is round. Very different. [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7168.0s)]
*  Profound experiences and information are two different things. Information is useful [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7174.0s)]
*  to fix the outside situation, but the inner situation is never fixed with information. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7180.16s)]
*  It needs a profound experience, it needs access. That access is missing because information is [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7186.24s)]
*  always coming from outside. Right now, people have seen the whole cosmos through their phone screen. [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7192.8s)]
*  It gives them a false sense that they know whole cosmos, but all they have seen is the phone screen. [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7198.96s)]
*  Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan Yeah. [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7205.92s)]
*  Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan So, because of this, the basic mental structure, [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7206.4800000000005s)]
*  how it works, what happens… See, for example, how our mental structure is formed, [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7211.52s)]
*  everything that's there in your mind today, whatever content you have in your mind today, [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7219.76s)]
*  is something that you imbibe from outside. Yes? How did you imbibe? By seeing, by hearing, [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7225.28s)]
*  by smelling, by touching. Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7232.16s)]
*  That's how you imbibe, yeah. Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7234.24s)]
*  That's how you imbibe through five senses. But today, most of it you're imbibing only as [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7235.5199999999995s)]
*  information, not even as impression. Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7241.759999999999s)]
*  Right. Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7244.96s)]
*  At least the impressions together would become an experience, but today it's purely information. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7246.08s)]
*  Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan Just the frosting, no cake. [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7252.0s)]
*  Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan Is that make sense or no? [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7253.52s)]
*  Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan No.... Oh, okay, like that. I thought just [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7256.040000000001s)]
*  cake. No go… No icing. Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7260.72s)]
*  Oh, I see you're saying… What about the other? Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7262.400000000001s)]
*  Without icing, cake is actually a good thing. It's bread. [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7265.120000000001s)]
*  Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan But this, we're just getting the icing. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7268.160000000001s)]
*  Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan Yes. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7271.200000000001s)]
*  Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan We're not getting any of the substi inds [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7271.6s)]
*  Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan Yes. No substi inds. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7273.4400000000005s)]
*  Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan No nourishment. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7275.76s)]
*  Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan Good. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7276.64s)]
*  Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan Just surface which looks good and when you stand on it, it cracks. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7277.06s)]
*  So all this is metaphorical, but let's come down to the simple fact. [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7281.52s)]
*  The simple fact is this, as we went through this monkey experiment, if you say, I don't [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7286.72s)]
*  want something, only that happens. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7292.040000000001s)]
*  To this mind, somebody tells you what is good, what is bad. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7294.56s)]
*  Don't think about bad things. [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7298.240000000001s)]
*  Well, that's a full-time job right now. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7299.52s)]
*  So, without understanding the mechanics of how human system functions, how human intelligence [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7303.240000000001s)]
*  is formed, these things are happening. [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7311.0s)]
*  In the yogic system, we see the human mind as sixteen parts. [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7313.44s)]
*  These sixteen parts can be seen as four segments. [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7319.96s)]
*  These four segments are, one is called buddhi, which literally means intellect. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7323.98s)]
*  Another is called ahankara, which means identity. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7329.36s)]
*  The third is called manas, which means memory. [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7333.36s)]
*  The fourth is called chitta. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7337.92s)]
*  We'll come to that. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7340.32s)]
*  Buddhi means intellect. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7342.719999999999s)]
*  It's a front end of your intelligence. [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7344.599999999999s)]
*  Buddhi. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7346.2s)]
*  Like Buddhism almost. [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7347.2s)]
*  It actually comes from that. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7349.0s)]
*  See, if you are above, buddhi means intellect. [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7350.36s)]
*  Dha-da means one who is above. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7354.96s)]
*  One who is above his intellect is a buddha. [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7358.639999999999s)]
*  Yes, that's not his name. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7362.12s)]
*  His name is Gautama Siddhartha. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7366.32s)]
*  He became a buddha. [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7368.6s)]
*  That means he went above his intellect. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7371.12s)]
*  That is, your intellect is normally cutting the world into pieces. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7374.72s)]
*  Whatever you look at, it wants to dissect. [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7379.24s)]
*  So, he went above that and looked at the world the way it is. [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7382.28s)]
*  So, he's a buddha. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7386.44s)]
*  So, he's a buddha. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7387.44s)]
*  So, he's not the only buddha. [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7388.44s)]
*  There have been thousands of buddhas and still are. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7390.16s)]
*  But the fact is that you go above your intellect. [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7393.3s)]
*  Yes. [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7395.64s)]
*  So, buddhi is the front end of your intelligence or your mind. [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7396.64s)]
*  It is a cutting edge. [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7400.96s)]
*  It is very, very needed to be in function for you to be surviving in this world. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7403.160000000001s)]
*  Right, because you have to understand and process and make choices. [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7409.280000000001s)]
*  You have to make… [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7412.06s)]
*  When you came here, you have to discriminate and decide whether to sit in that chair or [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7413.06s)]
*  this chair, otherwise you'll go and sit on this. [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7417.6s)]
*  Yes. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7419.88s)]
*  So, intellect is very vital for your survival. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7420.88s)]
*  When you're in the survival mode, it is most important. [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7424.52s)]
*  But a cutting instrument doesn't give you a full picture of anything. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7428.6s)]
*  For example, all the information that intellect has, the data it's collected is from the [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7432.400000000001s)]
*  five senses essentially. [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7437.84s)]
*  What you see, hear, smell, taste and touch. [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7440.68s)]
*  Right now can you see my hand? [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7443.72s)]
*  Yes. [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7445.160000000001s)]
*  You see this part, but you don't see this part. [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7446.160000000001s)]
*  If you see this part, you can't see this part. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7449.320000000001s)]
*  It's not just the hand. [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7452.36s)]
*  Even if you take a grain of sand, if you see one side, you can't see the other side. [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7453.6s)]
*  This is the nature of our senses. [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7458.0s)]
*  They give all half information. [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7459.88s)]
*  All the information that you're gathering today in the form of information is all half [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7462.88s)]
*  because human senses perceive like this. [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7468.44s)]
*  Now, with all these half pieces, you make a picture and you think that is it. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7471.76s)]
*  So what happens with intellect is suppose I give you a million piece jigsaw, you got [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7476.16s)]
*  five pieces together and you say, wow, it's a bear. [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7482.36s)]
*  But there are million pieces, you got only five. [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7487.28s)]
*  So all the information that you have, all the libraries on the planet, if we grind it [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7490.24s)]
*  and put it in your head, still what you know is a minuscule in this universe. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7494.72s)]
*  Yes or no? [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7501.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7502.0s)]
*  It's just a minuscule. [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7503.0s)]
*  With this minuscule, you're always making conclusions. [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7504.28s)]
*  So the important thing to understand is intellect is a front-end defender. [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7509.8s)]
*  It's a knife, a sword in your hand. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7514.52s)]
*  You need to use it discreetly in such a way that you don't go on slaughtering people. [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7516.92s)]
*  You can kill people with your intellect, you know. [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7522.32s)]
*  Human intelligence is killing people, isn't it? [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7524.84s)]
*  Yeah, all the time, always has. [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7527.2s)]
*  Yes. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7529.2s)]
*  So this is a front-end. [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7530.4s)]
*  But now the knife by itself is not dangerous or useful or anything. [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7532.76s)]
*  It depends the hand which holds it, which makes it what it is. [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7537.599999999999s)]
*  So the next one is called ahankara. [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7541.48s)]
*  The word ahankara literally means identity. [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7543.96s)]
*  Ahankara, the sense of identity. [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7546.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7549.32s)]
*  So right now, if you think I'm this, whatever is your identity, let's say you think I'm [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7550.32s)]
*  American. [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7557.44s)]
*  Now you're willing to live for America, die for America, fight for America, do whatever [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7559.08s)]
*  for America. [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7563.28s)]
*  Or your identity is something else, it's racial or it's religious or it is something else, [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7564.28s)]
*  gender, whatever. [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7570.24s)]
*  What you're identified with, your intellect will do everything possible to protect that [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7572.28s)]
*  identity. [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7577.92s)]
*  This is the only way the mind works. [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7581.48s)]
*  See, right now, your brain cells, my brain cells may not be very different. [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7583.68s)]
*  But you think I'm American. [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7588.72s)]
*  So your intelligence will do everything for America. [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7590.96s)]
*  Suppose I think I'm something else. [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7593.6s)]
*  My intelligence or my intellect will work only for that because it functions from the [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7596.1s)]
*  data that you have gathered. [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7600.360000000001s)]
*  The data is in memory. [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7602.92s)]
*  See, the third dimension of the mind is called manas, which is a silo of memory. [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7604.400000000001s)]
*  Here there are eight types of memory. [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7610.240000000001s)]
*  There is elemental memory, there is evolutionary memory, there is genetic memory, conscious [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7612.64s)]
*  and unconscious levels of memory, articulate and inarticulate levels of memory. [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7617.7s)]
*  There are eight different types of memories. [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7622.62s)]
*  So you are, this memory is what is firing your intellect. [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7625.36s)]
*  Many times you may see or understand things that you have never been exposed to because [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7630.34s)]
*  in your evolutionary memory and in your genetic memory, there are so many things. [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7636.44s)]
*  There are ways to consciously activate them, but at least even unconsciously they are finding [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7641.54s)]
*  expression in so many ways. [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7646.34s)]
*  So many human beings act as if they know something in a given moment, though they have never [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7647.820000000001s)]
*  been exposed to that because there are other forms of memory within us. [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7652.620000000001s)]
*  Whatever has happened to the human species, in some way it is within us. [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7657.3s)]
*  Whatever has happened to our forefathers, it's some way is within us. [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7661.06s)]
*  Whether you find excess or not is a different matter. [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7665.160000000001s)]
*  So the silo of memory, let's analogy, we'll keep the knife analogy. [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7667.9800000000005s)]
*  Front is the buddhi, which is a sharp knife. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7673.820000000001s)]
*  The sharper it is, the better it is. [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7675.74s)]
*  Okay, that's your intellect. [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7677.66s)]
*  And the hand that holds it, which is ahankara, are the identity. [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7679.0199999999995s)]
*  Now this is one thing we have neglected hugely in this world. [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7683.099999999999s)]
*  In India, there is a tradition, unfortunately, these things have been given up in the name [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7687.58s)]
*  of being modern, all right? [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7692.099999999999s)]
*  Because our education is as Western as it is here, there also today. [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7695.139999999999s)]
*  Otherwise, before starting education for a child, as a rule, there was no education [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7701.54s)]
*  till a child becomes twelve years of age, because we always saw one's body and brain [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7708.58s)]
*  needs to mature to a certain point before you burden it with education. [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7714.74s)]
*  Today, we want to start at three years of age. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7719.9s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7723.7s)]
*  To teach a kid hand Spanish or whatever when they're seven months, it's just ridiculous. [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7724.7s)]
*  It's like, what are we doing? [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7728.58s)]
*  So twelve years we start education. [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7730.18s)]
*  Before we start the education, because education is seen as an empowerment for a human being, [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7733.780000000001s)]
*  before you empower a human being, first thing is he has to identify himself with the cosmic [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7738.700000000001s)]
*  identity. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7744.780000000001s)]
*  First thing is you change your identity from being a son of your parents or daughter of [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7747.4800000000005s)]
*  your parents, from being a part of your caste or a creed or a religion, you say my identity [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7753.1s)]
*  is with the cosmos. [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7758.02s)]
*  I am a product of this cosmos. [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7759.02s)]
*  It's called aham brahmasmi. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7761.42s)]
*  That means I am that which is the ultimate. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7763.02s)]
*  So first this identity, then education. [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7766.900000000001s)]
*  Because education is empowerment, if limited identity is empowered, it will do terrible [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7770.400000000001s)]
*  things. [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7775.740000000001s)]
*  See, you can… [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7776.740000000001s)]
*  You know, we have a program in India and also we did some in Pennsylvania and Kentucky. [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7777.740000000001s)]
*  This is called as Inner Freedom for the Imprisoned. [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7782.5s)]
*  Our programs are mandatory in southern India. [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7785.22s)]
*  It's done wonders for these unfortunate, you know, convicts who are locked up for very, [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7789.06s)]
*  very long period. [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7794.26s)]
*  Some of them on the death row for fifteen, twenty years in India, they don't get hanged, [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7795.32s)]
*  but they're on the death row going for one more appeal, one more appeal, those kind of [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7799.86s)]
*  people. [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7803.06s)]
*  So, thousands of people, they have transformed their lives with these programs. [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7804.06s)]
*  Within the prisons we conduct these things. [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7808.74s)]
*  So anyway, so when we are doing this, what I realize is the only problem with him is [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7811.7s)]
*  limited identity. [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7818.4s)]
*  He is intelligent, actually he is far more resourceful than the people, fools who are [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7819.4s)]
*  outside on the street. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7825.839999999999s)]
*  I find them very vibrant, high energy individuals. [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7827.599999999999s)]
*  Only problem is their identity is so small. [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7832.36s)]
*  My well-being is everything. [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7836.16s)]
*  I want this to be well. [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7839.4s)]
*  I don't care what happens to that. [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7840.4s)]
*  But suppose somebody says, oh, this is my family. [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7842.92s)]
*  What did they do? [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7845.92s)]
*  They included that also into their identity. [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7847.08s)]
*  And suddenly the question of doing any harm to them doesn't arise because this is yours. [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7850.64s)]
*  I see what you're saying. [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7856.72s)]
*  They look at it more of a worldly, they have more of a worldly understanding that they're [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7857.88s)]
*  part of something bigger than just them. [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7861.2s)]
*  No, no. [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7862.76s)]
*  I'm saying let's go one step at a time. [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7863.76s)]
*  You are an individual. [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7865.28s)]
*  Then you raise a family. [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7867.04s)]
*  Suddenly your wife and your children or your husband and your children or whatever, suddenly [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7868.96s)]
*  they become a part of your life. [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7873.0s)]
*  You're even willing to die for them. [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7875.28s)]
*  Now you say, I belong to this community. [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7878.64s)]
*  Now you're willing to live and die for that community. [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7881.400000000001s)]
*  Now you say, I'm this nation. [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7883.64s)]
*  You're willing to live and die for that nation. [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7885.4400000000005s)]
*  So what is this? [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7888.400000000001s)]
*  You're enlarging your identity. [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7889.400000000001s)]
*  I see. [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7890.96s)]
*  So all crime on this planet, all evil on this planet, all genocides on this planet, all [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7892.4800000000005s)]
*  the most horrendous things that human beings have done is a product of limited identity. [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7898.96s)]
*  That makes perfect sense. [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7904.72s)]
*  I'll take the worst example. [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7907.64s)]
*  I'm always known to take the worst examples. [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7909.44s)]
*  The worst example you can take is Adolf Hitler. [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7913.4800000000005s)]
*  What is wrong with this man? [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7918.0s)]
*  He's super competent. [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7920.36s)]
*  There are many people, thousands and thousands of people with the same mindset, but fortunately [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7923.32s)]
*  they're incompetent. [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7931.0s)]
*  The guy is too good an organizer and competent. [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7933.719999999999s)]
*  So suddenly he will multiply, all right? [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7939.16s)]
*  See human beings cause pain to each other in so many different ways, but this is an [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7943.719999999999s)]
*  industrial level of suffering he creates. [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7948.719999999999s)]
*  What is that? [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7952.16s)]
*  Not because he has a different intent. [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7953.32s)]
*  There are so many people with the same intent, but it's a different level of competence. [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7955.12s)]
*  So when this happens, what do you think? [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7960.9s)]
*  Human competence becomes a curse. [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7963.8s)]
*  That should never be so. [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7967.5199999999995s)]
*  Human intelligence and competence should never be a curse. [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7969.48s)]
*  It's the greatest boon that we have. [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7972.5599999999995s)]
*  More intelligent and more competent people we create, the better the world should be, [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7975.3s)]
*  but it's not so. [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7980.9s)]
*  The more intelligent and more competent people come, our bombs become bigger, our weapons [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7982.56s)]
*  become more deadly and our things. [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7988.320000000001s)]
*  Why? [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7991.68s)]
*  Limited identity. [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7992.68s)]
*  So all the horrible things that you see people do to each other is a consequence and a product [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=7994.84s)]
*  of limited identity. [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8000.72s)]
*  So first thing is to enhance the identity because how sharp this knife is, the sharper [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8002.4400000000005s)]
*  it becomes, more important the hand is steady, isn't it? [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8008.52s)]
*  If this is a wonky hand, sharp knife is a dangerous damn thing. [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8013.92s)]
*  That's all that's happening. [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8019.160000000001s)]
*  And the memory is a silo of memory. [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8020.660000000001s)]
*  There is plenty there. [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8022.64s)]
*  Plenty means the whole evolutionary process of who we are is captured there. [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8024.64s)]
*  Genetic memory, evolutionary memory, elemental memory is all there within this. [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8029.900000000001s)]
*  So we can get back to a good level quickly. [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8034.4400000000005s)]
*  Oh yes. [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8036.52s)]
*  If only if you remove the impediments that you have created, essentially which is limited [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8037.92s)]
*  identity that you think I am this, this is mine, that is not mine, this is me, that is [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8042.56s)]
*  not me, this whole thing. [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8048.32s)]
*  If you take away this limited identity, you… right now we are speaking only intellectually, [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8050.8s)]
*  but this can be done experientially. [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8056.18s)]
*  Say right now I spoke about this Shambhavi Mahamudra. [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8057.64s)]
*  If you sit here, your body is here, your mind is here, you are little away. [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8060.76s)]
*  When we sit here, that's your body, this is my body. [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8067.0s)]
*  Till we are buried in the same symmetry, we remain separate. [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8070.36s)]
*  Someday you live fifty years more than me, all right? [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8077.32s)]
*  Someday we'll be connected again. [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8080.8s)]
*  If we buried in the same soil, we will be connected. [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8082.28s)]
*  Even now we are connected, we are not seeing it, that's all. [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8085.68s)]
*  Connection does not mean emotions. [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8089.04s)]
*  Connections does not mean imagination. [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8091.28s)]
*  As life, we are connected, all right? [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8093.0s)]
*  Because what you think is me as a physical self and what I think as me as a physical [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8097.200000000001s)]
*  self is from the same soil, isn't it? [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8102.92s)]
*  That's a good point, yeah. [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8105.080000000001s)]
*  This happened, this happened in 2060. [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8106.88s)]
*  You know, 2060? [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8109.080000000001s)]
*  2060? [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8110.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8111.6s)]
*  We are not there yet. [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8112.6s)]
*  You are not there. [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8114.64s)]
*  This happened in 2060. [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8118.6s)]
*  A few scientists wanted an appointment with God, they got it. [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8120.76s)]
*  They went there and then they said, [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8126.16s)]
*  Hey old man, you've done pretty well with creation. [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8128.96s)]
*  But everything that you can do, we can also do. [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8133.08s)]
*  Time you retire. [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8137.4s)]
*  God said, Oh, is that so? [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8140.84s)]
*  What is it that you can do? [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8143.0s)]
*  He said, Look at this. [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8144.599999999999s)]
*  They picked up some soil, they did it, made a a wig form like a human baby and they did [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8146.96s)]
*  all kinds of things. [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8153.48s)]
*  Within ten minutes, it came alive and started crying, the baby. [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8154.5199999999995s)]
*  God said, That's very impressive. [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8159.879999999999s)]
*  But first get your own soil. [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8161.879999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8164.679999999999s)]
*  It's, yeah. [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8165.679999999999s)]
*  Fundamentally, it's the same material, all right? [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8168.679999999999s)]
*  But this psychological thing of you is you, me is me, all right? [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8174.16s)]
*  For physical function, this is important. [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8179.959999999999s)]
*  That is you, this is me. [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8182.419999999999s)]
*  That is your body, this is my body. [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8184.46s)]
*  We respect these boundaries. [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8186.24s)]
*  That's your mind, this is my mind. [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8188.36s)]
*  Here and there we may overlap, but still that's your mind, this is my mind. [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8190.28s)]
*  But there is no such thing as that is your life and this is my life. [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8194.36s)]
*  Life is one big phenomena. [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8199.56s)]
*  You captured some, I captured some. [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8202.14s)]
*  Now we have a way how you can capture more life. [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8204.84s)]
*  If I capture more life than you, suddenly my life is enhanced. [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8210.82s)]
*  Not only in my experience, in everybody's experience, other people also will feel, wow, [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8216.38s)]
*  what a life is. [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8222.18s)]
*  More enhanced. [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8223.18s)]
*  Not because of what you do, simply you're more enhanced. [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8224.18s)]
*  Right now you can enhance your body by building muscle. [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8228.56s)]
*  Then people say, wow, what muscles. [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8231.42s)]
*  You can enhance your intellect by studying and doing certain things. [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8233.619999999999s)]
*  People will say, oh, he's so smart, but you can enhance the life within you. [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8238.52s)]
*  Once you enhance the life within you, your presence is significant, both for yourself [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8243.96s)]
*  and for others. [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8249.32s)]
*  So the fourth part of the mind is called chitta. [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8251.2s)]
*  Chitta means that level of intelligence within you. [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8255.32s)]
*  What do you have for breakfast? [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8260.0s)]
*  Eggs or huevos. [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8263.32s)]
*  Is it human? [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8267.52s)]
*  Not a, yeah, animal eggs. [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8268.52s)]
*  Animals? [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8271.02s)]
*  Birds? [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8272.02s)]
*  Yeah, birds. [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8273.02s)]
*  Okay. [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8274.02s)]
*  So you eat a chicken egg and over this three, four hours, this chicken egg become becoming [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8275.02s)]
*  a human being, isn't it? [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8284.02s)]
*  The body that you carry is all what you have eaten. [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8286.26s)]
*  So a bird egg, if a chicken, according to Charles Darwin, has to become a human being, [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8289.58s)]
*  he will say it will take so many million, million years, all right? [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8296.18s)]
*  But you are such a miraculous guy, Theo Wan. [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8300.08s)]
*  Such a miraculous guy, over the morning, over four, five hours' time, he would transform [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8305.64s)]
*  a chicken egg into a human being. [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8313.32s)]
*  Wow. [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8315.880000000001s)]
*  Are you doing it or no? [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8316.880000000001s)]
*  Yeah, technically, yeah. [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8319.4s)]
*  But missing the whole process, missing the profoundness of that experience, isn't it? [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8320.800000000001s)]
*  Because unconscious, whatever you're unconscious of doesn't exist for you. [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8326.82s)]
*  Right now, there's a huge dinosaur standing behind you. [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8333.9s)]
*  Don't look back. [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8337.22s)]
*  But if you are not conscious of it, it doesn't exist, isn't it? [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8339.22s)]
*  True. [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8342.22s)]
*  So I'm saying the greatest force in the universe, which is consciousness, most human beings [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8343.22s)]
*  are not aware of it, so it doesn't exist for them. [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8349.66s)]
*  They struggle with their little bodies and little minds endlessly. [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8352.82s)]
*  If you become conscious of an intelligence which is devoid of memory, this is important, [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8357.46s)]
*  please understand this properly. [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8363.52s)]
*  Your intelligence, presently what you're using is mainly memory-based. [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8365.6s)]
*  If I wipe out your memory, your intellect is useless. [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8370.1s)]
*  It's like you have a computer. [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8375.039999999999s)]
*  If I wipe out all the memory from it, what does your computer do? [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8376.68s)]
*  You can jam your keyboard, nothing happens. [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8382.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8385.12s)]
*  Only with memory it functions. [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8386.12s)]
*  So your present intellect or what you're using right now is only data-based. [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8388.34s)]
*  If you remove the data, it's gone. [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8393.820000000002s)]
*  But there is an intelligence within you which makes a chicken egg into a human being that's [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8397.060000000001s)]
*  not data-driven, it's pure intelligence. [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8402.28s)]
*  You want to call it God, you can call it, you want to call it consciousness, you can [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8405.380000000001s)]
*  You want to call it myself, you can say myself, call it what you want. [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8409.92s)]
*  But one thing is clear. [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8414.1s)]
*  See people are always spreading these things, God is love, God is compassion, God is whatever. [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8416.98s)]
*  If you don't listen to anybody, if you pay attention to life, all you can see is whatever [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8423.140000000001s)]
*  created this is super brilliant. [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8429.800000000001s)]
*  Yes or no? [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8433.44s)]
*  Yes. [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8436.640000000001s)]
*  So when the flower comes, from stink fragrance comes, is this not just brilliance? [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8437.64s)]
*  It's pretty fascinating. [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8444.699999999999s)]
*  If you just do not take any input from anybody, just pay attention to life around you, you [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8446.699999999999s)]
*  will see you should have said God is brilliant instead of sad because people who are desperate [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8453.099999999999s)]
*  desperate for love because nobody around them loves them or they can't love anybody [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8460.46s)]
*  because of that this is God is love, God loves me. [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8467.98s)]
*  No, no. [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8471.099999999999s)]
*  Whatever you're referring to as God is come because mainly you have no explanation for [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8473.3s)]
*  the creation. [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8477.839999999998s)]
*  You don't know how all this happened. [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8480.0s)]
*  So somebody sitting up there and doing it, being human being, we are thinking it's in [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8482.419999999998s)]
*  human form. [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8485.64s)]
*  But essentially you're talking about the source of creation. [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8487.0s)]
*  Source of creation, the only way you can define it if you pay attention to it is incredible [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8490.92s)]
*  intelligence, isn't it? [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8498.32s)]
*  That is the only qualifying value that is there. [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8501.76s)]
*  Rest is all made up according to your needs. [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8504.9s)]
*  If you've fallen down, you think God should be compassion. [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8506.92s)]
*  Nobody responding to you, you think God should be love, so many things. [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8511.2s)]
*  But if you don't do any of those things, simply pay attention to creation, you will see the [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8515.68s)]
*  source of creation is absolute brilliance. [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8520.640000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I would agree with that. [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8524.0s)]
*  Brilliance but not data driven. [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8528.880000000001s)]
*  You must understand evolution is that, that it's not data driven. [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8532.640000000001s)]
*  It's being driven by intelligence. [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8537.320000000002s)]
*  A egg becomes a human being, not data driven. [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8539.88s)]
*  So there is an intelligence within you, which is unsullied by memory. [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8544.039999999999s)]
*  This we call as chitta. [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8548.939999999999s)]
*  There is a… there's a mischievous way in the yogic culture, there's a mischievous way [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8550.56s)]
*  of saying this. [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8555.199999999999s)]
*  They say if you touch your chitta, if you find access to your chitta, God will become [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8556.64s)]
*  your slave. [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8562.599999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah. [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8563.64s)]
*  That means he will do what you want. [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8564.939999999999s)]
*  You don't even have to ask. [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8566.88s)]
*  Interesting. [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8569.08s)]
*  Wow. [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8570.32s)]
*  Yeah, it's a lot of… it's a lot of… it's a lot of conceptualizing, you know. [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8571.439999999999s)]
*  It's pretty fascinating. [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8579.0s)]
*  No, no, no. [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8580.0s)]
*  Concept means you made it up. [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8581.0s)]
*  Oh, it does? [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8582.32s)]
*  The word concept means you made it. [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8584.199999999999s)]
*  Ah. [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8586.48s)]
*  This, I'm not making it. [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8587.48s)]
*  I'm asking you, that's why is it factor fiction what I'm saying. [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8589.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8592.64s)]
*  So, chitta is… [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8593.64s)]
*  We can evolve our chitta or no? [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8599.199999999999s)]
*  We can access. [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8602.359999999999s)]
*  We can access. [[02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8603.359999999999s)]
*  We don't have to evolve it. [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8604.359999999999s)]
*  It is the thing. [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8605.359999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8607.359999999999s)]
*  That's fascinating, man. [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8608.359999999999s)]
*  If you find access, suddenly your life is magical. [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8610.72s)]
*  If you don't find access, it's hard labor. [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8613.519999999999s)]
*  So there's a little bit of homework there. [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8620.24s)]
*  Yeah, before you go, Sai Guru, I wanted to ask you a little bit more about what are the… [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8623.76s)]
*  what is the plans or what are the plans for safe soil? [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8632.039999999999s)]
*  What are the… like what does that look like for you guys as a group moving forward? [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8636.28s)]
*  See, one thing is as a… as a demonstrative project, we have what is called as Kaveri [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8640.119999999999s)]
*  Calling. [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8646.0s)]
*  What Kaveri… [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8647.0s)]
*  What is it called? [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8648.0s)]
*  Kaveri Calling. [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8649.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8651.0s)]
*  Kaveri is the name of a river in southern India. [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8652.0s)]
*  It's a lifeline for three states. [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8654.28s)]
*  Okay. [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8656.52s)]
*  It runs through this… through the three states. [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8657.96s)]
*  As a young person, I grew up around Kaveri River. [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8661.48s)]
*  Okay. [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8665.24s)]
*  What it used to be then, that is fifty plus years ago, what it is today, only forty percent [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8666.24s)]
*  is left. [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8672.52s)]
*  Wow. [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8674.56s)]
*  So why is this? [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8676.68s)]
*  Because we must understand this, how rivers are made. [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8678.8s)]
*  Here the big rivers like let's say Mississippi. [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8682.32s)]
*  Mississippi has been fascination for me because we read a lot of Mark Twain. [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8685.24s)]
*  Mark Twain. [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8691.32s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8692.32s)]
*  I went to his place, Hannibal. [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8693.32s)]
*  Oh you did? [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8694.32s)]
*  Yes. [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8695.32s)]
*  To see his house, his museum. [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8696.32s)]
*  That's cool, man. [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8697.32s)]
*  Yeah, I've been to the top of the Mississippi where you can walk right over it at the very [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8698.32s)]
*  beginning. [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8702.599999999999s)]
*  Pretty cool. [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8703.599999999999s)]
*  Just two days ago I got this book I had missed called Roughing It. [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8705.48s)]
*  Have you seen the book? [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8709.56s)]
*  One of his book called Roughing It. [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8712.28s)]
*  So I just got that, I'm here to open it. [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8714.44s)]
*  Oh nice, congratulations. [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8717.04s)]
*  So Mississippi if you look at it, nearly ninety percent of its water comes from the Great [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8721.44s)]
*  Lakes which is actually ice melting. [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8727.16s)]
*  So in temperate climates most of the rivers largely are melting ice. [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8731.2s)]
*  So that's a different phenomenon altogether. [[02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8736.800000000001s)]
*  But in tropical climates, for example in India there is only one source of water which is [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8738.720000000001s)]
*  the monsoon rains. [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8744.240000000002s)]
*  Monsoon rains have not changed in the last hundred years. [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8746.800000000001s)]
*  Actually now it is increasing. [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8749.84s)]
*  Last year we got hundred and seven percent monsoon. [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8752.880000000001s)]
*  This year, 2024 I think is about hundred and fifteen or hundred and seventeen percent [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8756.0s)]
*  monsoon. [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8761.52s)]
*  It's increasing like that. [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8762.52s)]
*  But what is happening is you either have a flood or a drought, flood and drought, flood [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8764.4s)]
*  and drought. [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8768.12s)]
*  Why this is happening is when the rains come and that torrential rain when it comes, monsoons [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8769.66s)]
*  means you know four days, five days non-stop it will be pouring in the southern India. [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8775.4s)]
*  Yeah, just rain. [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8781.28s)]
*  Just rain. [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8782.88s)]
*  Fantastic time. [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8783.88s)]
*  All this if there was enough vegetation the water would percolate like this because all [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8787.039999999999s)]
*  the root system and the organic content that is there in the soil would make the water [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8792.439999999999s)]
*  go down like this. [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8797.96s)]
*  Okay. [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8798.96s)]
*  When there is no vegetation it runs on the surface like this. [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8799.96s)]
*  So when the rain comes all the rivers flood and in three months it will be in drought [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8803.4s)]
*  now. [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8808.16s)]
*  Wow. [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8809.16s)]
*  Because there is not enough vegetation, agriculture. [[02:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8810.16s)]
*  We've just shared it bald. [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8812.8s)]
*  So in the Cauvery basin which accounts for eighty three thousand square kilometers of [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8814.759999999998s)]
*  land where we are working now, nearly eighty three to eighty four percent of the tree cover [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8819.24s)]
*  has been removed in the last seventy years. [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8825.32s)]
*  We are trying to put this back. [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8829.48s)]
*  Putting it back means there is no space or there is no land for recreating forests because [[02:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8831.92s)]
*  farmers are farming. [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8838.32s)]
*  So we brought in what is called as tree-based agriculture with which you can increase the [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8840.24s)]
*  yield of the crops that you're doing. [[02:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8844.36s)]
*  Tree-based agriculture? [[02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8846.56s)]
*  Yeah, tree-based agriculture. [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8847.56s)]
*  It used to be called agroforestry. [[02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8848.56s)]
*  But because you use the forestry word it goes under the forestry ministry and the forestry [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8851.68s)]
*  ministry has only restrictions, no facilitation. [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8857.88s)]
*  So we called it tree-based agriculture and we are under the agriculture ministry now. [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8862.6s)]
*  A lot better. [[02:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8868.16s)]
*  This is lot better. [[02:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8870.0s)]
*  So now farmers are growing trees which as crops, not fully, in between other crops are [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8871.6s)]
*  still there. [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8878.52s)]
*  Okay. [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8879.52s)]
*  Those crops grow much better because the green litter from the tree, that's the only way [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8880.52s)]
*  organic content comes. [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8883.6s)]
*  Got it. [[02:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8884.96s)]
*  And animals, together the land is richer, better. [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8885.96s)]
*  Over hundred thousand, hundred fifty thousand farmers have significantly changed their economics. [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8889.4s)]
*  Some of them have improved their income anywhere between three hundred to eight hundred percent [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8895.96s)]
*  in a matter of seven to eight years' time. [[02:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8900.08s)]
*  Good for them. [[02:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8902.32s)]
*  So right now we are working in these eighty three thousand square kilometers. [[02:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8903.32s)]
*  As I said earlier, one hundred and fourteen million trees we planted. [[02:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8907.56s)]
*  We are only asking for sixty cents for a tree. [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8912.32s)]
*  Oh, that's great. [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8915.08s)]
*  All your followers, ask them to plant at least one tree on their birthday. [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8916.32s)]
*  That's cool. [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8920.24s)]
*  One point five million trees per year can happen. [[02:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8921.82s)]
*  Okay, that's beautiful. [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8924.04s)]
*  Yeah, to think that that's all it needs. [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8925.04s)]
*  Yeah, we forget about that. [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8927.2s)]
*  So each one of these trees… [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8928.92s)]
*  About giving back to the system. [[02:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8930.24s)]
*  Each one of these trees are geocoded. [[02:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8932.28s)]
*  If any one of them dies, immediately they will be replaced. [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8933.92s)]
*  The Indian Space Research Organization is giving us free service for us to geocode. [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8937.88s)]
*  Wow. [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8943.72s)]
*  And this is all these are being planted in India in that basin? [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8944.72s)]
*  In that basin only. [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8947.88s)]
*  Because the idea is to revive the river to demonstrate that this can be done. [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8949.4s)]
*  Excellent. [[02:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8954.84s)]
*  So we wanted to plant 2.42 billion trees in eight years. [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8955.84s)]
*  But we have done one hundred and fourteen million trees. [[02:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8960.0s)]
*  It's a poor thing, but it's good because… [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8965.12s)]
*  It's still a lot. [[02:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8968.16s)]
*  It's still a lot. [[02:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8969.16s)]
*  So get me to 2.4 billion and in five to six years' time the river will flow much better [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8971.36s)]
*  because the monsoon rains that come, the land has to hold it. [[02:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8978.48s)]
*  See, this is something that people don't know generally is people think water means [[02:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8982.4s)]
*  a pond, a lake, a river, something like this. [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8987.039999999999s)]
*  No. [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8990.52s)]
*  The biggest reservoir of water on the planet is soil. [[02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8991.52s)]
*  Soil. [[02:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8996.28s)]
*  Soil and the vegetation that lives on it, but the soil mainly. [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=8999.28s)]
*  If it's well-vegetated, soil holds the maximum. [[02:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9002.96s)]
*  How much? [[02:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9006.119999999999s)]
*  All the freshwater rivers on the planet, five to eight times more water soil can hold. [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9007.56s)]
*  If soil held that water, temperatures would go down naturally. [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9015.6s)]
*  People are talking about climate change, global warming. [[02:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9021.32s)]
*  You don't have to do PhD in climate affairs. [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9026.24s)]
*  You just go stand in the hot sun for one hour, just go under the tree, climate change will [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9030.56s)]
*  happen. [[02:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9036.0s)]
*  Four to five degrees drop will happen immediately. [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9037.48s)]
*  In tropical countries it will be bigger, all right? [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9039.96s)]
*  So every extra leaf that you put, green leaf that you put on this planet is one more step [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9042.96s)]
*  towards climate mitigation. [[02:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9049.64s)]
*  Every extra leaf, I'm not even saying a tree. [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9052.68s)]
*  So all the people, you are an influencer, you must make sure they put more trees, especially [[02:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9056.36s)]
*  if you put it below thirty-three degrees, I mean, thirty-three degree latitude, it's [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9063.12s)]
*  most effective because that's where the maximum sun is. [[02:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9069.6s)]
*  So one way for us to help fight climate change is to have more trees on our land. [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9074.6s)]
*  More green leaf because the photosynthesis as a phenomena, which is the basis of our [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9079.480000000001s)]
*  life, has come down by eighty percent in the last thousand years. [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9085.92s)]
*  Eighty percent. [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9091.08s)]
*  Yeah, no, I think this is great information and it's good for me to learn too and it's [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9096.08s)]
*  just… [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9099.52s)]
*  See, we are putting solar panels. [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9100.52s)]
*  Well, that's needed for your home, but the best solar panel is a green leaf. [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9101.52s)]
*  It captures solar energy and does fantastic things and makes life out of it. [[02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9107.92s)]
*  Yeah, well, I just think the fact that it's picturing, it's an overall idea of just seeing [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9113.12s)]
*  the world as more than just yourself, of seeing… [[02:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9118.0s)]
*  No, even if it's just for yourself because it's natural for people to think of their [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9120.8s)]
*  well-being. [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9124.359999999999s)]
*  Right. [[02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9125.359999999999s)]
*  See, everybody is busy talking about carbon, carbon, carbon. [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9126.359999999999s)]
*  I'm not saying it's not important. [[02:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9128.679999999998s)]
*  Carbon particles and carbon dioxide is important thing to manage. [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9130.56s)]
*  But what is most important is right now our oxygen levels in the world is coming down [[02:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9134.96s)]
*  slowly. [[02:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9142.4s)]
*  If you push it up by two to three percentage points, mental health, physical health, plant [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9144.18s)]
*  growth, everything will boost itself. [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9150.62s)]
*  Life will happen better. [[02:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9153.78s)]
*  Right now it's some 22.6 percent or something overall atmospheric oxygen. [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9156.5s)]
*  If you push it to thirty percent, we will live a grand life. [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9161.52s)]
*  The only way you can do that is more green leaf. [[02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9165.7s)]
*  Yeah, these are the global O2 levels right here. [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9169.26s)]
*  Look at this. [[02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9172.18s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[02:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9173.18s)]
*  Is that real? [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9174.18s)]
*  Oh, they got a picture. [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9175.18s)]
*  Okay, yes, it's real. [[02:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9176.18s)]
*  What is that? [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9177.18s)]
*  That's unbelievable. [[02:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9178.18s)]
*  Where is it? [[02:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9179.18s)]
*  What is the percentage now? [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9180.18s)]
*  Twenty-one percent something it is. [[02:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9183.18s)]
*  If we push it by five percent or six percent, boom, life will happen so much better. [[02:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9186.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9192.9s)]
*  Well, I'm looking forward to life happening better and I appreciate you, Sadhguru, just [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9193.9s)]
*  what some of you guys' initiatives are with Save Soil and also just helping us have a [[02:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9199.86s)]
*  new idea of ways to experience our experience, you know. [[02:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9204.66s)]
*  And I'll also give you information about Miracle of Mind. [[02:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9212.18s)]
*  Our idea is to make at least three billion people close their eyes for twelve to fifteen [[02:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9215.220000000001s)]
*  minutes a day with some instruction. [[02:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9220.66s)]
*  If three billion people do that, there'll be a significant change in the way the human [[02:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9223.82s)]
*  beings are. [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9228.02s)]
*  Let's make it happen. [[02:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9229.02s)]
*  You got one… [[02:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9230.62s)]
*  Your contribution is 1.5 million. [[02:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9231.62s)]
*  I'm ready. [[02:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9232.98s)]
*  Hey, look, I'm definitely going to start with myself for sure and I'm sure a lot of our [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9233.98s)]
*  listeners will want to get involved. [[02:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9238.34s)]
*  And we'll put the links on that stuff below in the information. [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9239.9s)]
*  And, Sadhguru, thank you so much just for your commitment to, I think, I want to say [[02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9243.58s)]
*  just trying to spread more awareness and peace in the world. [[02:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9249.58s)]

*  Yeah, bliss. [[02:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmsweqqNUo&t=9256.26s)]
