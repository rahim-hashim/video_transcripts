*  It's like in in those like tv shows when you have those crossover episodes. Yeah, that's kind of what it felt like. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=174.89999999999998s)]

*  Is that like part of your world like did your parents like lead you into that like what was just some of your youth? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=265.78s)]

*  Still this huge lab. That's basically the everybody I knew [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=294.42s)]
*  Effectively like their parents worked at the lab or were some affiliate with the lab like nukeville over there on nukeville [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=298.56s)]
*  Yeah, that's that was it scary like that [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=304.58s)]
*  It was you know it at a level of mystery like is your prom like last night under the stars or something like [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=307.06s)]
*  There's a there's this one museum. Well, the funny thing is like first you hear [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=313.7s)]
*  You hear this you learn the story of the atomic bomb and the manhattan project like basically every year growing up [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=317.86s)]
*  Because there's always like a day or a few days where you know [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=324.26s)]
*  There's a substitute teacher and they just they just play the videos. So you're just like an alcoholic or something [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=327.54s)]
*  A recreational user would use that term [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=335.86s)]
*  That's crazy that that just like every year you guys have like [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=339.14s)]
*  Yeah, just like blasted thursdays or whatever and it's just yeah [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=342.98s)]

*  Which is like you walk through and there's like a life-size replica of the nukes [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=352.90000000000003s)]
*  So it's it's pretty wild. Yeah, and where did they drop the atomic bombs on they dropped them on asia, right? Hiroshima? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=358.66s)]
*  They yeah, they dropped them on [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=365.38s)]
*  In in japan. Yeah, hiroshima and nagasaki. Is it is it crazy being like semi-asian part-asian? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=368.74s)]

*  It's nothing. Uh, no, I don't think so. I mean, I think the thing is like, you know, I uh, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=384.1s)]
*  So there weren't I didn't grow up with very many asians because the in that town it was um, you know [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=389.14000000000004s)]

*  so I was one of the only asian kids in my class growing up and so [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=398.42s)]
*  I didn't think that much about it. Honestly, but then [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=403.62s)]
*  Like uh, but it is super weird, you know you grow up and you learn about this [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=406.18s)]
*  very advanced technology that had this like really really big impact on the world and I think that shaped [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=411.78000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it's like the scientific john jones over there really he's new mexican. Isn't he he lives in albuquerque. Yeah, I think he does [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=418.66s)]

*  Energy always there of this creation and so probably the possibility of creation maybe was always in the air [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=429.94s)]
*  I'm just wondering like how did you get formed kind of you know? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=435.22s)]
*  Like what's your origin story kind of it was super scientific because because you know, there were all of these there were all these [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=438.02000000000004s)]
*  Presentations around what were the new kinds of science that were going on at the lab? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=444.72s)]
*  So there's all these chemistry experiments and these different like earth science experiments and uh physics experiments [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=448.90000000000003s)]
*  um, and my mom studied like [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=455.54s)]
*  plasma and like [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=458.16s)]
*  Pla how plasma, you know worked inside of stars and stuff like that [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=459.94000000000005s)]
*  So it was just the wildest stuff and you would talk to people's parent people [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=463.94s)]
*  Like I talked to my classmates or I talked to their parents about what they're working on was always some crazy science thing [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=469.14s)]
*  so [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=474.82s)]
*  That was wow that was really cool because because everybody [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=475.7s)]
*  In that town basically is they're all working on some kind of crazy scientific thing [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=480.26s)]
*  And so you kind of I mean, I feel like I grew up [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=485.78000000000003s)]
*  Feeling like you know anything was possible in that way like yeah [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=488.82s)]
*  Because the rest of us in other communities shitty communities or whatever [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=492.26s)]
*  We're just making that volcano or whatever. You know what I'm saying? We're doing like [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=495.38s)]

*  That's got to be kind of unique. I remember there was someone from our town who did uh, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=511.38s)]
*  Who did a science fair project called? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=515.78s)]
*  It's called like great balls of plasma and for the science literally for the science fair [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=518.5s)]
*  This was in like high school for the science fair. They made [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=522.5799999999999s)]
*  Like huge balls of plasma in their garage [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=525.9399999999999s)]
*  And I was like what the like [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=529.9399999999999s)]
*  This is we're all just doing this [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=532.5s)]
*  In high school. Damn [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=534.98s)]
*  so, do you feel competitive or do you just feel like [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=537.22s)]
*  Hyper capable like did you feel like kind of advanced just in your studies? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=540.5799999999999s)]
*  Like when you were young like did you in class you like or some of this stuff's kind of coming easy to me [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=543.62s)]
*  I ended up what what I did is um, there was uh, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=548.18s)]
*  I ended up getting really competitive about math in particular. Yeah, and [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=552.02s)]
*  So, uh, so my sport was math, which is kind of crazy that algebra isi son [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=558.18s)]
*  I know I feel you [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=563.3s)]
*  Um, and it was because when I was in middle school when I was in sixth grade [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=564.58s)]
*  There was this one math competition where if you if you got top four in the state [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=568.34s)]
*  State of new mexico, then you would get an all-expense paid trip to disney world [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=574.2600000000001s)]
*  And uh, and I remember as a sixth grader [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=579.0600000000001s)]
*  Like that was the most motivating thing I could possibly imagine was like an all-expense paid trip to disney world. Yeah [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=582.2600000000001s)]
*  And then uh, did you win it? I got I won it. I got fourth place. So I snuck in there fire [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=589.86s)]
*  uh snuck in [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=595.3000000000001s)]
*  I uh, and then I went to and then we went to florida to disney world and I uh, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=596.66s)]
*  I hadn't traveled like I didn't travel around too much growing up [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=601.4599999999999s)]
*  Like I mostly was in new mexico and we did some road trips around the southwest [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=604.5799999999999s)]
*  So I remember getting to florida and it was extremely humid [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=607.78s)]
*  It was like I never felt what humidity felt like when I landed in florida. I was like, oh this feels bad [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=611.9399999999999s)]
*  and then I [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=618.1s)]
*  Yeah, it definitely does [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=620.9s)]
*  Yeah, it's funny because I grew up inhumid dude [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=623.22s)]
*  Like you would like you try to shake somebody's hand you couldn't even land it because it was just not enough [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=626.02s)]
*  Viscous just too much lube in a handshake. You'd sit there for 10 minutes trying to land a handshake, you know [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=630.8199999999999s)]
*  Everybody was always dripping, you know all the time people you always thought they were scared or something [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=636.8199999999999s)]
*  They were kind of geeked up off a gas station dope or something, but people were just it was humid [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=640.8199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you get really humid over there. So then I became so then I became a mathlete [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=645.6999999999999s)]
*  That was like a big part of my identity was being a mathlete and I would and you have to wear a vest [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=650.18s)]
*  What do you guys do? Is there an out? Is there a uniform for that or? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=654.42s)]
*  Well, you you need a [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=657.78s)]
*  You have a calculator. Okay, everyone had their favorite calculator. Okay, you got that draco on you, baby [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=659.78s)]
*  I feel you keep strapped [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=665.06s)]
*  You stay strapped at that thing [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=667.14s)]
*  and then uh [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=669.6999999999999s)]
*  But uh, but outside of that not really I mean like everyone had their favorite like his pencil, you know [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=670.9s)]
*  You're your pencil your calculator. That was your gear and uh, but yeah [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=674.3399999999999s)]
*  No, I I was I was like a a nationally ranked mathlete for uh for middle school high school [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=677.94s)]
*  That was my that was my jam. Yeah, and is it what's that math circle? Like is there? [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=685.3000000000001s)]
*  Wow, that's crazy, dude [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=690.74s)]
*  So you go to what other competitions you go to with those competitions? Yeah, there's like there's like state level competitions [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=693.3000000000001s)]
*  There's national level competitions. There's like these summer camps math camp. I went to math camp a bunch of times [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=699.5400000000001s)]
*  Um where you where you convene with like-minded mathletes [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=706.5s)]
*  Okay [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=710.1800000000001s)]
*  Wow fucking wizards in the park [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=711.3000000000001s)]
*  A couple dudes fucking fighting over a common denominator in the lobby. That's crazy, bro [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=713.86s)]
*  But then you're but just like any other sport like you're like it's competitive [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=719.46s)]
*  You know, you gotta like you gotta win and uh, and so so you're chummy with everyone [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=723.46s)]

*  No, dude competition's amazing man, that's one thing is too that's so nice [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=732.26s)]
*  I think about when you're young is like if you're involved in a sport or a group or whatever it was [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=735.46s)]
*  Um, just just that chance to be competitive, you know [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=740.34s)]
*  Yeah, what are what were like some of the competitions at the math thing? [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=743.38s)]
*  Like what's a what's a math competition like when you get there? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=745.94s)]
*  So you uh, the ones in the middle school middle school were actually more fun because there's like there's almost like a jeopardy style [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=748.9s)]
*  buzzer competition and stuff like that [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=755.46s)]
*  But uh, but in high school once you get to high school [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=757.94s)]
*  It's just uh, you just take a test and you just it's like the the biggest one in america is called the usamo [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=760.4200000000001s)]
*  Bring it up [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=768.5s)]
*  usamo usamo [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=770.02s)]
*  Okay, and uh, and it's like [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=772.4200000000001s)]
*  People all around the country take this test [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=776.4200000000001s)]
*  Uh, and there's uh, and the united states of american mathematical olympiad. Okay, there you go [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=778.98s)]
*  Um, okay a participant must be either us citizen or a legal resident of us [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=784.34s)]
*  Um, okay. Okay, go on and then you uh, and then it's a nine hour test [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=788.26s)]
*  It's split over two days. It's nine hours [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=794.1800000000001s)]
*  You it's four and a half hours and it's nine hours and you have six problems [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=797.1400000000001s)]
*  So it's kind of nerve-wracking and you get in there you have four and a half hours the first day four and a half hours [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=801.94s)]
*  the second day [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=806.5s)]
*  Um, can you cheat in between the days? [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=807.46s)]
*  Can you just go home and no you because you only get three questions the first day and then you only get three questions [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=809.22s)]
*  the next day and [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=814.02s)]
*  I remember the first time I took it [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=816.58s)]
*  I was in I think I was uh, I was in eighth grade first time I took it and I like [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=819.14s)]
*  I was like so nervous and I just I like brought a thermos full of coffee and I drank so much coffee that like [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=824.5s)]
*  Those four and a half hours felt like like a year. It was like I was so jittery the whole time. It was uh, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=831.38s)]
*  It was crazy. Dang you out there rattling brother. Oh integers make me rattle brother. I feel you on that [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=837.0600000000001s)]
*  Dude, so that's pretty so so so you're competitive and so you get out of there and you're obviously I guess um [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=843.7s)]
*  Admired in the world of math probably or that's that's like a thing that like uh, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=849.94s)]
*  That you can point that that's like a pin [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=853.94s)]
*  That you feathering your cat so that that helps you get into um, MIT, right? Yep. Okay [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=856.6600000000001s)]
*  So then uh, yeah in MIT on the MIT admissions they ask for your like competitive math scores [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=862.74s)]
*  So if you're so so you knew a lot of kids going there probably because it was tons of kids. Yeah [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=870.18s)]
*  Yeah, tons of kids. It was like a reunion [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=874.3399999999999s)]
*  It was like math camp reunion damn because I was wondering where all y'all were at dude because we were doing some other shit [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=876.02s)]
*  You know what i'm saying? Yeah, we were not [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=881.62s)]
*  God, that's where all the smart kids were that's fascinating man. And so then uh, yeah [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=884.26s)]
*  I was at MIT and then uh MIT is like a really intense school because they [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=889.38s)]
*  You know the classes they don't fuck around with they just really like they load you up with tons of work [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=896.74s)]
*  And most of the time you have you you like they load you up with like huge amounts of work [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=901.3s)]
*  and they you know, you you uh, you don't really know what's going on initially and so you're just kind of like [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=905.78s)]
*  Just trying to make it through but uh, you know, there's this motto that uh that MIT has called [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=910.5s)]
*  uh, ihtfp [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=916.32s)]
*  Which uh among the students stands for I hate this fucking place. Oh, yeah [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=918.4000000000001s)]
*  It's heavy, huh? Yeah, but then but then the school when you go they tell you oh it stands for um, i've truly found paradise [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=922.96s)]
*  so oh [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=929.12s)]
*  So a couple differences of opinion. Yeah. Yeah damn [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=930.72s)]
*  So it's so it's really severe there. There's a lot of work. They load you down out of the gate [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=934.4000000000001s)]
*  You do you do a lot of work? Uh, but it's it's kind of awesome [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=938.96s)]
*  I mean because because I think the students really band together like you like instead of [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=942.24s)]
*  Like I think uh, instead of it being competitive really MIT is much more about like everybody kind of like coming together [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=946.64s)]
*  Working on problems together working homework together and just kind of like making it through together [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=953.6800000000001s)]
*  Um, what's that social life like there? Like are you dating you going to parties? What's that like for you at that time? [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=958.72s)]
*  It's a bunch of parties because people like MIT there's a lot of people who like tinkering with gadgets [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=964.0s)]
*  So like tinkering with like, you know [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=969.5200000000001s)]
*  Lights and big speakers and dj sets and all this stuff [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=972.0799999999999s)]
*  So actually the parties are pretty good because they're like the production value is high the production quality is high [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=975.04s)]
*  And then what about when the science kids come through the lab dogs [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=983.04s)]
*  Are they bringing are people making like unique drugs? [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=986.24s)]
*  Was there like designer drugs that are being created by actual people like just [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=988.16s)]
*  because you know i'm saying [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=992.4s)]
*  Like my friends in college, none of us would know how to do that [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=994.88s)]
*  But there may be somebody at a smart at a more prestigious school that would know how was that a thing even or is that just [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=997.44s)]
*  There's one there was one part of the campus called east campus [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1003.7600000000001s)]
*  Um where it was like it was more fringe and so there was like at one point in the school year [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1007.6800000000001s)]
*  They would in their courtyard. They would build a gigantic catapult [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1012.8000000000001s)]
*  Like a huge catapult like a trebuchet like a trebuchet. Yeah [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1017.0400000000001s)]

*  Um, what is ai? [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1595.52s)]
*  Yeah, so so ai is all about you know, basically programming computers to be able to start [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1597.6s)]
*  Thinking like humans so, you know traditional computer programming [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1604.88s)]
*  Uh, you know, it's pretty it's pretty bare bones. It's not very smart [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1609.7s)]
*  And so ai is all about can you have can you build algorithms that start to be able to think like people and and [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1613.7800000000002s)]
*  replicate some of the [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1621.3600000000001s)]
*  Like our brains are these incredible incredible things, you know, and that's that's evolution [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1623.22s)]
*  That's just biology that created our brains [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1628.9s)]
*  And so it's all about how can we how can we build something similar to that or replicate it? [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1631.8600000000001s)]
*  Using using computers and machines and so the whole you know, the the the whole modern ai [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1636.9s)]
*  Era really started around [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1644.5800000000002s)]
*  An area called computer vision, but it was like how can we first get? [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1648.1000000000001s)]
*  computers to [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1652.66s)]
*  See like like humans do so one of the very first so, you know, one of the very first ai [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1654.18s)]
*  Projects was this thing called image net [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1661.68s)]
*  Image net and later alex net and it was basically can you get [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1664.64s)]
*  Computer programs like given a photo to tell you what's in that photo [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1669.68s)]
*  I see so just like a human would like if you showed them this yeah, you're starting to train them to [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1673.44s)]
*  um [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1678.3200000000002s)]
*  have a perspective [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1679.28s)]
*  Yeah train them to well actually originally like [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1681.2s)]
*  You could like let's say you took a photo of this of this bottle a machine wouldn't even be able to tell you [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1684.24s)]
*  What's in the photo? [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1688.72s)]
*  It would just know what the pixels were but it wouldn't be able to tell you like oh, there's a bottle in that in that photo [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1689.84s)]
*  So the you know, one of the first ai breakthroughs was when youtube [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1695.76s)]
*  built an algorithm that could tell [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1700.56s)]
*  When there were cats in their videos and that was like this, you know in like 2012 or 2011 [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1702.6399999999999s)]
*  This was like this mind-blowing breakthrough that you could like figure out you could like [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1709.04s)]
*  Use an algorithm to figure out when there was a cat inside a inside a video [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1713.4399999999998s)]
*  and so [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1717.52s)]
*  Ai it started pretty simply with just how do we replicate? You know? [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1718.88s)]
*  Vision like how do you replicate like our basically the fact that our eyes and our brains can like process all this imagery coming in [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1724.72s)]
*  And that really led to I think one of the first major [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1732.16s)]
*  Use cases of ai which is self-driving cars [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1735.3600000000001s)]
*  so this was [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1738.8000000000002s)]
*  when we when I started the company in 2016 self-driving cars were all the rage because [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1740.3200000000002s)]
*  You know, it was you know, there were all these like skunkworks projects when you started scale ai, you mean [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1746.4s)]
*  Yeah, when I started scaling so when you kind of got into ai, yep at that time self-driving cars are the most popular things [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1750.8s)]
*  Yeah, yep. That was all the rage and so it was it was all about can you know? [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1757.2s)]
*  Can we start building algorithms that can drive a car like a human would and do it safely and do it? [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1762.3200000000002s)]
*  You know more efficiently and that way instead of that was that was one of the first major areas. Okay, and then [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1767.8400000000001s)]
*  Now, you know [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1775.44s)]
*  The whole the whole industry has moved so fast [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1776.64s)]
*  But then all of a sudden we got chat gbt and we got you know [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1779.04s)]
*  More advanced stuff more recently that that is able to talk like a human or sort of think like a human [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1782.88s)]
*  And so it's really come up pretty far recently, but all of it is about how do you [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1787.92s)]
*  You build algorithms how to use machines to be able to think like a person. Okay? [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1793.2s)]
*  And is it a pro? [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1798.08s)]
*  It's like say if I opened a door like like oh we keep the ai in there. Is it a computer? [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1799.28s)]
*  Is it a program? [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1804.56s)]
*  Is it a hard drive like what? [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1806.24s)]
*  Okay [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1809.12s)]
*  What is that? Yeah. Yeah, so there's two parts. There's two parts to it [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1810.16s)]
*  So the first part is you need really advanced chips. So you need like, uh [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1813.84s)]
*  Uh, like these they're called gpus or sometimes called tpus or you know [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1821.28s)]
*  There's a lot of different words for it, but you need like the most advanced computer chips in the world [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1825.12s)]
*  Okay, and they how big is each one? Do you know? [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1829.6799999999998s)]
*  Uh, like or can you measure it like that? [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1832.08s)]
*  They I mean the biggest ones are actually like the whole chips are like, you know [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1834.6399999999999s)]
*  but they they're like a they're like a like a wafer kind of thing, but then you um, [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1839.76s)]
*  You put a lot of them all together. Okay, so these uh [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1844.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, exactly [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1848.6399999999999s)]
*  Um, these like uh, these chips and the the biggest ones are are [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1850.64s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. That's a little one. That's a little one. There's really big ones. Okay [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1855.2s)]
*  but these are the so this is the [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1860.24s)]
*  These are the brain cells of it. Yep. These are these are the brains behind it. Yeah, so then um, yeah, exactly [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1862.72s)]
*  These are some those are some big ones. So then so you have to have a lot of these chips [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1868.72s)]
*  So you need a ton of these chips and that's that's kind of the the like, uh, that's the physical presence [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1872.24s)]
*  And then um, and then by the way, they take a huge amount of energy [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1878.8000000000002s)]
*  They're really uh, they because they have you have to do a lot of you know [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1882.48s)]
*  calculations and there's a lot of math that has to happen on them and so [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1886.22s)]
*  um, and you have you have giant basically [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1889.76s)]
*  Datacenters buildings full of like tons and tons of those chips just in giant rows [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1893.2800000000002s)]
*  Like how big are we talking warehouses? Yeah, the biggest one. I mean like um, like elon's datacenter colossus is like [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1897.68s)]
*  uh [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1905.2800000000002s)]
*  I mean, it's probably more than a million. It's definitely more than a million square feet. I mean, it's like just huge really [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1906.32s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, look up colossus [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1911.2s)]
*  Uh, i've never known this. Yeah, uh [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1913.2s)]
*  Yeah, yeah that that uh, you see that building with the sunset second row. Yeah. Yeah, there you go [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1916.96s)]
*  Or uh the one to the left. Oh, no. Yeah, that one. Yeah. Look it's like a huge ass building [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1922.24s)]
*  It's huge and all that's just filled with chips [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1928.96s)]
*  um [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1931.68s)]
*  Have you ever been in there? [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1932.8s)]
*  I haven't been in that one, but i've been in some of these and it's just and this is what it looks like inside [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1934.24s)]
*  Yeah, basically. Yeah, so it's just rows and rows of chips. So no plants or anything [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1938.32s)]
*  Yeah, no plants. No plants. It gets hot in there. I so [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1943.36s)]
*  Um, so the first part is just the the that's the physical presence and then the second part are the algorithms [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1947.9199999999998s)]
*  So then you have like on top of those chips you have you have software that that's running [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1955.12s)]
*  And the the algorithms are just all are like what you actually are telling [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1961.3600000000001s)]
*  What's the math that you're telling to happen on the chips and those algorithms are, you know, some of the you know [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1965.44s)]
*  most complicated algorithms that [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1971.44s)]
*  Humans have ever come up with and that's kind of the that's kind of the software part or that's kind of the that's the part that like [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1973.44s)]
*  You know exists on the internet or you can download or whatnot and then it has to be run on these like huge [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1980.72s)]
*  Warehouses of giant of giant ships. Okay [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1985.74s)]
*  Um, so when someone goes to [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1988.6399999999999s)]
*  Like scale ai or chat gpt. These are all ai interfaces or what are they they're yeah, so so [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1991.36s)]
*  Yeah, like chat gpt is a is a way to be able to [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=1999.28s)]
*  Talk to basically you can talk to the algorithm. Okay, so you can start interacting directly with the algorithm [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2003.4399999999998s)]
*  You can see how the algorithm is thinking [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2008.72s)]
*  So you could say to this? Um [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2011.76s)]
*  Can you describe the weather today exactly? Yeah, and if you said that to [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2013.76s)]
*  Five different ai company or ai companies basically or ai algorithms different different ai systems [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2018.32s)]
*  Yeah, so if you said that's five different ai systems, you might get a little bit of a varied answer a little bit [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2025.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah, okay [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2029.6s)]
*  You'll get because they all are trying to have their own style and have their own vibe to it interesting [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2030.3999999999999s)]
*  And then what we do what what scale ai is all about is we've kind of built the uh, [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2035.6s)]
*  Almost like the uber of ai. Okay, so a lot of what we're trying to do is how do we [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2040.96s)]
*  So how do we help produce data that is improving these algorithms and just like how uber there's okay [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2046.32s)]
*  You're losing me there a little yeah. Yeah, it's okay [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2052.64s)]
*  But if I slow down that if I if you're losing me, uh, but so explain that to me a little bit clearer for me [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2055.2s)]
*  Yeah, so so okay. So with these algorithms, um, [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2060.7999999999997s)]
*  One key ingredient for these algorithms is data [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2065.04s)]
*  So okay, so you have the chips and everything that are that are storing all the information. Yep [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2068.56s)]
*  They're storing the data. Yep, and then you have the algorithms that are helping mediate between the user and the data [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2073.12s)]
*  Yeah, so basically you kind of have yeah, you have three you have three key pieces [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2079.44s)]
*  Okay, so you have the uh, you have the computation bars for the chips [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2083.7599999999998s)]
*  You have the chips you have the data [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2088.08s)]
*  Which is like just tons and tons of data that that's where the algorithms are learning the patterns from [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2090.4s)]
*  So these algorithms they aren't just like they don't just learn to talk randomly [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2097.12s)]
*  They learn it from learning to talk from how humans talk, right? [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2100.88s)]
*  So you need tons and tons of data and then you have the algorithms which uh, [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2104.32s)]
*  Learn from all that data and then they run on top of the chips. Got it. Um, so then [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2109.44s)]
*  one of the big [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2115.84s)]
*  challenges in the industry is okay, how are you going to produce all this data and so, um, [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2117.28s)]
*  Uh, this is how are you going to get data for your? [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2123.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah system like how do you farm the best data? [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2126.2400000000002s)]
*  How do exactly how do you build how do you build all that data and how do you do that? [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2128.72s)]
*  Um in the most effective way, how do you build new data? [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2132.72s)]
*  So clean data because what if you get a bunch of data in there? [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2136.0s)]
*  That's just a bunch of advertisements and bullshit. Will that affect the output 100? Yeah, that definitely affects the output [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2138.2400000000002s)]
*  So this whole data so data is is, you know [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2144.64s)]
*  some people say like data is the new oil or data is new gold like data is really really [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2147.36s)]
*  valuable because it's [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2152.78s)]
*  It's how the algorithms are learning everything that are learning like any [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2154.4s)]
*  Anything that the algorithms know or learn or say or do all that has to come from the data that goes into it [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2158.8s)]
*  Okay [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2165.44s)]
*  So so if I ask the if I ask a system an ai system a question [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2165.76s)]
*  Or ask it to help me with something help me to design something or to curate an idea [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2169.84s)]
*  It's going to use the data that it has within it. Yep to [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2175.44s)]
*  Respond to me and help me and help give me an answer that I can use [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2179.68s)]
*  And it's only and the data it has in it is only based upon the data that [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2183.92s)]
*  Um is put into it. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2189.2s)]
*  So then so yeah, it's kind of um, so then we don't you know, we don't spend enough time talking about [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2192.96s)]
*  Where does you know, how are you going to get this data? And how are you going to keep making new data? [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2199.2799999999997s)]
*  so [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2203.36s)]
*  the the angle that we took at scale was to kind of um [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2204.24s)]
*  Turn this into an opportunity for people. So um, we're you know, we're kind of like the uber for ai [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2208.2400000000002s)]
*  So just like how uber you have, you know riders and drivers for us. We have [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2214.48s)]
*  You know, we have the ai [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2220.7200000000003s)]
*  Systems, you know the algorithms that need data and then we have [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2223.44s)]
*  A community of people a network of people who help produce the data that go into the systems and they get paid to do that [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2227.6800000000003s)]
*  Also, they're almost data farming like creating good data or creating good data exactly [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2234.32s)]
*  So and it's and it's huge. It's like uh, so we do this through [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2239.6800000000003s)]
*  Our platform called outlier. Okay, and uh [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2244.56s)]
*  outlier last year [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2248.1600000000003s)]
*  Uh people contributors we call them contributors on outlier earned about 500 million dollars total across everybody [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2250.1600000000003s)]
*  Um in the u.s. That's across [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2258.2400000000002s)]
*  9,000 different towns. Um, and uh [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2261.1000000000004s)]
*  So it created a lot of jobs a lot of jobs. Okay, and so what would um, okay [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2263.84s)]
*  So scale was your company scale ai system. Yep. Is that right? So we uh [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2268.08s)]
*  Yeah, I mean the yeah scale ai is an ai system. Okay, and then outlier [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2274.4s)]
*  Yep is a separate company that works with it. Yep [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2278.6400000000003s)]
*  and that is where you are [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2282.56s)]
*  Um hiring people we yeah, we we basically to pull in data [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2286.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, we we build this platform that [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2291.7599999999998s)]
*  anybody [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2295.12s)]
*  you know a lot of people all frankly all around the world, but americans too can log on and [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2296.3199999999997s)]
*  Uh and help build data that goes into the algorithms and get paid to do so [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2301.4399999999996s)]
*  Yeah, so how and and how does a user do that? Like what is an example of somebody who's helping build data for an ai database? [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2308.16s)]
*  Yeah, let's say you're a nurse like you're a nurse with like tons of tons of experience [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2314.7999999999997s)]
*  So, you know a lot about how to take care of people [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2318.8s)]
*  and uh take care of people who are sick or you know have issues and whatnot and uh, [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2322.6400000000003s)]
*  so you you could log on to the system and and this and our platform and you could see that the algorithm [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2327.04s)]
*  Is you know, let's say you ask the algorithm like hey, I have a you know, I have a pain in my in my stomach [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2334.48s)]
*  What should I do? [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2340.32s)]
*  And you notice that the algorithm says the wrong thing like the algorithm says oh just you know hang out and and you know [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2341.36s)]
*  It'll go it'll go away. Yeah, and you know as a nurse like that's wrong [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2346.72s)]
*  like I you know [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2350.8799999999997s)]
*  You have to you have to go to the emergency room because you might have appendicitis or you might have you know [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2352.0s)]
*  You might have something really bad. And so you would as a nurse you would go in and you'd basically [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2356.4s)]
*  Correct all these mistakes that the ai system has and then that would then feed it back into the algorithm [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2360.8799999999997s)]
*  So that's smarter the next time so it's kind of this this continual process of and there's versions that for [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2367.04s)]
*  Whatever your expertise is or whatever, you know, you know more about than anything everything everything exactly [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2373.52s)]
*  So and so people get paid for that. Yeah. Yeah, they get paid and how do you know if their information is valuable or not? [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2380.0s)]
*  uh, well [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2386.7200000000003s)]
*  We so we don't want spam obviously [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2388.2400000000002s)]
*  So we we we have a lot of systems to make sure that people aren't spamming and that like you're saying it's not it's not [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2390.0800000000004s)]
*  You know, it's not garbage in that's going into the into the algorithms [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2395.76s)]
*  So we have you know [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2399.84s)]
*  We have kind of like people check the work of other people to make sure that the ai systems are really good [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2401.1200000000003s)]
*  And we have some like automated systems that check this stuff [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2406.0s)]
*  But uh, but for the most part it's it's like it's really broad like we want [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2409.04s)]
*  experts in [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2413.44s)]
*  Anything everything shellfish train tracks, whatever. Yeah gelatin [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2414.8s)]
*  Everything childhood death or whatever. Yeah, totally stars galaxies, whatever animals big animals [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2419.92s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, i am [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2427.44s)]
*  so [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2428.88s)]
*  Wow [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2429.68s)]
*  so it's kind of like your data is almost like an ocean or a body of water and you [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2430.56s)]
*  Different places are going to be able to keep their body of water cleaner or dirtier and different infections could get in different spyware [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2435.12s)]
*  All types of stuff. So and if you have the really a clean body of water, then you're going to be able to offer a clean [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2441.7599999999998s)]
*  data or a certain type of data [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2448.32s)]
*  to [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2450.88s)]
*  um [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2451.92s)]
*  People who are using your ai platform does that make sense or not? [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2452.72s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, totally and our job is like how do we make sure that this body of water is as clean as possible? [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2456.3999999999996s)]
*  And we fill it up as much as possible that it has as much information about everything across the globe [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2462.24s)]
*  Wow, so is there almost a a race for information right now in a weird way or no? [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2468.0s)]
*  Is that not it? They're a little bit. Yeah, I think that there's a well [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2472.08s)]
*  There's a race for like how are different ai systems competing against each other and sorry to interrupt you [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2475.6s)]
*  Yeah, no, no, so the there's a there's it's it goes back to the three things I mentioned so there's kind of like three [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2480.6400000000003s)]
*  Dimensions that that they're all competing as one other one is [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2486.78s)]
*  Chips, so who could who is the most advanced chips? [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2491.28s)]
*  Who is the the biggest buildings of chips like who is the most chips that they're utilizing? [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2494.0800000000004s)]
*  Data so the kind of body of water whose body of water is better cleaner, you know [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2500.0s)]
*  Healthiest biggest etc. And then the last is algorithm. So who's and this is where the scientists really come in [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2504.96s)]
*  It's like, okay [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2511.6800000000003s)]
*  Who's coming up with the cleverest algorithms or who has like a trick on an algorithm that somebody else doesn't have? [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2512.6400000000003s)]
*  Like who's doing that to basically? [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2519.28s)]
*  Make the ai learn better off of the data that it has [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2521.76s)]
*  Wow [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2525.44s)]
*  God i'm in the future right now [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2526.88s)]
*  That's so why [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2529.44s)]
*  Man, it's just it's so crazy [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2531.2799999999997s)]
*  And I think ai scares people because the future scares people right? It's like that's one of the scariest things [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2533.4399999999996s)]
*  Sometimes is the future. So I think a lot of times people you associate [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2538.3999999999996s)]
*  Um, because a lot of times people mention ai there's a little bit of fear. It seems like from people [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2542.48s)]
*  Yeah, um, there's fear that it's going to take jobs. There's fear that it's going to take over [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2546.48s)]
*  Um our ability to think for ourselves. Yeah, there's just kind of some general uncertainty there like is just [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2550.64s)]
*  And it kind of feels like fear a lot of times [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2557.52s)]
*  But a lot of times fear is just a lack of knowledge, right? [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2559.36s)]
*  Um [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2563.1200000000003s)]
*  And not a lack of knowledge because you didn't want to know just because you don't know [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2564.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, or that you're dumb, but just because you don't know. Um [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2567.44s)]
*  What are what are positive things that we're going to see with ai, right? I want to start there [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2571.92s)]
*  Yeah, so I think first like we don't the ai [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2575.76s)]
*  Industry, we don't do the best job explaining this and I think sometimes we make it seem all sci-fi and [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2579.52s)]
*  And and genuinely we we're part of the problem and making it seem scary, right? [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2586.08s)]
*  But you know one thing for example is like I think ai is actually going to create a ton of jobs [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2590.96s)]
*  and [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2598.0s)]
*  That story is not told enough [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2598.96s)]
*  But you know these jobs that we're producing or this this sort of this opportunity that we're providing on our platform outlier [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2600.3199999999997s)]
*  Like that's only going to grow as ai grows [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2606.96s)]
*  So because you have to have new data you have to have new data [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2609.52s)]
*  And the only place you can get new data is from people will at a certain point would the system be able to create [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2612.48s)]
*  It can probably matriculate data or matriculate. Is that with birthing or what is that? [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2618.96s)]
*  Yeah, it just moves through like okay. It can probably like [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2623.28s)]
*  Quantify or and and give you answers, but it can ai create new data [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2627.58s)]
*  uh [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2632.96s)]
*  No, so I think well it can do a little bit of that so it can ai can help itself create its own data [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2633.92s)]
*  Um and and help itself a little bit, but ultimately [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2640.88s)]
*  Most of the progress is going to come from you know people who are able to help [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2644.24s)]
*  Really the model get better and smarter and more capable at all these all these different areas [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2649.44s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't see that part of it. I didn't understand that we are the ones who are giving it [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2654.64s)]
*  Information and since we're going to continue to learn I would assume that we would be able to help to continue to [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2661.1s)]
*  Help it learn. Yeah, and the world's going to keep changing and we're going to need to be able to keep teaching [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2666.8s)]
*  The the algorithms keep teaching the models about how the world's changing. So in it, you know [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2672.0800000000004s)]
*  This is actually a a big thing that I think most people don't understand the people who are getting the opportunity now [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2677.84s)]
*  We're earning money from it see it but as ai grows [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2684.0800000000004s)]
*  There's actually going to be tons of jobs created along the way and tons of opportunity for people to help [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2688.0s)]
*  Improve ai systems or control ai systems or overall? [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2694.96s)]
*  Sort of be a part of the the technology not just sort of disenfranchised by it [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2699.6s)]
*  Okay [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2704.64s)]
*  So like yeah, so what are you do you feel like are other ways like if you had to look into the future a little bit [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2705.12s)]
*  Right, so you have the fact that people are going to be able to add more data [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2710.24s)]
*  Right and add nuances to data. Yep, right and um and probably humanized data a little bit. Yeah, totally. Um [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2713.7599999999998s)]
*  And then you're also going to have [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2721.52s)]
*  What? [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2723.92s)]
*  I think you're going to have a lot of [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2724.88s)]
*  a lot of jobs around you know as ai starts [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2727.68s)]
*  Doing all these little things throughout the world who's gonna [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2732.56s)]
*  Keep watch of those ai and who's going to make sure that those ai are [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2736.48s)]
*  Aren't doing something that we don't want them to do [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2740.72s)]
*  So almost like managing the ai's and and keeping watch over all the ai systems [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2742.8s)]
*  That's going to be another thing that we're going to have to do [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2747.92s)]
*  Um, and then and then it's just somebody to kind of guide the river a little bit [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2750.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah at certain point guide the stream stay in there. Uh watch make sure that answers are correct. Make sure the information [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2754.88s)]
*  Um is honest. Yeah. Yeah, like like I think for example, um, you know [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2762.4s)]
*  We're not gonna just have ai's going around and you know [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2769.04s)]
*  You know buying stuff and doing crazy things and like you know [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2775.04s)]
*  We're gonna we're gonna keep it controlled right like as a society [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2778.48s)]
*  I think we're gonna keep it controlled as a technology [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2781.76s)]
*  And I think there's gonna be a lot of jobs for people to make sure that the ai doesn't go out and do [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2784.48s)]
*  Crazy things that we don't want it to do right. So we want to be so you're gonna need managers. You're gonna need facilitators [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2790.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, exactly [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2794.72s)]
*  What are things that ai will alleviate like what are things that like will it eventually be able to have enough information? [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2795.84s)]
*  like our data [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2803.2s)]
*  where [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2805.04s)]
*  Where it can like cure diseases and stuff like that like is that a realistic thing? Yeah, that's super real. Um [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2806.16s)]
*  Like cancer even yeah cancer [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2812.3199999999997s)]
*  Um, yeah heart disease like all these all these diseases. Yeah cancer on its heels [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2814.7999999999997s)]
*  But but sorry antonio brown was just here. I think there's still some smoke in the air. So [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2821.2s)]
*  Um, no, but seriously, I think that ai [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2826.56s)]
*  Uh one thing that we've seen which is this is kind of wild but ai [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2829.7599999999998s)]
*  understands like molecules and biology better than humans do actually because [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2834.46s)]
*  it's uh, like like there there's this there's this thing in ai where you know, it used to take a [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2842.32s)]
*  Like a phd biologist like, you know five years to do something that the ai can can just do in [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2849.36s)]
*  you know a few minutes, right and that's because the [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2856.96s)]
*  Like uh, just the way that molecules and biology and all that works is something that that ai happens to be really good at [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2861.44s)]
*  And that's going to help us ultimately cure diseases find [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2867.92s)]
*  You know [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2872.56s)]
*  Pharmaceuticals or other treatments for these diseases and ultimately help humans live longer because that's very data driven, right? [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2873.66s)]
*  Like it's very specific. It's very mathematic exactly. Yeah. Yeah [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2879.92s)]
*  um, so it's going to be a huge tool for us to to cure disease, um for us to help educate [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2884.48s)]
*  people um for us to you know, there's a lot of a lot of really exciting uses for ai [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2890.48s)]
*  but I think the kind of I think the thing that um [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2895.92s)]
*  will touch most people in their lives is it's really going to be a [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2899.44s)]
*  like a tool that will help you um, you know make all of your sort of uh [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2904.48s)]
*  Make all your dreams kind of become reality if that makes sense. So so I think one of the things that ai [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2910.8s)]
*  Is going to be really awesome for is like, you know today if I I have like a million ideas, right? [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2916.88s)]
*  I have like, you know thousands and thousands of ideas and I only have so much time so I can only really do [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2922.8s)]
*  You know a few of them at a time and most of the ideas just go to die, right? Yeah, they do, huh? [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2928.16s)]
*  Yeah, that's a bummer. It's a huge bummer [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2934.16s)]
*  Yeah, and I think a lot of people, you know for whatever reason they may have some of the best ideas ever [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2936.2400000000002s)]
*  But they just you know, they're too busy or they have like other shit going on in their lives [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2941.6s)]
*  They can't make those ideas happen [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2945.6s)]
*  and it's great what sometimes when people are able to make the leaps and make them happen and like devote themselves to their dreams, but [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2947.84s)]
*  um, but that doesn't happen enough today and one of the things that ai is going to help us do I [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2953.52s)]
*  Legitimately think so is it's going to help us. Um [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2958.78s)]
*  Turn these ideas into reality much more easily. So you know you can [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2962.0s)]
*  Um, like, you know, you're making a movie. Let's say you have another movie idea. You can say you can ultimately [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2967.52s)]
*  I think you'll be able to tell an ai. Hey, I have this idea for a movie [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2972.7200000000003s)]
*  What could that look like? You know, maybe draft up a script [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2976.16s)]
*  um also who are the people who can help, you know fund this idea like who those people be can help reach out to them and [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2979.68s)]
*  then like, you know, who should we cast in it basically help make the whole thing a [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2986.56s)]
*  you know instead of those like daunting things that [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2991.76s)]
*  These big projects are usually so daunting [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2994.88s)]
*  You really don't know where to get started [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2996.96s)]
*  You kind of need a person to help you get through them [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=2998.2400000000002s)]
*  Instead of that ai will help you get through it and like help do a lot of the the sort of less glamorous work to make [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3000.88s)]
*  them a reality wow [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3006.0s)]
*  so I could say for example like um [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3007.84s)]
*  Like ai I would like to shoot maybe i'm thinking about creating an idea or shooting a film in this area [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3010.56s)]
*  Or it's like this it's going to take place in this type of place. I can give it the setting I can give it like a [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3016.7200000000003s)]
*  A outline of the characters like what they look like their ages and some description. Could you help give me? [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3022.08s)]
*  Um possible potential actors or something within a certain price range that I can maybe cast for that [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3028.16s)]
*  um, yeah [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3033.8399999999997s)]
*  Could you help give me like locations around the country that would fit that backdrop? Yep. Um, could you? [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3035.44s)]
*  uh [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3042.16s)]
*  List me all the talent agencies that I could reach out to and you can kind of just put those things in [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3043.8399999999997s)]
*  and then you would have [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3049.04s)]
*  Sort of a uh a bit of a guidebook at that point that would make your [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3051.04s)]
*  Yeah, what before was something that felt extremely daunting. Yeah shit in two minutes [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3055.6s)]
*  You know and then you put it in ai gives you the information back in a few minutes and maybe you're [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3060.72s)]
*  And I think I think over time it'll also be able to start doing a lot of leg work for you [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3064.8s)]
*  So it'll be able to reach out to people for you. It'll be able to you know [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3068.72s)]
*  figure out the logistics it'll be able to to book things for you like it'll be able to basically [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3072.88s)]
*  Help do all the leg work to make it make you know, whatever it is into a reality [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3077.2799999999997s)]
*  So very much an assistant in a lot of ways. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah an assistant copilot [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3082.08s)]
*  You know the the hot word in the ai world is agents [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3087.6s)]
*  But you know, it's just it it'll be something that'll help you [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3090.56s)]
*  You know you humans are going to be in control humans are ultimately going to be telling the ai's what they want it to do [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3094.32s)]
*  And then you know, hey, what do we want? What do we want these ai's to do? [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3099.84s)]
*  It's ultimately going to be to like help us execute on and accomplish all these ideas that we have [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3103.12s)]
*  So a genius could be three or four x'd [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3109.04s)]
*  If somebody's like a genius in something in some realm or space of thought [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3111.6s)]
*  You could three or four x them because they like multiply their their output [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3116.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah from their own brain because they could have something really helping them [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3121.2s)]
*  Yeah, get done a lot of the like [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3125.8399999999997s)]
*  The early work on things and maybe some of the most severe work [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3128.48s)]
*  Yeah, totally like what I think one thing that [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3131.2799999999997s)]
*  I always feel like kind of sucks is that um, if you have a director you really like [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3134.24s)]
*  They're only going to make a movie once every couple of years [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3138.32s)]
*  So even if you have a director that you like think is amazing [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3140.56s)]
*  You know [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3143.36s)]
*  They just it's hard for them to make that many movies like because it just takes so much time and effort and you know [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3143.6s)]
*  Um, there's so many bottlenecks and stuff. So in a future with you know more advanced ai systems [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3149.6s)]
*  They could they could just churn them out and uh, they could they can make so many of their ideas into a reality [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3156.3199999999997s)]
*  And I think that's true not only in creative areas, but it's kind of true across the board like, you know [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3161.92s)]
*  You can start new businesses more easily you can [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3166.24s)]
*  Um, you know, you can make various creative projects that you have happened more easily [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3169.04s)]
*  You can make like you can you can finally plan that event that you and your friends have been talking about for like, you know [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3172.96s)]
*  Years and years so it can just like really help you [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3178.88s)]
*  You know we think about was like giving humans more agency giving humans more sort of sovereignty and just and just enabling humans to get [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3182.56s)]
*  Way more done. Hmm [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3189.52s)]
*  Yeah, that's a great way. I like some of this thought because yeah [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3191.92s)]
*  I could be like like my fantasy football group and I we do a um [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3195.52s)]
*  We do a uh draft every year in a different location, you know, and shout out pae. That's our fantasy league [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3199.12s)]
*  Jay rod everybody that's in it for the past 17 years. We've flown to a city each year and done a draft in person, right? [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3205.12s)]
*  um [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3211.44s)]
*  But I could say hey, uh, we have 10 guys. We want to go to a nice place. We want there to be a beach [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3213.04s)]
*  um [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3218.4s)]
*  This is the age group of our group. Uh, you know, these would kind of be the nights and you know [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3219.52s)]
*  just to really give me like a [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3224.1600000000003s)]
*  Just a nice plan of hey, here's 10 possibilities, right something like that and then even more like with a movie [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3226.1600000000003s)]
*  This is what I wore you'd run into say if i'd be like, okay [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3231.6800000000003s)]
*  I have two main characters and this is kind of what I would like to happen. Could you help me with a first? [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3234.32s)]
*  Act of a three-act movie [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3240.08s)]
*  How do you know everybody just doesn't get the same movie then like that's what I would start to worry that everything that you have [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3243.28s)]
*  To create is all going to be very similar [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3249.04s)]
*  Yeah [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3251.44s)]
*  So then I think this is where it comes into like this is where human creativity is going to matter because it's going to be about [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3251.76s)]
*  Then it's about like okay. What is the how am I? [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3258.4s)]
*  You know, how am I directing the ai system? [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3262.0s)]
*  Like what are my what are the tricks I have to make the ai give me something that's different and unique [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3264.2400000000002s)]
*  And that's that's not different at all from you know, how? [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3269.36s)]
*  Creative stuff works today like even on social media or you know anywhere, you know this like you still add your own spice to it [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3272.6400000000003s)]
*  You need yeah, you need an angle. You always need to like have something that's going to make it like different and interesting and new [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3277.92s)]
*  Um, so that's not going to change like we're humans are always going to have to figure out [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3284.8s)]
*  Based on where culture is at based on where you know, what the dialogue is what the what the discourse is all that kind of stuff [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3288.48s)]
*  What is my fresh take? [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3294.96s)]
*  That's where that's really one of the key things that humans are going to have to keep doing no matter what right and [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3296.7999999999997s)]
*  And some of the like a lot of films and books [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3302.3999999999996s)]
*  a lot of it is there's just like a problem there's a there's [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3305.7599999999998s)]
*  maybe a [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3309.7599999999998s)]
*  Information you learn there's a red herring and then there's a solution like that's a lot of stories, right? So [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3311.2s)]
*  If something just gave you the basis and then you go through and make everything your own [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3317.8399999999997s)]
*  Um because a lot of things we don't there's only so many templates for things [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3323.12s)]
*  um [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3327.04s)]
*  Huh? Yeah [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3328.48s)]
*  So so say for example say you might need to hire people at a company then that would help direct your ai like somebody who's good at [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3329.6s)]
*  Managing ai. Yeah, uh and giving it the best prompts or the best way to ask it questions. Yeah [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3338.94s)]
*  To get the perfect feedback for your company. Yeah, so those would be new jobs [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3346.2400000000002s)]
*  Those would be actual new people you would need. Yeah, so so tons of new jobs, right? [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3351.12s)]
*  well first I think just like helping to [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3355.44s)]
*  you know kind of what we're talking about before these jobs around helping to improve the data and and [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3358.8s)]
*  Contribute to the ai systems. That's just going to keep growing for a long long time [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3364.86s)]
*  And then as ai gets better and it gets used in more areas then you're there are going to be a lot of jobs [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3369.92s)]
*  That pop up just exactly as you're saying which is how do you [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3376.2400000000002s)]
*  What's the best way to use this as a tool? What's the best way to leverage it to you know? [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3379.7599999999998s)]
*  Actually make some of these uh, these applications or you know, whatever you want to build a reality [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3385.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, and then and then there's going to be folks who need to the ones those are built like how do you keep improving it? [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3391.2799999999997s)]
*  How do you keep making it better? How do you keep? [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3396.72s)]

*  Like how do you make sure that the ai doesn't accidentally spam a million people or whatever it might be [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3406.08s)]
*  Um, and you make sure that it sort of is uh, like operating in a good way [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3411.28s)]

*  Oh my gosh. Yeah. Yeah, so that's gonna get alarming dude [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3689.04s)]
*  That's gonna get hella alarming. That's a movie right there. It is but it's almost like you could make like that's what I want to get [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3693.76s)]
*  I want to get somebody to help us think [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3699.6s)]
*  Hey, don't make these little segments that we can take our creativity [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3702.08s)]
*  And instead of me thinking man, I gotta write this huge crazy script for just to kind of small things [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3705.76s)]
*  You know little moments. Yeah, can you help me make this happen? [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3709.92s)]
*  I think that's actually the key thing which is ai like ai will just be something that we turn to to help make [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3713.12s)]
*  Our dreams happen like we help make our ideas and our dreams and our you know, whatever we want to do happen more easily [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3720.64s)]
*  Got it. That's like at the core what it'll be. Yeah [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3726.32s)]
*  Um, who's the who's the current leader in ai development? Like is it america? [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3730.4s)]
*  Is it china is it israel is it trying to think of another superpower russia maybe [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3736.0s)]
*  Um, or yeah, who is it taiwan? I know has a lot of the chips [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3743.44s)]
*  Yeah, and they manufacture a lot of the chips over there [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3746.88s)]
*  um, and does it matter what country leads in ai or does it just matter the [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3749.52s)]
*  company like scale or another ai company so [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3756.24s)]
*  Does that make sense that question totally totally. Yeah, so so today america is in the lead but um, [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3761.2s)]
*  But china as a country is is sort of hot on our tails [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3768.08s)]
*  Like there was uh, there was all that news about deep seek a couple weeks ago and uh deep seek [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3772.0s)]
*  In still in most places around the world is the number one most downloaded app [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3777.4399999999996s)]
*  You know, it's downloaded a ton in everywhere around the world frankly, um, and is a chinese ai system, right? [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3781.4399999999996s)]
*  And so it's starting to rival a lot of the american ai systems also because it's free and you know it uh, [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3787.92s)]
*  It kind of like shocked the world. So [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3794.0s)]
*  Right now if you kind of look at it, um, us and china are are a little bit neck and neck [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3797.04s)]
*  Maybe the us and america is like a little bit ahead and you kind of like look at [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3802.88s)]
*  You know if you go back to each of the three pieces that I talked about so [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3807.76s)]
*  The chips and the computational power the data and the algorithms [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3811.52s)]
*  Um if you were to [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3815.7799999999997s)]
*  Rack and stack us versus china on each one of those, you know, we're probably [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3817.8599999999997s)]
*  We're ahead on the computational power because the united states is the leader at developing the chips and [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3822.18s)]
*  And most of the most advanced chips are american chips [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3828.5s)]
*  They probably beat us out on data [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3832.3399999999997s)]
*  Because china they've been investing into data for a very long time as a country and then on algorithms were basically neck and neck [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3835.54s)]
*  um, so [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3843.14s)]
*  It's a pretty tight race [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3844.98s)]
*  And you know to your question about does it matter or what does what does this mean? [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3847.38s)]
*  um, I uh, I think it's actually going to be one of the most important, uh, you know [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3852.6600000000003s)]
*  questions or most important races of our time is is it us or chinese ai that wins because [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3858.98s)]
*  You know ai is more than just being a tool that uh that you know [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3866.34s)]
*  We all we can all use to make our you know build whatever we want to or make whatever ideas we want to happen [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3870.82s)]
*  it's also [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3876.5s)]
*  You know, it's a it's a cultural [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3878.42s)]
*  Uh staple right, you know if you talk to an ai that ai is kind of a reflection of [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3880.98s)]
*  Our culture and our values and all that stuff [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3886.7400000000002s)]
*  So in america we value free speech and you know, the ai's are you know need to are built to support that whereas in [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3888.98s)]
*  in china there's [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3896.1800000000003s)]
*  There isn't free speech and so, um, you know if if the chinese ai's are the ones that take over the world then [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3897.86s)]
*  All these chinese ideologies are going to become exported all around the world and and so so first is there's a couple dimensions here [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3904.42s)]
*  That I think matters. So first is just the cultural element, which is like do we want [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3912.42s)]
*  Kind of democracy and free speech, um to be the the cultural ai that wins or do we want sort of the more? [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3917.2200000000003s)]
*  You know frankly totalitarian ai's in china to be the ones that win and then there's sort of the um [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3924.34s)]
*  there's like the [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3931.38s)]
*  You know you start getting to economically so ai is going to be something that helps [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3932.66s)]
*  All the companies in the united states thrive and so if the usa i wins then we're gonna you know [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3938.7400000000002s)]
*  The economy will grow faster. We're gonna have more and more opportunity, you know [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3944.5s)]
*  The country will still be better and better and better [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3948.1s)]
*  And and [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3950.58s)]
*  The economy will keep growing [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3951.86s)]
*  Reverses if chinese ai wins then chinese economy is going to grow way faster than the american economy [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3953.46s)]
*  So there's sort of the the cultural piece the economic piece and then lastly there's there's the there's kind of the [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3958.18s)]
*  warfare piece right and you know ai [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3964.98s)]
*  We haven't really talked about it, but has clear potential to be used as a military technology [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3968.66s)]
*  And we don't want [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3974.34s)]
*  You know, we don't want uh another country to have [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3976.34s)]
*  Because they use they have better ai to have a much stronger military than than america's so [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3979.94s)]
*  Like how would they do that? [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3984.9s)]
*  How would they have a better ai or how they use it to? [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3987.06s)]
*  Have a better military. Yeah, how would they use it to have a better military? [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3990.02s)]
*  Like why is that kind of a concern or potential concern? [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3993.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, so so one of the things that's been happening over the past, you know [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=3996.18s)]
*  Decade for sure is uh is lots of hacking cyber hacking going on. So [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4000.66s)]
*  You know in america [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4006.34s)]
*  Even recently we had this huge cyber hack called salt typhoon where um where the chinese hacked our [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4008.82s)]
*  Telecommunications company so hacked our for the phone companies damn they did [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4016.42s)]
*  Yeah, and they got all sorts of crazy data as a result of that. Oh, they know i'm a pervert [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4020.26s)]
*  I'll tell you that yeah, look at this. It's happening 2020 salt typhoon is in it is widely understood to be operated by china's ministry [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4026.42s)]
*  state of security [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4032.98s)]
*  Um, it's foreign intelligence service and secret police chinese embassy denied all allegations saying it was unfounded irresponsible smears and slanders [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4034.74s)]
*  um [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4042.1s)]
*  high-profile [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4043.14s)]
*  cyber espionage [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4044.58s)]
*  um [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4046.66s)]
*  In 2024 u.s officials announced that hackers affiliated with salt typhoon had accessed the computer systems of nine u.s [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4047.62s)]
*  Telecommunications companies later acknowledged to include verizon at and tt mobile spectrum [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4054.0s)]
*  lumen consolidated communications and windstream [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4059.14s)]
*  The hackers were able to access metadata of users calls and text messages. Fuck homie. We're fucked dude. I am you seem good [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4062.02s)]
*  Including date and time stamps source and destination ip addresses [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4069.3s)]
*  Uh shit keep going keep going [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4074.1s)]
*  And phone numbers from over a million users most of which were located in washington dc good [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4077.22s)]
*  Light them up dude [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4082.18s)]
*  In some cases the hackers were able to obtain audio recordings of telephone calls made by high profile individuals [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4083.62s)]
*  Possible [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4089.0s)]
*  Such individuals reportedly included staff of the kamala heiress 2024 presidential campaign as well as phones belonged to donald trump and jd vance [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4090.04s)]
*  according to deputy national security advisor and [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4097.8s)]
*  Newburger a large number of the individuals whose data was directly accessed were government targets of interest. Wow [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4100.9s)]
*  Yeah, that's great. So do you think this also that that whole thing could be [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4107.4s)]
*  Not real and it's just a story that was created [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4113.24s)]
*  Uh, that seems pretty real because there's there's real there like, uh, I mean there's like 20 stories where uh, [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4115.4s)]
*  Where the chinese have have hacked american systems like they hacked [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4123.0s)]
*  This was uh, this must have been close to 10 years ago now, but the chinese hacked the [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4127.5599999999995s)]
*  Database in america that stored all of the clearances [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4133.62s)]
*  So they hacked in they they managed to hack into knowing who are literally all of the americans who have security clearance [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4138.38s)]
*  Oh security clearance. Yeah, so I thought even what was on sale. I was like who cares? [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4145.5s)]
*  That's great though. Damn. Oh damn. So they knew everybody who had who knew [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4150.94s)]
*  Oh who knew information who knew secrets? Yeah, so once they knew that then they know it [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4156.22s)]
*  Well, that's a great point of operation to go then well now let's get find their data. They can just hack all of them [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4159.98s)]
*  Yeah, so so they so already china is hacking the shit out of america. That is definitely not an understatement [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4164.94s)]
*  Yeah, it's exciting kind of I mean, it's unfortunate, but it's also exciting. I like some espionage, you know [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4172.219999999999s)]
*  I can't sleep unless somebody's fucking really going through it [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4177.179999999999s)]

*  So ai can be used to do that because you can like prompt it to go [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4184.139999999999s)]
*  And do things like that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, there's there's a bunch of recent because it's all data [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4188.54s)]
*  Yeah, there's a bunch of recent demonstrations where ai [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4193.179999999999s)]
*  Is just like how in in go how ai beat the world's best go players ai starting to beat the world's best cyber hackers? [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4196.94s)]
*  And the world's best. Yeah, so it's uh, I don't know if you saw mr. Robot [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4205.179999999999s)]
*  Um, I didn't but I dm'd with magnus carl, magnus carlson. No, that's cool. Pretty cool. So but no mr. Robot. Is it good? [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4209.9s)]
*  Uh, it's it's just it it shows like all this hacking stuff and like, you know, cool. It makes it seem really cool [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4216.46s)]

*  How do we how much do we have to fear? [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4467.98s)]
*  Say if a certain country or a certain company owns an ai right in that country and that company [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4470.459999999999s)]
*  If they're chinese if they um have a certain religious belief or they have uh [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4478.7s)]
*  Information that they don't they want to adjust history [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4485.74s)]
*  How much would a company be able to like say they keep certain data out of their information system? [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4490.459999999999s)]
*  Um, but and then after a while if you're if that's the company that kind of takes the lead [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4497.26s)]
*  In ai are one of the main ones [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4503.1s)]
*  then [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4505.820000000001s)]
*  The truth could disappear [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4507.26s)]
*  Is that true that if somebody loaded it just with the data that wasn't factual that we could start to [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4509.42s)]
*  Not have the truth. Is that does that make any sense or no? Yeah, totally. I think this is this is something that um [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4516.14s)]
*  It's definitely the right thing to worry about so [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4522.9400000000005s)]
*  so [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4525.1s)]
*  First off if you ask any chinese ai system [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4526.3s)]
*  So any ai system that comes out of china if you ask any of them about you know a question about [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4529.34s)]
*  President xi the you know the the leader of the chinese government or you ask them any question about you know [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4535.66s)]
*  Tiananmen square or you know all these like key historical or or you know cultural things relevant to china [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4541.26s)]
*  um, it'll say it can't talk about them because there's [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4548.3s)]
*  Regulation in china that if you talk about some of these things like you're you're gonna get shut down [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4552.299999999999s)]
*  You're gonna have a really bad day. There's like cases where um, the chinese government disappears people [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4558.139999999999s)]
*  Which we don't have as them but they do disappear. So there's [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4564.46s)]
*  This is part of the thing that's worrying especially about um [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4569.179999999999s)]
*  China versus us even before you get into any of the military stuff that we're talking about. It's just like the chinese [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4573.179999999999s)]
*  Chinese ai systems are censored and are gonna you know be you know, they're going to they're gonna erase certain historical elements [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4580.94s)]
*  Or they're gonna be um [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4589.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, look at that. This is deep seek and you ask it is president xi of china good guy [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4591.259999999999s)]
*  Sorry, that's beyond my scope. Let's talk about something else. Oh, let's talk about something not only does it say it's beyond my scope [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4596.7s)]
*  It says let's talk about something else. That's right. That's interesting. That's a good [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4601.339999999999s)]
*  Great hey, let's talk about something else, huh? Wow get this yow ming jersey, homie [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4606.7s)]
*  um [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4612.54s)]
*  But and people always people also have to remember about china that they are [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4613.58s)]
*  That's their whole government their whole system is like that [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4617.42s)]
*  So sometimes when people are like china does this but that's how they're built right? [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4619.82s)]
*  They're built to like only give out certain information to their people and to um [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4623.58s)]
*  Have communism, right? Yeah. Yeah [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4628.46s)]
*  So I mean but that could also happen with american companies, right? [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4630.7s)]
*  We can have an american company that owns it and they only want certain information in there that could happen anywhere like china [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4633.58s)]
*  That's probably going to be because that's their mo sort of yeah in china. It's regulated. So basically [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4638.3s)]
*  Like you the government has control they have control. Okay, so so um [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4644.06s)]

*  so um [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4717.42s)]
*  So in china there it's like this is [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4718.9400000000005s)]

*  So it's basically [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4842.46s)]
*  Yeah, it's just like erasing their culture, you know pulling them into china [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4844.38s)]
*  Um, it's awful. Every place has done this over the years and that's just that's the craziest thing about history [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4848.94s)]
*  It's like every place is guilty of this same thing. Totally and it just it's it's unfortunate [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4854.46s)]
*  So it's it's hard to point fingers, you know, I mean you can point them [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4860.3s)]
*  But you have to point one at your own people as well [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4862.78s)]
*  But that's the thing where if you ask like it if you ask a chinese ai [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4865.74s)]
*  It's not going to tell you about that and it won't it won't come clean about that. Whereas thankfully in in [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4870.46s)]
*  america at least when [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4876.54s)]
*  we see [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4878.86s)]
*  People or groups of people or countries doing bad things we can call it out. We can talk about it [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4879.98s)]
*  We can make sure it doesn't happen in the future [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4883.98s)]

*  That's one of the things that's that could happen that could happen. It's like you you could have I mean, it's kind of dystopian [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4889.74s)]
*  But you know, I think there's a real case where let's say the chinese ai [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4895.259999999999s)]
*  Is the winning ai like we're all using chinese ai and then all of a sudden we're like [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4899.9s)]
*  We were shut out from information about what are like awful things happening in the world or what awful things the government's doing like [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4905.26s)]
*  We might just not be able to know about what's going on [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4911.34s)]

*  And then you continue to it continues to feed it to you [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4952.62s)]
*  um, do you fear that that could happen uh to ai from our government like have you been approached by the government to try and [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4956.06s)]
*  Because you work with the government some right we work with the government. Yeah [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4962.38s)]
*  We were yeah, we work a lot with uh with the government to make sure that they're using these ais and they're actually like [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4966.22s)]
*  You know to as to my point on we don't want trying to get the jump on us [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4972.38s)]
*  On ai used for all these, you know, all these nefarious purposes. So we gotta make sure that our ai is is uh is advancing faster [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4976.860000000001s)]
*  Um, is that one of your biggest employers or is that employer employee? Is that one of your biggest customers? [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4984.78s)]

*  Um, not our biggest but uh, but they're an important one. I mean I I grew up in a government lab town. So [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=4993.9800000000005s)]
*  so it's uh [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5000.54s)]

*  Um, do you do has the government tried to say that we need to make sure that like could that happen in our country where? [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5039.9s)]
*  The government also curtails what's? [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5045.34s)]
*  um [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5047.74s)]

*  obviously like you know, you gotta we have to we have to make sure that we uphold all our values right and that we [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5049.9800000000005s)]
*  Maintain free speech and we maintain free press and all these things but um [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5055.66s)]
*  As right now no, I don't think I don't think that's a risk in the in the united states. Awesome [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5060.06s)]
*  Thanks for this information. Um, you hear about like chip makers in video all the time taiwan [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5064.54s)]
*  That place is just a hotbed for [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5070.46s)]
*  Uh chips, why is it a hotbed for chips? [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5073.18s)]
*  Yeah, so one of the the biggest companies in the world is this company called, uh taiwan [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5076.46s)]
*  Semiconductor. Yeah tsm i've seen them tsmc. Yeah, so they're they're um, I mean it's it's like a trillion dollar company [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5083.24s)]
*  based in taiwan and it's uh, that is where [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5090.46s)]
*  Almost all of the high-end chips for ai that you know [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5093.74s)]
*  We're kind of we're kind of talking about all of them are manufactured there [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5097.58s)]
*  They have these they have the most advanced think about them as factories like the most advanced chip factories in the world [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5101.179999999999s)]
*  They're called fabs or fabricators, but basically these huge factories that are like, you know, there's all sorts of crazy stuff. So [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5107.259999999999s)]
*  They have the most expensive machines in the world. They're machines that cost hundreds of millions of dollars in there. They have [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5115.0199999999995s)]
*  They build them because uh, so that you know the chips they have to be made at at the like [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5120.86s)]
*  Finest levels and very very precisely. Yeah, you need small hands [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5127.0199999999995s)]
*  Probably, huh? You need well that and there's like these machines that um, [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5131.259999999999s)]
*  That at the nanometer level make like little marks and etches on top of and they have those they have those [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5134.94s)]
*  Yeah, those are super expensive machines. So that so um the [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5141.42s)]
*  It's it's crazy. Yes, but the but it's so it's the the machinery is so precise that um, [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5145.82s)]
*  Even if there's like a little bit of like seismic movement a little earthquake or a little bit of movement [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5152.94s)]
*  It can fuck up the whole machine [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5157.98s)]
*  So they have to build the the buildings build the factories in a way such that there's like [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5159.58s)]
*  Like the whole building doesn't move even if there's like a little earthquake or a little shake from the earth [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5166.0599999999995s)]
*  So it's like is this crazy crazy engineering? [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5171.66s)]
*  um, and so that's so these all these giant factories are in taiwan and that's where [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5175.179999999999s)]
*  Basically like a hundred percent of all the advanced ai chips are made [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5181.099999999999s)]
*  So that's why taiwan matters so much got it, but then the reasons a hotbed is that um, [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5185.0199999999995s)]
*  Uh the the people's republic of china the prc [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5191.34s)]
*  Uh has a very own taiwan, right? [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5195.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean true or not. I might make that there there's a there's a complicated relationship between taiwan and and china where [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5198.38s)]
*  Type, you know if you ask people in taiwan, they they want to be independent [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5205.099999999999s)]
*  they want to be their own country, but um, but the people republic's people's republic of china has a [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5208.3s)]
*  Sort of a reunification plan that they want to bring taiwan [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5215.0199999999995s)]
*  Back into their country and be back a part of china [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5219.42s)]
*  So it's kind of it's kind of like potentially, you know, thankfully there's there's no war yet, but there's a risk still talking to your ex [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5221.74s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. There's a risk. It becomes like russia ukraine or you know, one of these really really bad situations [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5230.38s)]
*  um, so [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5236.54s)]
*  So that's what's scary. What's scary is that? [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5238.3s)]
*  That that china a china wants to you know, [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5241.26s)]
*  Either invade or bring bring taiwan back into its country [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5245.26s)]
*  um, and there have been you know, um president xi has has ordered his military [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5249.74s)]
*  To get ready to do that before 2027 [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5256.22s)]
*  now [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5259.82s)]
*  we don't know what's going to happen, but you know if a [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5260.78s)]
*  Extremely powerful world leader says to get something ready by 2027 you kind of [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5263.9s)]
*  Read between the lines a little bit. Yeah, um and uh, [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5268.38s)]
*  and that's part of it is is uh, obviously it'd be you know, we don't want to enable them to to take over this island [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5272.219999999999s)]
*  but then the other thing that's scary is um china may view it as a way to [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5279.82s)]
*  Just like win on ai because if they take over the island with all of these [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5285.0199999999995s)]
*  Very these giant factories all the chips, baby. They'll get all the chips frito lamborghini, baby. They'd be running it all [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5290.0599999999995s)]
*  They'd be running it all. Yeah [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5296.3s)]
*  Wow [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5297.42s)]

*  Would you think they could regulate the amount of chips that you're allowed to have? [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5361.02s)]
*  So this is a hot topic globally actually really? [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5364.54s)]

*  560 interviews we got a good question [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5375.0s)]
*  This is one of the hottest topics in dc right now, uh is [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5377.88s)]
*  What what are we going to do about how many chips other people are allowed to have because because [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5382.44s)]
*  Almost all the chips are american chips. So they're all they all are american chips and technically [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5387.8s)]
*  We own most of them. Yeah, exactly. But china owns most of them too. They're china has their own [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5394.92s)]
*  Uh has their own chip industry, but it's behind ours. Okay. Got it. Yeah [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5399.8s)]
*  So [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5403.799999999999s)]
*  So the united states has the has the most advanced chips as you know [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5404.5199999999995s)]
*  These chips are the envy of the world everybody in the world wants our chips and uh, one of the big questions is [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5407.799999999999s)]
*  you know, do we [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5414.599999999999s)]
*  Does the government allow a lot of these chips to go over overseas to? [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5416.679999999999s)]
*  china or parts of asia or the middle east or wherever or do we want to [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5421.32s)]
*  Make sure they stay in america and make sure that we win in america [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5426.36s)]
*  and this is a [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5430.12s)]
*  Super duper, you know, they're called export controls. Yeah [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5431.88s)]
*  Because it's a possibility to run it all. Yeah, exactly. You've got the chips. What do you think about it? [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5436.04s)]
*  um [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5441.96s)]
*  it's a complicated [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5443.0s)]
*  complicated thing because basically, you know one argument is [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5445.06s)]
*  um [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5449.56s)]
*  We shouldn't be throwing our weight around in this way like, you know, maybe it's it's fine [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5450.76s)]
*  It's a free market like if other people want our chips [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5455.4800000000005s)]
*  They should be able to get our chips and that way [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5457.8s)]
*  You know the world is running on american chips that that can be good in some ways and it helps make sure that [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5460.4400000000005s)]
*  You know helps bolster our economy our industry [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5466.68s)]
*  but the other way to look at it is hey ai is [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5469.24s)]
*  Really really important that america wins at and we don't want to like let's not [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5472.76s)]
*  Give other people any advantages or let's make sure that we win [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5478.12s)]
*  And then and then we can figure out what we're going to do with all the chips. So [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5482.04s)]
*  You can see both sides of it, right and there's like all sorts, you know, even beyond that [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5485.56s)]
*  there's like 50 different arguments on both sides of the of the conversation but um, [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5490.200000000001s)]
*  You know where I go where I come from on it is like [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5495.96s)]
*  Let's let's make sure america wins and let's start from there and then figure out what we need to do to win [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5498.6s)]
*  Are there uses of ai that you feel like cross the line kind of [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5506.120000000001s)]
*  um [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5510.84s)]
*  I definitely think like uh [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5512.280000000001s)]
*  well [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5514.68s)]
*  I I worry a lot about this kind of like [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5515.88s)]
*  Uh, you know, maybe brainwashing kind of thing like I don't want [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5518.84s)]
*  I don't want ai's [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5523.400000000001s)]
*  that are specifically programmed to [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5525.08s)]
*  Make me think a certain thing or persuade me to do a certain thing and that could happen that could happen [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5527.88s)]
*  Yeah, so i'm really worried about this kind of like deception [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5533.64s)]
*  and persuasion from ai's like I don't want ai's that are lying to me or [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5537.64s)]
*  Uh that are sort of that are like that are kind of like [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5543.320000000001s)]
*  Nudging me or or persuading me to do things that I don't want to do or I shouldn't be doing [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5547.0s)]
*  That's what I worry about because it could happen. We don't realize how easily we're influenced little things that influence us [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5551.24s)]
*  Yeah, and even just a turning of a phrase or a little bit of this or [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5556.68s)]
*  Pointing you to a couple of lengths in your life could lead you down a whole world. It's kind of [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5560.76s)]
*  It's pretty fascinating. So people that could [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5565.16s)]
*  people that had [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5568.2s)]
*  How do you keep your ai? [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5570.360000000001s)]
*  Clean, how do you guys keep your ai clean? Well, this is where it goes back to a the data [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5572.5199999999995s)]
*  Okay, so you got to make sure that that data to your point the large body of water is as clean as as as [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5577.32s)]
*  As pristine as possible. You got lifeguards on it. Yeah, you got lifeguards. We got filters. We got we got game wardens. Yeah [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5584.839999999999s)]
*  Um, so so the big part of it is about the data and the second part is I think we have to just [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5592.44s)]
*  We have to constantly be testing the ai system. So [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5597.48s)]
*  Um, we have to we have to like we constantly are running tests on ai to see hey is there are they [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5600.52s)]
*  unsafe in some way, you know one of the one of the tests that we run a lot, uh is [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5608.12s)]
*  and this is like, you know across the industry is like [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5613.64s)]
*  um [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5616.76s)]
*  Our ai's helping people do really nefarious things and we're making sure that they don't so, you know [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5617.72s)]
*  If somebody asks an ai hey help me make a bomb or help me make like a like covid [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5623.64s)]
*  Like 2.0 or whatnot that the ai is not helping you do that. So [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5630.2s)]
*  so we run a lot of tests to make sure that it doesn't help in those areas and then um, [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5635.4800000000005s)]
*  And then we make sure the data is really clean so that there's no [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5640.2s)]
*  There's no sort of like little bit or piece of that that makes its way to the model [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5643.88s)]
*  Without lyre, that's your program. Yep without lyre [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5648.76s)]
*  How are you how are what type of people are applying for those jobs? [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5651.96s)]
*  Can people just log on and start to and submit applications like how does that work to become a [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5655.48s)]
*  information [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5661.0599999999995s)]
*  Sorcerer. Yeah, we call them contributors. Okay information contributor. Everybody's kind of contributing to the ai's everyone's contributing to the data [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5662.28s)]
*  That goes into the ai's. Um, it's kind of like I almost think about like the next generation of wikipedia, right? We're like, um [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5670.12s)]
*  Yeah, look at this and we're hiring people all around the world. So people in all sorts of different languages [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5678.04s)]

*  Start to become [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5818.76s)]
*  You know just get a head start on what could potentially be probably a lot of job opportunities. I'm guessing [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5821.56s)]
*  Yeah, like in the ai space, right? Yeah, is it just is it just engineers? Like is it just mathematicians like [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5826.12s)]
*  No, it's everybody because yeah as we were talking about like ai needs to get smarter about literally everything so [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5833.24s)]
*  What are the colleges offering court? Like is there do you know like is there specific places where people can because that's another thing [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5840.28s)]
*  I think it's like i'm gonna work in ai and you're like, what do I do? You know, yeah [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5845.8s)]
*  Yeah, I I don't think these programs exist yet. I mean we we would definitely love to help build them [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5849.72s)]
*  So I guess if any colleges are listening, you know, and you want to help figure out about these programs [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5854.84s)]
*  We'd love we'd love to help that'd be pretty cool [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5860.04s)]
*  If you had your own kind of like course not yet to teach it all that, you know [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5861.96s)]
*  But you were like a partner of it somehow. Yeah, I mean, I think we'd love to to basically teach [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5864.6s)]
*  Everybody in america how to best contribute to the ai's how to how to best [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5869.56s)]
*  Basically take advantage of the fact that this is going to be one of the fastest growing industries [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5874.28s)]
*  There's gonna be tons of opportunities. They're gonna be shaped a little bit different from you know, the jobs that exist today [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5878.92s)]
*  But you know, it's not going to be that hard for everybody to learn and figure out how to participate in it [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5884.28s)]
*  What are some jobs that could that could be at risk because of ai right? [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5889.64s)]
*  Because you start thinking that like yeah before I was talking to you [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5892.84s)]
*  There's this general fear of like everything could be at risk, right? [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5895.88s)]
*  Um, but when you think about it, you're like, yeah, these are some jobs that I mean they won't disappear [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5899.0s)]
*  But there might be less of them, right? [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5903.32s)]
*  I just think it'll be um [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5905.4s)]
*  It'll be we'll be doing like a different thing. So [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5907.5599999999995s)]
*  Because a lot of our fans are probably just blue collar listeners like like there's people that work and like you're not gonna [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5910.92s)]
*  You're still gonna need a plumber. He's still gonna need an electrician [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5915.5599999999995s)]
*  You're still gonna need anything where you have to physically do something. You're probably still gonna need [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5917.8s)]
*  Yeah for sure and then even stuff where you're like, let's say you're you're mostly just working on a laptop and you know [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5921.88s)]
*  um, even for those jobs like it'll just change like instead of being [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5928.5199999999995s)]
*  Instead of my job being like hey, I have to do the work. I have literally do the work on a laptop [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5933.160000000001s)]
*  It'll almost be like everybody gets [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5937.72s)]
*  promoted to being a manager like because i'm going to be managing like a [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5940.4400000000005s)]
*  a little pod of [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5945.240000000001s)]
*  10 ai agents that are doing the work that I used to do [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5946.6s)]
*  but I need to make sure that all of them are doing it right and that [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5950.280000000001s)]
*  They're not making any mistakes and that you know, if they're making mistakes [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5953.320000000001s)]
*  I'm helping them, you know get around those mistakes like like it's just gonna [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5956.52s)]
*  The way I think about it is that like yeah like literally [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5960.84s)]
*  Over time everybody will just be upgraded to being a manager or sort of promoted to being a manager [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5965.08s)]
*  Can you have that many managers you think? [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5970.28s)]
*  yeah, because I think that what's the other thing that's going to happen is the um [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5972.76s)]
*  The economy is just going to grow so much like there's going to be there's going to be so much like there will be [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5977.16s)]
*  like industries are going to pop off in crazy crazy ways and so [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5983.96s)]
*  You know the limit is going to be how many ai's can you have? [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5988.6s)]
*  and then you're going to be limited for in terms of the number of ai's you have by the number of managers that you have so [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5992.76s)]
*  it's gonna [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=5999.64s)]
*  Uh, it's gonna because you need air traffic controllers. You need as many as many of as you can have [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6001.160000000001s)]
*  Yeah, well that that definitely but but you're right [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6006.4400000000005s)]
*  but I mean in any field you're gonna need like just more managing more people to oversee and make sure that these that different things are [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6009.4800000000005s)]
*  Happening because some of the smaller tasks will just be outsourced [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6015.96s)]
*  Yeah, and just so much more stuff is going to be happening, right? [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6020.12s)]
*  And that's kind of right because yeah, once these things are all kind of taking care of more things can happen at this second level [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6022.84s)]
*  Yep, that's a good point. Yeah, you don't think about that once some of the things at the first level of of a [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6029.0s)]
*  Of certain businesses are handled. Yep [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6034.2s)]
*  More easily by ai [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6037.0s)]
*  Then you're going to be able to have more people operating at a higher level. Yeah, totally [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6039.24s)]
*  It's kind of like it's kind of like always the history of technology like when when we started developing technology that that started [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6044.36s)]
*  Making farming a lot more efficient all of a sudden [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6052.679999999999s)]
*  You know [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6056.679999999999s)]
*  People could do a lot of other things other than farming and then you know [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6057.5599999999995s)]
*  All of a sudden we have big entertainment industries and make financial industries and you know barbecue cook-offs, man [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6061.48s)]
*  I'll tell you that second some of those guys got the weekend off. They was grilling [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6066.92s)]
*  That I knew but yeah, so it's all about like us [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6071.56s)]
*  Yeah, everybody leveling up to be managers and then also everybody, you know [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6075.240000000001s)]
*  Just way more ideas are going to start happening like way more ideas are going to start becoming a reality. And so [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6079.0s)]
*  Um, it'll be I think it'll be pretty exciting. Like I think it's just like a lot more stuff is going to happen [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6085.160000000001s)]
*  Yeah, what what what companies do you see like are there companies where? [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6089.8s)]
*  um, you're the youngest billionaire in [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6093.64s)]
*  The world ever no, is that true? Is that a weird statement? We can take it out if it is [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6097.08s)]
*  I'm not trying to talk about your money. I mean you you [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6102.04s)]
*  But you are is that true? [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6105.719999999999s)]
*  Uh, according to like some publications, but I don't know as a young entrepreneur, right and you've been very successful, you know the [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6107.4s)]
*  self-made [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6114.58s)]
*  um [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6115.799999999999s)]
*  Billionaire and we can take the word billionaire out later if you decide you don't want it in [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6117.24s)]
*  Um, I just don't know how certain people feel about that. Um, and the founder of [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6121.4s)]
*  of scale ai [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6126.679999999999s)]
*  Where do you invest like are you investing your money in certain places like certain fields that you see? [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6128.44s)]
*  Continuing to do well [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6133.719999999999s)]
*  um [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6135.639999999999s)]
*  so I most of almost all of what i'm focused on is like how do we scale how do we make it super successful but [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6136.759999999999s)]
*  and make sure that we [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6143.96s)]
*  You know one of the things i'm I think is really important is like how do we make sure we [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6145.24s)]
*  Create as much opportunity through ai as possible. Like how do we make sure there's as much jobs? [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6148.839999999999s)]
*  How do we make sure that everything that we're talking about actually is what happens because I think no [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6153.08s)]
*  Someone's gonna have to really work to make sure all these jobs show up and all this all this stuff actually happens the way [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6158.5199999999995s)]
*  We're talking about so there's gonna be new industries that are gonna pop up even totally. Yeah [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6162.84s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I think like just in the same way that um, you know [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6166.92s)]
*  It's hard. Nobody could have really predicted that podcasting was gonna be this huge thing and this huge cultural movement. Yes, true [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6171.24s)]
*  um, but it is one and it's amazing and it's like awesome and uh [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6178.92s)]
*  And that's gonna happen in like little ways in all sorts of different industries [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6183.32s)]
*  Um, and that's gonna be it's gonna be really exciting [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6187.08s)]
*  Uh, what are some of the things that excite you about technology right now? [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6189.8s)]
*  Like what are where do you see like ai and technology in five years ten years? [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6193.08s)]
*  Yeah, so um some of the areas I think are really uh are really exciting. So one is definitely [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6198.28s)]
*  everything to do with [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6203.88s)]
*  healthcare and biology [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6205.24s)]
*  that's moving really really fast and kind of as we were talking about like I I think [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6207.24s)]
*  Legitimately in our lifetimes we could see cancer being cured [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6212.34s)]
*  We could see heart disease being cured like we could see some really crazy leaps and advancements [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6216.92s)]
*  Um in that area, which is which is super duper exciting. Could it create a way that we could live forever? Do you think? [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6222.84s)]
*  Uh, that's just it. There's definitely people working on that. Um, you know [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6229.400000000001s)]
*  Uh, there's so this is getting kind of crazy and very sci-fi but um [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6234.2s)]
*  Some people think that there's there's a way [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6240.04s)]
*  For us to keep rewinding the clocks on ourselves [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6242.759999999999s)]
*  So that we'll always feel young and like all of our cells will actually always stay young [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6247.88s)]
*  It's I think scientifically possible but um, and and I think if we can get there that's obviously [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6255.08s)]
*  Incredible. Um, so there's people working on that. I think that's uh at the very least I think we'll be able to lengthen [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6261.0599999999995s)]
*  Um our our lifespans pretty dramatically and and maybe we could get to that [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6267.96s)]
*  Yeah, yeah [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6273.48s)]
*  Because I always envision this there's like a time where it's like, okay [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6274.28s)]
*  This group lives forever and this group doesn't and there's just that parting of two different ways [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6277.16s)]
*  You know people head not in just into the end zone of the lord and then there's other people just loiter [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6281.639999999999s)]
*  Who's going to be loitering around for a long time? [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6286.5199999999995s)]
*  And what that would be like that cutoff, you know, I yeah, it's kind of I mean I [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6289.16s)]
*  I'm not that worried about it, but it it sucks to be that cutoff. We're like maybe [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6293.96s)]
*  Maybe yeah, maybe yeah, it's a weird. It's a weird thought [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6299.08s)]
*  Um, because it would also be brave. I mean you'd be the astronaut. I mean [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6302.599999999999s)]
*  Dying you're just an astronaut really into the ether. You don't know what's going on [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6306.36s)]
*  Yeah, you know you to lewis and clark at a lord at that point you were out there [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6310.44s)]
*  Yeah, and then if you stay you kind of are always going to be no [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6314.599999999999s)]
*  You'll always know kind of what's going to happen in a way because you'll be here. Yeah, which would be exciting [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6317.5599999999995s)]
*  I think but then after a while you might be like dang what happens if you die? [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6322.68s)]
*  That's the bravest choice you could make that's true. Probably. Yeah, how did you see ai having any effect on religion? [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6326.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I think um, I think one of the things that [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6334.52s)]
*  Uh something I believe is like I I think that as ai becomes [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6339.64s)]
*  You know [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6347.72s)]
*  This is one of the things I think is really important is that we are [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6348.04s)]
*  Are able to educate people about ai and help people understand it better and better and better because um, [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6351.24s)]
*  I think it's this scary thing that [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6357.64s)]
*  Nobody understands or people feels like a boogeyman or you know feels like is is this just this like thing? [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6360.12s)]
*  That's going to take my job like that [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6366.44s)]
*  Makes it scary and I think that that affects people's you know spirituality that affects how people [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6369.16s)]
*  You know contextualize themselves with the world you could lose your purpose if your purpose is a job that you feel it's going to disappear [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6375.24s)]
*  Yeah, that could already be [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6381.32s)]
*  Causing you to feel that way [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6384.28s)]
*  Yeah, so but I think I think if you if we can explain ai more and ultimately like um [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6385.96s)]
*  Like it is it is a cool technology, but it's not that magical [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6393.08s)]
*  It's just you know, it's like data and you crunch that data and then you get these algorithms. And so it's not like [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6396.2s)]
*  um [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6402.6s)]
*  it's not uh [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6403.64s)]
*  Yeah, some people talk about in this crazy way [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6405.64s)]
*  But but I think as long as we are able to explain what ai is and also explain what opportunities it creates over time [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6408.12s)]
*  and to me it's about getting [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6414.04s)]
*  this like [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6416.04s)]
*  relationship between [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6417.06s)]
*  Humanity and ai right like how do we make sure that this is something that [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6418.6s)]
*  enables [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6423.0s)]
*  us as humans to be more human and us as humans to do more and experience more and be better and all these things versus [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6424.360000000001s)]
*  something that kind of [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6431.72s)]
*  Um is scary or will take over or anything like that. I think that's really important [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6433.0s)]
*  What's a place like so if I go to chat gbt, is that scale ai? Is that the same thing or it's different? [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6438.84s)]
*  That's it. So we so we're actually kind of under the hood powering all the different models and ai's so [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6443.72s)]
*  Are all the different ai like? [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6451.56s)]
*  Yeah, some's under the hood. Yeah. Yeah, so we help power chat gbt and open ai we help power [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6454.04s)]
*  Mostly from the data perspective so and do we know if the answer came from your company or other companies? [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6459.96s)]
*  If we ask it a question, like how do we? [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6464.599999999999s)]
*  There's probably no way to like literally tell but yeah, we help power, you know open ai's and we help power google's ai systems and [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6467.96s)]
*  Meta's ai systems and help power all the all the major ai systems [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6474.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, how can a regular person just set their home right? [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6479.879999999999s)]
*  Say there's a guy who's been listening to this today [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6482.28s)]
*  He wants to go home today and he just wants to learn a little bit of how ai works [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6483.799999999999s)]
*  He could just go on to chat gbt and ask it a couple questions. Yeah, you could ask chat gbt how ai works [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6487.24s)]
*  Um, you could ask it. What's the history of my town? You know, um, can you research my last name? [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6493.08s)]
*  Maybe in case see where it came from [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6497.48s)]
*  What are uh [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6500.36s)]
*  like [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6502.84s)]
*  Maybe what are some? [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6504.04s)]
*  Innovations that could happen in the next few years. There's different little things you can just ask it [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6506.34s)]
*  That's how you can start to have a relationship with asking and learning about [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6509.8s)]
*  Uh, and you see what it's good at what it's not good at like right now ai is still [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6513.400000000001s)]
*  Uh really bad at a lot of things like most things. This is why this is why I think when people [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6517.8s)]
*  Understand it and really get a feel for it. It stops being as scary because uh [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6523.700000000001s)]
*  because I think we think about it as like we think about like the ai from the movies that are sort of like [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6528.84s)]
*  You know all-powerful and whatnot [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6533.08s)]
*  But uh, yeah [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6534.4400000000005s)]
*  You think of it as a robot that's going to show up and just start driving your truck around or something and you're like [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6535.0s)]
*  What the fuck do I do? You know what i'm saying? [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6539.56s)]
*  My keys were in my truck, you know, I can't even get in my house now. Like I think that's the [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6542.200000000001s)]
*  There is this boogeyman fear. Yeah. Yeah, but that's not the truth. It's not the truth and like, um [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6546.92s)]
*  Yeah, that's not the truth and and it's to me [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6553.320000000001s)]
*  It's like we have we kind of the choice to make sure that also doesn't become the truth, right? [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6556.04s)]
*  like we definitely we in the like people building ai but just in general everybody in the world has like [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6561.08s)]
*  Like we should all make sure to use it as something that like an assistant as something that like helps us versus [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6567.0s)]
*  um versus think about it in like uh in like a scary way [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6574.200000000001s)]
*  Well getting to learn and learn how to use it small ways [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6577.88s)]
*  Whatever is certainly a way that you're going to start to realize what it is [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6580.76s)]
*  Yeah, and it's easy to just sit there and say it's horrible and without trying to use it to learn about it [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6584.84s)]
*  Yeah, sometimes I won't learn about something just so I can continue to say it's a boogeyman, you know [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6589.72s)]
*  Because it kind of gives me an excuse. Yeah, you know if I if I choose not to learn about it in my own life [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6593.16s)]
*  um chat gbt has become like a proprietary like like name like band-aids or [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6598.2s)]
*  um [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6605.48s)]
*  Ping pong is that okay that it's like that? Yeah, I think that's that's totally fine [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6607.32s)]
*  I mean, I think basically like we there will probably be [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6612.04s)]
*  more ai's over time that people get used to and use and [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6615.96s)]
*  Um like anything, you know, there will always be like a uh [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6619.96s)]
*  In america, there'll always be a bunch of options for consumers and much options for people to use and they'll be good at different things [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6625.240000000001s)]
*  right, so I think like um [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6630.84s)]
*  Right now we're just in the very early innings of ai, but over time we're going to have you know, just like how um [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6633.400000000001s)]
*  uh for for anything like for for clothes or for you know [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6640.68s)]
*  Energy drinks or for whatever like different people have different tastes because there's going to be different things that different ai's are good at and [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6645.72s)]
*  Other things that other ai's are bad at is ai right now smarter than humanity [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6652.84s)]
*  No [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6658.04s)]
*  um, yeah, so I think what ai is good at because it's ingested all of the [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6658.84s)]
*  The facts right like it's ingested this like the body of water is really really big and it's ingested so many different [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6666.04s)]
*  Facts and information from [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6673.72s)]
*  all of humanity it definitely like [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6676.4400000000005s)]
*  Knows more um or like, you know, just like how google knows a lot more than than any person does so it definitely [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6679.400000000001s)]
*  Knows a lot more [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6685.72s)]
*  um [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6687.240000000001s)]
*  But it's not like you know, there's there's a very very there's tons of things that humans can do that ai [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6688.200000000001s)]
*  Is just like fundamentally incapable of doing so [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6694.52s)]
*  um, so it's not a [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6697.72s)]
*  It's not like a I don't think you can even like measure one versus the other [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6699.72s)]
*  They're sort of like very different kinds of intelligence [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6703.320000000001s)]
*  Could ai just create a better ai at a certain point like could it just be like hey ai create a better ai and it could [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6706.04s)]
*  do that [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6712.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, this is a good question. Actually. This is this is another [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6714.2s)]
*  really, uh hot topic in the ai industry is [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6717.56s)]
*  Is can you get ai's to start doing some of the engineering and some of the improvement on its own? [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6721.88s)]
*  And can it scary because then it's making kind of choices then it's becoming the lifeguard. It's becoming the water and the [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6729.24s)]
*  Coast guard. Yeah, so this is something [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6737.56s)]
*  I mean my personal thought is I think this is something we should kind of watch a little bit and we should make sure that [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6739.8s)]
*  Humans always are have the sort of like steering wheel and the the sort of uh control over [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6746.28s)]
*  um, because like you're saying you know, it's a kind of a slippery slope before that gets kind of uh, [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6751.72s)]
*  You know a little a little weird but um, but I don't I think that like we can we [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6757.48s)]
*  We can maintain that we can make sure that we don't let the ai just sort of like keep iterating and improving on its own [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6762.44s)]
*  Yeah, and in the end you can always shut off your computer and phone and go for a walk, huh? [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6768.28s)]

*  one of the crazy things about [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6853.56s)]
*  tech and the tech industry is that you know, we've been we've been just sort of like building this thing up over time [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6855.8s)]
*  But one of the things that that happened is ai all of a sudden [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6861.56s)]
*  became [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6865.4800000000005s)]
*  Like there was so much progress in ai and it became [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6866.6s)]
*  The biggest thing in the world, right? Like I mean, um [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6869.4800000000005s)]
*  All of a sudden, you know anywhere I go i'm everybody is talking about ai it didn't used to be like that when I started the company [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6873.08s)]
*  um, uh ai was just kind of a like a niche topic and now it's like, you know anywhere you go [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6880.12s)]
*  Like i'll just be walking around and I hear like random conversations about for sure [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6887.56s)]
*  gbt and ai and robots and all this stuff and uh, [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6891.24s)]
*  And so it's kind of been crazy to be experience that and be a part of that [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6895.320000000001s)]
*  wave and kind of like [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6900.280000000001s)]
*  You know started working on this company almost nine years ago [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6902.4400000000005s)]
*  so it was [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6905.8s)]
*  Like when I started working on was kind of obscure thing and you know [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6907.0s)]
*  I always knew that it was going to become bigger, but I would I could have never predicted what was going to happen ai [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6910.04s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, it's fascinating. It's almost like you were just standing on like [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6914.6s)]
*  The bingo number they got called kind of yeah, exactly by time. Yeah [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6918.4400000000005s)]
*  Um, and it's surreal. Oh, I feel when that happens. Oh, yeah, I can only imagine that um [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6922.759999999999s)]
*  Are your parents pretty proud of you? What's that like? [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6929.0s)]
*  Yeah, so at first they were like, you know at first I dropped out of college, right? [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6932.2s)]
*  And in asian culture that's like not a thing you do right good. Yeah. Yeah, that is like the opposite of being asian [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6937.639999999999s)]
*  Well, well my parents both have phds [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6943.08s)]
*  Um my two brothers. I have two older brothers. They both have phds [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6945.639999999999s)]
*  Uh, like everybody in my family has they've gone through all of schooling. Yeah, they're like alex is not doing good [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6949.4800000000005s)]
*  No, that might have been spanish. But they're like, yeah alex is not doing good. Yeah [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6957.4s)]
*  So they were they were pretty worried at first and I kind of um, I told them [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6961.08s)]
*  A little bit of a white lie that I was like, oh no, i'm i'm just going i'm gonna go back [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6966.68s)]
*  You know, i'm gonna finish i'm gonna get this, uh, like tech thing out of my system and i'll go back and i'll finish school [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6970.76s)]
*  Um, obviously that hasn't happened yet. But uh, but yeah, they were worried at first now that now they're super proud [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6978.2s)]
*  yeah, they're super duper proud and I uh, [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6983.72s)]
*  Yeah, and I I owe everything to my parents, you know, yeah, they're awesome and like [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6986.6s)]
*  Seriously, they're they're buying parents are super brainy. They're uh, they're both physicists [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6990.84s)]
*  they would like teach me about physics growing up and teach me about math and uh, that's what led me uh, [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=6995.96s)]
*  Be so good at the competitions, you know, that's cool [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7001.72s)]
*  Yeah, I don't even I think [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7004.92s)]
*  Do um are your parents or your grandparents from china or no? My grandparents are from china. Yeah [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7006.92s)]
*  Did your does your family have a lot of chinese culture? [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7012.76s)]
*  so this is kind of interesting this is true for a lot of um, [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7015.88s)]
*  chinese americans is that there's kind of like [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7019.4800000000005s)]
*  there's [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7022.84s)]
*  uh chinese culture and then that's kind of almost like it's very different from [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7023.96s)]
*  the [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7029.8s)]
*  Chinese communist party and the current government [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7030.6s)]
*  Because basically one way to think about china is I mean china has been is a is a culture and a civilization that's been around for [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7033.48s)]
*  Like thousands and thousands of years, right? So it's that there's a very long-standing culture [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7041.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, but that's very different from the current communist [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7046.6s)]
*  Party in the current communist regime. Oh for sure. I think most people probably think of [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7051.32s)]
*  I mean, I don't know. It's funny. I never thought about that. I definitely think about it as different [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7055.96s)]
*  I definitely don't think if I see a chinese person, I don't think oh, that's a communist person. Yeah, exactly [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7059.24s)]
*  I mean that would be yeah, that's crazy. I think that's crazy if some people thought that I just [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7063.24s)]
*  Yeah, I think somebody has a crazy long history like damn [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7068.5199999999995s)]
*  Um, and then maybe almost like do you feel like there's some people in certain parts of china are almost like a captured people [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7072.04s)]
*  Then is it do you think that's a [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7077.4s)]
*  Yeah, I mean the the weavers that we're talking about. I mean, that's just like horrible. What's happening to them [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7079.32s)]
*  I didn't even know about that man. Thanks for putting me up on that wiger game. Yeah. Yeah [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7083.719999999999s)]
*  No, it's uh, I mean some of this stuff like I mean we don't really like [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7087.48s)]
*  first of all [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7091.24s)]
*  The world is a is a huge place and there's like all sorts of both great and bad things happening all over the place [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7092.44s)]
*  Yeah, but um, but yeah, no, I think that like [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7099.799999999999s)]
*  I think a big part of this is like we want to make sure we have we have governments that uh, [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7103.24s)]
*  That believe in democracy believe in liberty these kinds of things. Yeah [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7107.16s)]
*  With being somebody that's able to be smart and conceptualized stuff. Do you [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7112.44s)]
*  Start to get and do you have any insight? This might be the last question I have for you. Um, do you have any insight on? [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7116.6s)]
*  like the afterlife or what happens like I never really thought about it for like [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7122.92s)]
*  Talking like a real math guy about that [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7128.44s)]
*  Yeah, I think um, like what's the total like what's the sum zero game or whatever? You know, what's the yeah? Yeah [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7131.64s)]
*  yeah, I guess like the way I've always thought about it because [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7137.8s)]
*  Partially because both my parents were physicists was I I kind of always feel like people live on [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7142.36s)]
*  with their ideas and they're kind of like like what are the things that the things they put out into the world that's kind of [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7148.839999999999s)]
*  how you live on because like in in math like [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7155.719999999999s)]
*  everything you learn about is like a theorem named after a different person or uh, or sort of idea named after some [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7159.96s)]
*  They're the first mathematician or the first scientist or whatever to figure that out [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7167.16s)]
*  Like einstein lives on because bagels [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7173.0s)]
*  That was a shitty joke, but thank you [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7176.92s)]
*  Oh, yeah, because yeah because the [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7179.8s)]
*  Yeah, all e equals mc squared all that kind of stuff. Yeah, so so like I know what that kind of stuff is [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7182.360000000001s)]
*  Jesus, sorry, but it's start pretending. No, no exactly. He's m squares. That's einstein. And so so I think I always feel like people [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7187.96s)]
*  Um, yeah, you live on by your ideas and and kind of what you put out into the world [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7196.360000000001s)]
*  And that's kind of always how I've thought about it [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7201.8s)]
*  um, so you don't get some deeper thought about like [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7203.88s)]
*  Like since your brain is able to be because you have probably a unique brain, right? [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7206.92s)]
*  And more I mean, you know and everybody has a unique brain [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7210.92s)]
*  But i've just never asked somebody with your i've never asked your brain this question [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7214.76s)]
*  Yeah, do you do you get some further insight about like what you think happens when you die, you know? [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7219.08s)]
*  Well, I think that one of the things that gets talked about a lot in silicon valley, um where I live especially is uh [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7225.320000000001s)]
*  like the simulation whether it's all simulation and whether like uh [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7232.200000000001s)]
*  I don't do you watch rick and morty. I don't watch it, but i'll start [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7237.4800000000005s)]
*  There's uh, there's there's some there's some episodes where it gets into this and I think it it covers it in a in a pretty good [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7241.0s)]
*  way, but like you know, what if [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7246.92s)]
*  every load of all of humanity is just like a like a almost like a [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7249.4800000000005s)]
*  An experiment or a video game that that some other civilization is running. Yeah, that's kind of the one that uh, that fucks with [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7254.120000000001s)]
*  Particularly like people's mind and tech a lot because we're like every day all day every day. We're out there trying to make [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7262.04s)]
*  computers and make simulations and make things that are that are like more and more sophisticated and advanced and capable [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7269.700000000001s)]
*  and so kind of the mind fuck is like oh what if [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7276.4400000000005s)]
*  everything we know is is just kind of the you know, [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7279.080000000001s)]
*  Simulation from some other civilization or if we advanced it enough that we're able to make this happen and seem real [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7283.56s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. Yeah, exactly. So, you know [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7289.56s)]
*  I think I think one of the things that that um like with ai and with a bunch of other things like [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7293.320000000001s)]
*  in [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7298.200000000001s)]
*  Well, even just in the past like 30 40 years video games have gotten so much more realistic, right? [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7299.080000000001s)]
*  crazy realistic, yeah, so [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7305.4800000000005s)]
*  It was we've seen that happen like in a hundred years like [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7308.4400000000005s)]
*  Would we be able to simulate something that feels pretty realistic? I mean probably right could we be avatars? [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7312.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah for some but for some other thing. Yeah, exactly. Damn dude. I'll say this my avatar is a pervert brother [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7319.16s)]

*  I don't want to make sure that like [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7535.8s)]
*  people all around the world, especially americans aren't scared of ai because it's going to be [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7537.56s)]
*  It's going to be really cool and it's going to be amazing. But um, we need to remove the boogeyman component and uh, [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7542.6s)]
*  And thanks for helping me do that [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7549.24s)]
*  Yeah, no, man. I think I definitely feel differently about it. I feel like it's a tool that I can use right? [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7551.08s)]
*  And even I don't know how to use it. So i'm trying to figure out, you know, um, one more question [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7556.52s)]
*  How do you keep it from becoming like a like a [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7560.92s)]
*  Advertisement trap house like the internet's become like the internet's just pop-ups and ads and fucking best buy trying to like beat you over [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7563.54s)]
*  The head on some shit like how do you stop that? [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7569.96s)]
*  How do you keep that out of like you guys's waters or do you have to go there at some point to make money? [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7573.0s)]
*  Yeah, first i'm hoping that that um, we have like the ai industry as a whole avoids advertising [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7579.16s)]
*  as much as possible because um [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7586.28s)]
*  Because it's kind of it's very different like it is a tool that [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7588.92s)]
*  That people can use and people can use to start businesses or make movies or make all these like different ideas happen [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7592.36s)]
*  And I I would much rather it be a tool that doesn't get sort of um [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7598.759999999999s)]
*  Uh that doesn't become yeah like an advertising thing versus like I wanted to make sure it's a tool that helps people first and foremost [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7603.719999999999s)]
*  um, so [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7611.32s)]
*  That's that I I think this is there's kind of like a a choice here [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7612.599999999999s)]
*  And uh, and we as an ai industry just gotta I think make some of the right choices [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7616.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7620.5199999999995s)]
*  I think it would be value in staying as pure as you could if you could find a way to you know [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7621.24s)]
*  If there's other money to be made on the side it almost seems sometimes like it could be a trap, you know [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7625.16s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, and I think that's that's like, uh, you know, I I want to make sure that uh, [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7629.5599999999995s)]
*  That people don't feel like they're being used by the ai's [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7636.12s)]
*  I think that'd be a really that'd be really bad if we ended up there [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7638.28s)]
*  So we you know, and I that I don't think we need to make it like that at all [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7641.24s)]
*  Like I think we can we can make sure the ai is helping you do things is is super helpful super [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7645.160000000001s)]
*  Is like a thought partner? [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7651.240000000001s)]
*  Um is it is like an like an assistant like those are things that I think we want to make sure ai stays gang, baby [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3vIuPyQQ0&t=7652.68s)]
