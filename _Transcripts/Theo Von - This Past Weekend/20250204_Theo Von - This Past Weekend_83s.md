**Theo Von - This Past Weekend:** [February 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UildvV4wCd0)
*  I realized, okay, we're going to go after a mega predator here. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UildvV4wCd0&t=0.0s)]
*  How big are they? So it's not just Pornhub, right? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UildvV4wCd0&t=4.5s)]
*  Pornhub is owned by a parent company that all of this kind of, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UildvV4wCd0&t=7.5s)]
*  I learned over the last five years, so called MindGeek. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UildvV4wCd0&t=11.5s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UildvV4wCd0&t=14.5s)]
*  Now MindGeek has a monopoly on the global big porn industry, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UildvV4wCd0&t=15.0s)]
*  and it's dominated by one company. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UildvV4wCd0&t=19.0s)]
*  That company was called MindGeek. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UildvV4wCd0&t=22.0s)]
*  They rebranded to ILO to try to escape their reputation as peddlers of crime. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UildvV4wCd0&t=24.0s)]
*  So with a $362 million loan from a hedge fund called Colbett Capital [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UildvV4wCd0&t=29.5s)]
*  and 125 secret investors who were outed as including JP Morgan Chase and Cornell University, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UildvV4wCd0&t=35.0s)]
*  they had basically rolled up the entire global porn industry under one company. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UildvV4wCd0&t=42.0s)]
*  So they owned it, MindGeek. And who owns MindGeek? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UildvV4wCd0&t=48.0s)]
*  We discovered who was the secret majority shareholder of the company, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UildvV4wCd0&t=51.0s)]
*  and his name was Bernburg Mayer. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UildvV4wCd0&t=54.0s)]
*  Bernburg Mayer? Let's bring a picture of him up. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UildvV4wCd0&t=55.5s)]
*  They are headquartered in Canada, so they have most of their employees in Canada, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UildvV4wCd0&t=58.0s)]
*  but they have offices in, now they have an office in Texas, they have one in LA, Cyprus, Romania, London. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UildvV4wCd0&t=62.5s)]
*  MindGeek has offices everywhere? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UildvV4wCd0&t=69.0s)]
*  Everywhere. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UildvV4wCd0&t=70.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UildvV4wCd0&t=70.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UildvV4wCd0&t=71.0s)]
*  So they are a multinational corporation, huge corporation, hundreds of millions of dollars a year, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UildvV4wCd0&t=71.5s)]
*  multi-billion dollar corporation with a monopoly on the global big porn industry. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UildvV4wCd0&t=78.0s)]
