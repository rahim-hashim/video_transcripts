*  That's the kind of shit you see on the side of an oven bro. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=229.24s)]
*  That's just too much. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=231.68s)]
*  It's just too much degrees for a regular man or woman. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=234.0s)]
*  So what's going on man? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=240.4s)]
*  I miss you guys. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=243.72s)]
*  Happy to be here today with you. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=244.72s)]
*  I'm in the studio. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=247.96s)]
*  I'm in the OG studio today. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=248.96s)]
*  So I really feel some nostalgia about that. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=251.84s)]
*  A lot's been going on. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=256.8s)]
*  A lot's been happening. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=258.32s)]
*  I hope you guys are doing well. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=259.32s)]
*  I'm trying to do more solo episodes because I think it's important and I miss it. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=261.56s)]
*  I want to let you know that I miss it. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=268.40000000000003s)]
*  What's happening? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=272.24s)]
*  I haven't spoken to you guys since I went to Ireland brother in England. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=273.24s)]
*  They call it the United Kingdom but I guess it's kind of united. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=280.76s)]
*  If you're in Ireland and you're on stage and you yell out fuck England they go bonkers. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=288.28s)]
*  They will start eating the freckles off of each other. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=296.36s)]
*  So I guess it's united but it's competitive. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=300.84s)]
*  So that's what they should call it. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=303.88s)]
*  Probably the competitive kingdom. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=304.88s)]
*  I think that's very fair. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=306.12s)]
*  Even certain parts of it feel like in Ireland they're like we're the real Ireland. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=310.44s)]
*  And then if you get over to, once you get over to England, the people in Manchester [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=316.44s)]
*  they're like fuck London. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=322.8s)]
*  They're posh. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=327.56s)]
*  So there was just a lot going on. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=328.56s)]
*  There was just a lot to be associated with. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=330.56s)]
*  But I want to say thank you to all the people that came out over there. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=333.2s)]
*  It's important that I address that. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=336.6s)]
*  Sometimes I feel like I leave a place and there's not a way to say thank you. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=339.76000000000005s)]
*  You know I'll go do a show somewhere and I'll leave and a lot of times I'll be sitting [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=346.96000000000004s)]
*  in the tour bus or the car or something and I'll just be like man I wish, how do I thank [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=350.96000000000004s)]
*  all these people? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=356.52000000000004s)]
*  And I'll share something on my social story or share a thank you. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=359.0s)]
*  I'm like man I just wish there was a way to thank people better sometimes. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=365.28s)]
*  And Ireland was something else man. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=371.52s)]
*  Godspeed to those drunken crooners bro. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=375.08s)]
*  Those people, they'll drink their buddy. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=378.48s)]
*  Dude I saw a guy put a straw in his friend and fucking drink him. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=381.2s)]
*  Right there. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=385.6s)]
*  All I damn. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=386.6s)]
*  Wow. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=388.6s)]
*  And he was lukewarm. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=389.6s)]
*  At least get him on ice or something or put a lime wedge on his shoulder. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=390.76000000000005s)]
*  It's just the way that they're doing it over there. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=397.36s)]
*  It's mostly men. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=400.36s)]
*  I want to say that in Ireland and they're going to disagree and that's fine. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=401.6s)]
*  But it's mostly men over there. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=406.36s)]
*  I've never seen so many men in my life. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=407.48s)]
*  Wonderful men. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=409.6s)]
*  You know beautiful, semi-beautiful, off beautiful and not even beautiful men as well. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=410.6s)]
*  Totally white. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=420.0s)]

*  Like in a circus tent it was outdoors blue and yellow. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=943.72s)]
*  It's blue and yellow and there's a couple it just and I was like who is going to show [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=948.2s)]
*  up to this circus tent and some freaking dogs showed up. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=952.72s)]
*  So that was crazy that show was kind of tough just but it was great man. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=962.24s)]
*  It's just been you know yeah hope I don't sound like I'm complaining. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=968.56s)]

*  I think that's how I feel yeah sometimes it just all happens so fast and you just want [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=985.4799999999999s)]
*  to hold on to it more. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=989.1199999999999s)]
*  But yeah we got to go see a dairy farmer right when we got over to Cork. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=993.52s)]
*  The driver our driver his cousin or nephew was working at a dairy farm so we went out [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=997.4399999999999s)]
*  there and that was pretty cool. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1004.64s)]

*  But the truth is I don't know much about them. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1038.9s)]
*  A lot of cows when I look at them they look like they kind of remind me of blind people [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1042.84s)]
*  a little bit. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1048.68s)]

*  You know because we used to be British or whatever. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1193.44s)]

*  We went to Manchester and one of the best shows some amazing shows in London were playing [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1247.3s)]
*  during the soccer match. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1255.58s)]
*  What was going on. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1259.74s)]
*  We had a mere K on tour with us. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1260.86s)]
*  Shane Todd was there. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1263.34s)]
*  If you haven't gotten to check him out man he's just such a joy to be around. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1265.98s)]
*  Jimmy Carr showed up and did a guest set in London along with Catherine Ryan. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1270.54s)]
*  And so that was really cool. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1279.18s)]
*  You know just that kindness of them to say hey I'd love to come and and be on the show [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1280.82s)]
*  and that meant a lot to me. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1288.38s)]
*  You know I felt really really welcome there and it was also a time when the soccer was [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1290.6200000000001s)]
*  kicking off in the UK. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1294.86s)]
*  So people in England were hyped bro. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1298.1399999999999s)]
*  Harry Kane. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1300.9399999999998s)]
*  Harry Kane. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1302.78s)]
*  People kept yelling Harry Kane at me and I thought my penis was hanging out. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1304.78s)]
*  I'm like oh shit I'll wax it. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1308.34s)]
*  You know but yeah I just want to say thank you to everybody that came out over there. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1311.26s)]
*  It's just such a crazy experience to go to another country and people come out to the [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1316.3799999999999s)]
*  show you know. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1320.3799999999999s)]
*  And then you're worried that like people don't like they don't know what you're talking about [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1322.18s)]
*  or that you have to change your references or whatever. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1325.94s)]
*  But that's not that you know some of that's all in my head. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1328.5400000000002s)]
*  So I think like in the first shows of in Ireland I was like worried like there's this exchange [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1331.6200000000001s)]
*  rate or whatever. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1337.66s)]
*  But it's not necessarily the case. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1340.6200000000001s)]
*  So yeah so that's what it was like over there. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1342.38s)]
*  I'm trying to think of anything else kind of wonderful that happened I mean. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1348.22s)]
*  It was just fast. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1353.02s)]
*  You know it was it just all it just happens at the speed of life. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1354.8200000000002s)]
*  And sometimes it's it feels quicker than we wish. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1359.94s)]
*  You know it feels quicker than we wish. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1364.98s)]
*  Sometimes I feel like life wants to just like minutes are just faster than they used to be. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1368.46s)]
*  Like even minutes they want to get done with it. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1376.26s)]
*  They're like let's get done with it. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1378.38s)]
*  They're like I'm just a minute I'm just going to hurry. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1380.8200000000002s)]

*  whoever they are. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1561.88s)]

*  It's almost like you convince a puppet that they're real for so long and suddenly they [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1581.3799999999999s)]
*  fuck they believe it. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1587.1s)]

*  I think we need more parties we need more possibilities. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1612.3000000000002s)]
*  I think we I think the CIA CIA and the FBI are corrupt. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1615.1000000000001s)]
*  I believe that we are living in a very corrupt experience with our government. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1619.42s)]
*  That's really what I believe. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1627.5800000000002s)]
*  And I don't believe that on the individual. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1629.8600000000001s)]
*  I don't think that the individuals are. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1631.6599999999999s)]
*  I want to say that. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1634.1399999999999s)]
*  You know but I think that the powers that are pushing them are because I don't believe [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1637.62s)]
*  that on an individual level. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1645.3799999999999s)]
*  Anyway sorry that's a lot of politics from me but I just I'm so excited now. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1649.4199999999998s)]
*  I'm so because imagine you like build a character on an on an NBA 2K or something right or 7K [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1657.3799999999999s)]
*  or whatever it is now. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1663.34s)]
*  And then finally you log in one time you want to use your character whatever and your character [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1664.6599999999999s)]
*  just fucking looks at the screen and gives you those Nate Diaz number ones baby in middle [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1668.94s)]
*  fangies and then he just does his own shit on the game and you just have to watch. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1674.1s)]
*  So that's what I'm told. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1681.82s)]
*  I am hyped about this about Biden just because it's all that's what you get. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1682.8999999999999s)]
*  That's what you get for telling a puppet that it's real the whole time. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1691.86s)]
*  Anyway so not to get super political but those are just some of my thoughts. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1696.7s)]
*  I'm always about the underdog. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1704.1s)]
*  You know that a lot of times I'm about the underdog and I felt like they were missed. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1705.58s)]
*  They were what they were doing to Joe Biden. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1710.22s)]
*  Whatever you think about him politically what they're doing to him I thought was fucked [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1714.98s)]
*  up. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1717.6200000000001s)]
*  You know if I sat in a room with a senior citizen and I knew something was not well [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1719.06s)]
*  about him and I said things to him or made him believe things to take advantage of him. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1723.96s)]
*  That's a sick person that would do that. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1732.38s)]
*  You know that's if that happened to my father I've said this before somebody did that to [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1736.46s)]
*  my father I would fucking take their legs off their body and hide them in their cousin's [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1740.78s)]
*  ass dude. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1745.7s)]
*  That's who I am. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1746.7s)]
*  You know there's just nothing sicker to me than that. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1749.8600000000001s)]
*  It's like there's people that call old people and try to sell them gold and cheat them out [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1752.44s)]
*  of their money. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1757.06s)]
*  All that shit or the those Nigerian scammer people I know that they're just trying to [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1758.78s)]
*  money in their country but just taking advantage of senior citizens just fucking that shit [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1763.78s)]
*  fucking makes me angry bro. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1769.62s)]
*  I'm sorry to use a lot of profanity today. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1771.34s)]
*  What else is going on? [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1777.34s)]
*  Sorry if this is all over the place but you know I've never known what this show is and [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1779.54s)]
*  so this is what it is. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1784.3799999999999s)]
*  I went to a WNBA game. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1786.7s)]
*  I'll say it dude. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1789.7s)]
*  A lot of guys are afraid to say it you know. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1791.46s)]
*  You know and I will say that I promised my father on his deathbed that I would not go [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1794.74s)]
*  to a WNBA game. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1799.7s)]
*  That was like his one promise or whatever. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1801.94s)]
*  And and I you know and I felt of course I won't go. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1806.06s)]
*  And he goes oh your mother if your mother found out you went to a WNBA game she'd roll [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1812.78s)]
*  over in her grave. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1817.9s)]
*  And I said I remember being like well mom's not dead yet. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1820.54s)]
*  And he's like she's dead on the inside. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1824.7s)]
*  That's what he said. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1826.8999999999999s)]
*  I was like whoa that that's crazy. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1827.8999999999999s)]
*  I mean maybe but that's crazy. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1830.74s)]
*  But no I love you mom. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1834.42s)]
*  But but I went to a game man. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1836.26s)]
*  I went to a game this past weekend in Las Vegas. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1839.34s)]
*  I'm a Kate Martin fan. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1843.3s)]
*  I'm not going to sit in the closet anymore. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1845.98s)]
*  I am a Kate Martin fan. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1849.46s)]
*  I became an Iowa Hawkeyes female basketball fan. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1852.42s)]
*  I did. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1856.54s)]
*  And a lot you know for some people it's almost like admitting that they're using drugs or [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1858.7s)]
*  whatever. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1863.82s)]
*  For me it's not like that. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1864.82s)]
*  I became an Iowa Hawkeyes fan. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1866.98s)]
*  Female hoops. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1871.22s)]
*  I mean they put up way more points in the Iowa men's football team. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1873.02s)]
*  So right there if you even want to see a point scored you got to watch them. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1879.42s)]
*  If you're even anywhere near Iowa City. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1884.5s)]
*  So but yes I went to a Kate Martin game and I got to see her play dude and I was fucking [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1886.3400000000001s)]
*  excited man. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1891.98s)]
*  I'm not going to and I'll say this. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1892.98s)]
*  This is the best thing. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1894.76s)]
*  The best thing that I didn't realize is some of the player you know as a guy you're sitting [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1901.22s)]
*  there you're watching the game and first of all it's super relatable and I'll tell you [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1907.6599999999999s)]
*  why because a lot of times you'll see the women driving to the hoop and they can't dunk [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1912.26s)]
*  right. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1917.26s)]
*  They can't dunk and that's fine. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1918.26s)]
*  But it's to me it's the most relatable thing I've ever seen. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1921.94s)]
*  I can't dunk you know at this point in my life I can't dunk. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1926.18s)]
*  So if I'm going to the hoop and I got a layup it's there's nothing more relatable to a white [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1931.98s)]
*  guy than driving to the hoop and you can't dunk. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1937.18s)]
*  So at that moment I like holy shit this is the most relatable moment of my whole life. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1941.78s)]
*  I can't really relate to all those bangers that are out there in the NBA all those Viancé [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1948.22s)]
*  Carter's baby them Vince Carters. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1955.14s)]
*  I can't you know I can admire it but I can relate to it. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1958.26s)]
*  But when you see somebody coasting through the lane or trying to figure it out catching [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1965.94s)]
*  a bounce pass and they're going up and the only thing they can do is layup. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1970.48s)]
*  Bruh as a white off white semi-Nicaraguan guy I can relate a thousand percent. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1976.8600000000001s)]
*  So that's one thing that I realized it was so relatable about the games man. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1988.8200000000002s)]
*  The second thing that I thought was really fascinating is as a man some of the players [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=1995.1s)]
*  you're attracted to them. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=2000.3s)]
*  You know you're watching the players and a lot of their women. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=2002.58s)]
*  So if you use a man that likes a woman then you know. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=2007.32s)]
*  So it's weird so it's like you know at the men's game that never happens I'm just kind [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=2015.8999999999999s)]
*  of marveling at the athleticism. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=2020.26s)]
*  I'm hoping that none of the players are trying to bang my girl or whatever. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=2022.86s)]
*  Just usual shit but as at the WNBA game you're like damn shorty shorty shorty. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=2027.86s)]
*  The shorty wanna come in. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=2037.58s)]
*  You know you just it's different. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=2041.5s)]
*  So I realized that I thought that was interesting just to have this element of like oh I'm attracted [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=2044.46s)]
*  to some of these gals bruh. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=2052.06s)]
*  And some guys you're like I will never be attracted. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=2055.2599999999998s)]
*  Bruh go to the games dude. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=2057.86s)]
*  Go to the games bruh. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=2061.38s)]
*  See if some of these beautiful broads don't hit a three pointer and your butt starts sweating [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=2063.98s)]
*  a little. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=2069.18s)]
*  Alright live your life. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=2071.2999999999997s)]
*  So yeah so just been praying about a lot of that kind of stuff man. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=2081.18s)]
*  But that was so those were some things about the WNBA game that I really loved. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=2085.74s)]
*  And I know it sounds crazy to say that I'm sorry dad. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=2091.58s)]
*  I'm sorry dad. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=2095.2999999999997s)]
*  But Asia Wilson broke the franchise record. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=2100.58s)]
*  I didn't know there was a franchise but it doesn't matter. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=2104.3799999999997s)]
*  She broke the franchise record. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=2106.74s)]
*  And this is one of the best things that the WNBA has going for it as well. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=2108.14s)]
*  I think this is my opinion. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=2112.9s)]
*  My opinion means nothing. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=2114.46s)]
*  Means nothing. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=2116.62s)]
*  You could feed it to a fucking baby. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=2117.62s)]
*  You could feed it to a bee Sean. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=2119.18s)]
*  But the fact that the best team in the league right now is in Las Vegas. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=2122.46s)]
*  So you have so many people that are just in Las Vegas that are there you know touristing. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=2129.18s)]
*  So if they go see a team bro they're going to see the best team. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=2134.1s)]
*  So I'm not sure if that's by design. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=2138.7s)]

*  And so that for a long time, anytime I had a feeling or anything, you know, I [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=3232.5s)]
*  would watch pornography or something where I would masturbate or do something [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=3236.66s)]
*  like that, because I just didn't know how to handle any of my feelings, [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=3240.3s)]
*  especially if it was a feeling about like, um, maybe dating or intimacy [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=3243.7400000000002s)]

*  time, like it got better, but it still was always this thing, like, or if I [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=3265.14s)]
*  felt uncomfortable in that, you know, I would resort to that, um, cause it [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=3270.58s)]
*  would make me feel something. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=3275.18s)]
*  It would make me feel some connection, even if it wasn't real. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=3276.38s)]
*  Um, so yeah, I'm just, I haven't had this kind of a time in my life where I've [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=3280.8199999999997s)]

*  us in the living room and we were watching, um, the movie water boy. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=3668.8199999999997s)]
*  Whoa, whoa. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=3673.62s)]
*  If somebody touches your freaking junk to water boy. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=3674.74s)]
*  Let's hear more. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=3681.62s)]
*  And we started like making out and kissing and I was wearing these like dark jeans and he started [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=3683.22s)]
*  to like put his hand down there and started like, you know, rubbing the area, but [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=3690.66s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=3695.14s)]
*  He's a pervert. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=3695.8599999999997s)]
*  Obviously, you know, we're 15. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=3698.3399999999997s)]
*  We don't know what we're doing. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=3700.2599999999998s)]
*  He's like kind of, you know, being a little aggressive with a little hard. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=3701.7s)]
*  Well, my mom came in from inside and so we like panicked and like jumped up and then [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=3705.7799999999997s)]
*  we looked at his hand and his hand was dyed blue. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=3711.94s)]
*  Like his fingers were dyed blue from rubbing my jeans so hard. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=3716.1s)]
*  And then this is kind of awkward because we were only 15, so we couldn't drive home. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=3720.18s)]
*  So then my mom had to drive him home. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=3724.5s)]
*  So I was a little awkward, but after that, you know, that was the first time. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=3727.7799999999997s)]
*  So after that, we got kind of into it and he ended up riding his bike through a blizzard [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=3731.54s)]
*  for a few miles, uh, to come do it. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=3738.2599999999998s)]
*  Wow. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=3741.7s)]

*  I, that's the kind of shit that I'm like, why? [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=3747.54s)]
*  But you know, we've all done things to ejaculate or to, um, I don't know what women do, [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=3756.66s)]
*  but to, or, you know, to pretend we're ejaculating. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=3761.7s)]

*  And the worst part about that story is that it turned me on a little bit. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4043.06s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4050.42s)]

*  there was a time in my life where I would put chocolate on women's back, you know, [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4061.94s)]
*  and call them chocolate backs or whatever. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4065.14s)]
*  And that shit wouldn't, you know, make me, would, you know, turn me on and make me want [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4067.3799999999997s)]
*  to just fucking just really just rattle inside of them, inside of those women. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4072.98s)]

*  If he's, if he said, if you were a slave, I would buy you. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4088.1s)]
*  But then what would he do? [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4094.18s)]
*  Would he set you free? [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4095.22s)]
*  I think that would be my question. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4096.42s)]
*  Cause if not, this guy is a sex trafficker, you know? [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4100.18s)]
*  So that's where I'm at. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4105.46s)]
*  I would find out the next chapter of this book, you know, how many years of slavery, [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4106.58s)]
*  you know, that's what I would find out because that's some, that's some wild shit. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4112.34s)]
*  But then I, you know, I think there's some people that don't care. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4117.7s)]
*  You know, a lot of some of that stuff, it just, it's so far in the past. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4120.099999999999s)]
*  Some people were able to just look past it and they think that it's, it can be okay. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4123.22s)]
*  It can be a Halloween costume or whatever. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4127.06s)]
*  We had a Halloween costume one time. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4129.38s)]
*  It was a mixed couple that showed up to our door and they were like in like a slave and [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4133.06s)]

*  You touched his wiener. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4245.94s)]
*  If I go to a zoo or something and somebody's standing there looking at the [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4247.299999999999s)]

*  That guy, he's enjoying animals and eating, uh, carbs or whatever. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4257.62s)]
*  I'm the we, I'm touching the guys. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4262.74s)]
*  If you carry somebody in, let's hear more. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4264.82s)]
*  This is confusing. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4266.74s)]
*  My uncle who's, who's handicapped and, uh, he's in a wheelchair and I had to carry him in [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4267.62s)]

*  And I touched his wiener a little bit and I was just, I'm trying to, I'm trying to wrap [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4279.139999999999s)]
*  my head around the fact, you know, you know, that we make contact. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4283.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4288.179999999999s)]
*  Look, I now understand a little better. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4288.42s)]
*  So you, who's carrying him in, he touched his wiener a little. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4290.0199999999995s)]
*  Now I'll say that if you carry him back out and touches wiener and he keeps saying, [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4292.26s)]
*  Hey, carry me in, carry me out, carry me in, carry me out, carry me in, carry me out. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4295.54s)]
*  And then you got to change his, change his pants or whatever. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4299.3s)]
*  Then that's, that shit seems illegal to me, dude. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4303.22s)]
*  Then you guys are gay, I think. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4307.780000000001s)]
*  So yeah, I think if it's, but if once a day you carry him from here to there, [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4310.02s)]
*  whatever, and touches wiener a little bit or just mile, you know, [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4313.3s)]
*  keeping fired up or whatever about the next day or whatever, I think that's fine. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4317.38s)]
*  But if you're carting them all over until he EJACs or whatever, then you, [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4321.700000000001s)]
*  for me, you are a, oh, you're a bad guy. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4326.900000000001s)]
*  And that's what I'll tell you, brother. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4331.62s)]
*  And I'm not judging you because I don't know you, but [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4332.9800000000005s)]
*  you've been touching that guy's wiener and he's handicapped. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4336.820000000001s)]
*  That's the scariest thing about touching a handicapped guy's wieners. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4344.18s)]
*  They can't stop you. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4346.5s)]
*  So if you want, you can do unlimited touches on it. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4347.38s)]
*  And that's where the devil lives, brother. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4355.14s)]

*  Onward. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4386.9s)]
*  I worked for a machine shop, but I took some advice that you gave [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4389.62s)]
*  when you had Dave Ramsey on. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4395.46s)]
*  You had suggested ways of making extra money. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4397.62s)]
*  So I went and bought a pressure washer and just, [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4401.78s)]
*  it's expensive as things are now. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4406.1s)]
*  I got a family. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4408.66s)]
*  I've got three kids and they're not cheap. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4409.46s)]
*  So I just needed an extra way to make some money. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4412.66s)]
*  So I took your advice and, man, I'm cleaning up. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4417.06s)]
*  Like I'm getting one or two jobs a weekend now. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4423.22s)]
*  So I just wanted to call in and say thanks for the advice. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4429.14s)]
*  And I appreciate everything you do. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4432.66s)]
*  Hey, man. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4436.98s)]

*  I'm going to hire you for a job somewhere. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4445.62s)]
*  I'm sure I got a friend down there who could use some pressure washing. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4447.62s)]
*  So I'm going to put another job on your calendar over there, my boy. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4450.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I appreciate it. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4456.0199999999995s)]
*  Look, man, thanks for trying it out. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4456.82s)]
*  I think it's something. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4458.82s)]
*  It's like, you know, it's that next step of how do I become my own boss? [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4459.78s)]
*  How do I work for me? [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4466.259999999999s)]
*  You know, how am I in control of what I do? [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4468.099999999999s)]
*  And the pressure wash is just the most simple little thing. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4470.0199999999995s)]
*  But people don't want to go out and deal with it. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4472.98s)]
*  You know, I remember when I first moved to Los Angeles, I put up flyers. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4475.7s)]
*  I said, I'll come clean your refrigerator. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4479.0599999999995s)]
*  Clean your refrigerator. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4481.78s)]
*  People, people don't want to clean their refrigerators. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4482.82s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4487.62s)]
*  You think about you clean your whole house, but that bitch is fucking weird in there. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4488.02s)]
*  And there's some weird things on the wall or some damn mustard here. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4491.620000000001s)]
*  Something sweated on the fucking glass or plastic in there. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4494.900000000001s)]
*  You know, I remember doing that, man. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4499.860000000001s)]
*  Putting up flyers, I fucking get called. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4503.780000000001s)]
*  People come clean my fridge. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4505.9400000000005s)]
*  So I went over to her house and she kept showing me her damn produce drawer. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4507.620000000001s)]

*  She was showing that. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4513.540000000001s)]
*  Yeah, right over there off of Barrington, brother out in Los Angeles. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4514.9s)]
*  But amen, brother. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4520.9s)]
*  Thank you for trying. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4524.42s)]

*  But I appreciate that, man. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4534.74s)]
*  And congrats for you. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4536.34s)]
*  Just it's a little things where you start to take control of your own life. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4537.46s)]
*  Or just trying to like, okay, well, how do I be a boss of myself? [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4541.0599999999995s)]

*  Talking about my first time someone touched my genitalia. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4809.24s)]
*  This is back in high school. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4813.32s)]
*  I was at a party, you know, we drinking. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4814.84s)]
*  And this is the first time I'm kind of drinking too. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4817.32s)]
*  So I obviously have a lot of friends that are like, Oh, I'm going to be a [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4819.32s)]
*  drinker too. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4822.52s)]

*  Oh, you don't know the consequences of what drinking does to your genitalia. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4828.4400000000005s)]
*  Understood onward. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4831.400000000001s)]
*  See this pretty girl and I straight up a conversation and one thing leads to another [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4832.360000000001s)]
*  and we're in the bathroom. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4836.68s)]
*  But my little Peter decides not to work and I'm embarrassed. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4838.200000000001s)]
*  I'm like, ah, this never happens. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4842.52s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4845.4800000000005s)]

*  It never happened ever before. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4850.120000000001s)]
*  She's like, Oh, it's okay. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4851.959999999999s)]
*  It's okay. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4853.24s)]
*  We get out. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4854.839999999999s)]
*  Everything's fine. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4855.4s)]
*  Go to school the next day. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4856.759999999999s)]
*  My new nickname, baby dick. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4859.08s)]
*  And that situation kind of sucked, but we're past it now. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4862.36s)]
*  Yeah, we're past it, but you just told everybody about it. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4867.959999999999s)]
*  But yeah, that's tough, dude. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4871.32s)]
*  I remember when I was a kid, if a girl even tried to touch my wiener, I would just say, [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4874.5199999999995s)]
*  my wiener is super long. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4878.12s)]
*  I just kept, I would repeat that over and over again, almost to try to trick them. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4879.32s)]
*  Like my wiener super long, my wiener super long, my wiener super long, my wiener super long. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4882.2s)]
*  And they would touch it. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4887.4s)]
*  I think they didn't even fucking, they're like, one girl, I remember her pulling it. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4889.24s)]
*  Like, is there more of it? [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4893.16s)]
*  It just doesn't seem like there's that much more of it. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4894.28s)]
*  And so I think, yeah, there's a little bit of reverse psychology there when it comes [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4897.5599999999995s)]
*  to somebody touching your wiener, you know, but it is what it is, man. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4902.759999999999s)]
*  But thank you for sharing that with us, dude. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4907.8s)]

*  Everybody that's come out everywhere. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4929.16s)]
*  I think one of the disappointing parts about not doing a lot of solo episodes is not being able [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4930.28s)]
*  to thank everybody for the different shows and different weekends. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4933.8s)]
*  And man, I even did a show in New Orleans and I don't even know when I was on stage [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4937.88s)]

*  You know, some of it's nothing purposeful. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4946.68s)]
*  You just get, you're just going. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4948.360000000001s)]
*  I mean, you know, sometimes you just don't know what's going on. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4952.28s)]
*  You're just trying to keep your head above your shoulders, you know. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4954.92s)]
*  But I just want to say thank you guys. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4961.16s)]
*  For bearing with me and I'm trying to focus the second half of this year. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4963.8s)]
*  I want to start some type of a foundation or something and start to create ways to give back [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4971.320000000001s)]
*  to people or groups or something. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4976.2s)]
*  I don't know what it is yet. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4978.68s)]
*  And I know we've talked about it for a while, but I just feel it on my heart all the time. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4979.8s)]
*  You know, and I know we all feel that I have so many people to reach out and like, [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4986.2s)]
*  I just want to help people. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4989.400000000001s)]
*  I just want to, you know. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4990.2s)]
*  And so, yeah, I don't know how to start putting that together, what it is. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4992.12s)]
*  And some of it I think I'm just going to pray about, you know, and see what God shares with me. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=4996.599999999999s)]
*  But yeah, just thank you guys for just giving me. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5006.36s)]
*  Just a lot, just something to do. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5012.599999999999s)]
*  You know, thank you for being a part of my life and [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5016.839999999999s)]
*  let me be a part of yours. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5020.44s)]
*  I mean that. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5021.72s)]
*  Hi, Theo. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5024.76s)]
*  It's David from Indiana. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5026.28s)]
*  What's up, David? [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5029.4s)]
*  Nice to hear you call, brother. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5030.2s)]
*  Young fellow here, obviously it sounds like, or a man with a very young vocal [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5031.56s)]
*  box onward. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5037.96s)]
*  My whole family is a big fan of you. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5040.36s)]
*  They listen to you all the time. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5043.16s)]
*  I am personally, I think I'm a fan of you. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5045.8s)]
*  I am personally, I think you're one of the funniest guys on the planet. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5048.76s)]
*  And just keep doing what you do, man. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5053.48s)]
*  God bless. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5056.28s)]
*  And don't ever let anyone bring you down. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5057.48s)]
*  Okay. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5063.4s)]
*  Bye bye, Theo. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5064.92s)]
*  I love you. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5065.8s)]
*  Gang, man. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5067.5599999999995s)]
*  I appreciate that. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5068.28s)]
*  You know, [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5075.8s)]
*  it's kind of funny. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5078.36s)]
*  It's almost like it's like a kid, like me calling from the past or something. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5079.0s)]
*  You know, I wonder if that, I mean, I believe that's a real person and obviously it's not [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5087.08s)]
*  me calling from the past, but I think it's interesting how voices come in to your life or, [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5090.76s)]
*  and it could as well just as well be you calling from the past. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5098.28s)]
*  Imagine if little you could call from the past and say, hey man, [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5101.8s)]
*  we love you and don't let anything bring you down. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5105.4800000000005s)]
*  Man, how cool would that be? [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5109.320000000001s)]
*  And maybe sometimes even as humans, as adults, we can sit there and we can take that call, [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5116.84s)]
*  you know, [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5120.84s)]
*  if I were to just sit there and kind of lay by myself in my bed or something, [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5125.0s)]
*  it may sound crazy to some people and that's fine or sit by myself in my car and [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5128.360000000001s)]
*  just almost visualize, you know, that it's a young me calling. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5132.28s)]
*  Let me play it again for myself here. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5138.76s)]
*  Okay, let's not, let's not play his name because that makes it not me, [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5144.360000000001s)]
*  but let's play the rest of it. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5147.400000000001s)]
*  Just a little thought. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5161.8s)]
*  It's just kind of funny, you know, if I could sit there and think if a young me called, man, [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5173.64s)]
*  what would he say to the future? [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5177.4800000000005s)]
*  You know, what would he really say? [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5179.24s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5182.12s)]
*  All right, let's take one more call that came in, man. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5184.2s)]
*  Ron of Virginia, Tommy boy. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5192.28s)]
*  What's going on? [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5195.08s)]
*  Cat daddy. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5196.12s)]
*  I just want to tell you, bro, you, you came back here this past October and killed it, man. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5198.6s)]
*  I had a really good time at your show, man. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5204.84s)]
*  I had a blast, dude. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5207.8s)]
*  And I rock that rat king t-shirt everywhere I go. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5208.84s)]
*  People always ask me about it. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5213.400000000001s)]
*  I tell them, look you up, man. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5214.68s)]
*  Thank you, dude. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5217.400000000001s)]
*  I appreciate that, man. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5218.04s)]
*  My brother has a rat king t-shirt that he wears sometimes and it's like, [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5219.08s)]
*  it makes my day when he wears it, you know. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5224.84s)]
*  You know, I know he wears it because he's proud of me, but it just, I don't know. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5229.88s)]
*  There's just something about it makes me feel good. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5232.44s)]
*  Anyway, that feels seemed a little bit weird, but thank you, dude, for, for sharing. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5236.2s)]
*  Thanks for coming out to Roanoke, dude. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5240.92s)]
*  I felt like that was a tough show, kind of, to be honest with you, [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5242.36s)]
*  but I appreciate you coming out onward. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5245.24s)]
*  Uh, I just want to show you support, man. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5247.4s)]
*  I just hit a, uh, uh, alcoholics anonymous. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5250.04s)]
*  Uh, I got a month chip today. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5255.48s)]
*  It's not the first time, but I did do that today. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5257.88s)]
*  So I'm feeling pretty good about it, man. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5261.8s)]
*  And I just wanted to share with another person in recovery and someone who understands [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5263.639999999999s)]
*  because I'm a little lonely out here, bud. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5269.32s)]
*  Um, yeah, tell me why. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5272.599999999999s)]
*  That's awesome, dude. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5275.719999999999s)]
*  I know we had another call a minute ago about it, but that's awesome, man. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5278.12s)]
*  There's just something about it, bro. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5281.5599999999995s)]
*  There's something about it. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5284.2s)]
*  And thank you so much for calling and sharing that with me, man. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5285.24s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5287.4s)]
*  It took me a while to get to this call. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5287.799999999999s)]
*  Um, but yeah, man, there's just something about it. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5289.24s)]
*  30 days off at anything, bro. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5293.5599999999995s)]
*  30 days off, looking at your hands, see if you could do that. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5295.48s)]
*  People can't do 30 days off anything. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5298.12s)]
*  So to do 30 days off of something, man, it's just so powerful. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5301.48s)]
*  And it's because it's you saying, Hey, I, I want to have a say in how I behave. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5304.52s)]
*  You know, and there's no judgment against people that don't do it. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5312.120000000001s)]
*  It's just because some people don't need to do it. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5314.52s)]
*  They're fine. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5316.52s)]
*  They're made and fine, but fucking guys like us, Tommy, are the girls will be here soon. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5316.92s)]
*  You know what I'm saying, brother? [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5323.64s)]
*  That girls are never coming. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5325.160000000001s)]
*  Tommy. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5327.160000000001s)]
*  Oh man, dude, I'm so happy for you. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5329.0s)]
*  Dude, I'm so happy for you. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5332.04s)]
*  I really am just like, it makes me, it's, it feels like my heart just comes to the top [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5334.84s)]
*  of my fucking body and smiles or something, you know, uh, onward. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5341.24s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5348.28s)]
*  I hope you're doing well, man. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5349.08s)]
*  Uh, you know, we all got problems, but I think, uh, our problems are a little more [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5350.5199999999995s)]
*  manageable when we're not drinking and when we're not, uh, trying to suppress our feelings [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5357.24s)]
*  and we can clearly think about it. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5362.44s)]
*  But listen to that. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5364.2s)]
*  You hear that? [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5365.4s)]
*  You hear what that is right there, guys? [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5365.96s)]
*  That's a young man who's has a little bit of clarity and he's able to see his, [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5367.799999999999s)]
*  his life a little bit more as when you're like viewing something, like looking out of a window [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5373.88s)]
*  as opposed to viewing it where you are, um, looking out of a drain. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5382.68s)]
*  Um, and I'm not judging, I don't know what your life was like before Tommy, [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5392.12s)]
*  but I just think it's like for all of us, you know, [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5394.84s)]
*  you're not looking from the complete bottom up anymore. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5398.92s)]
*  You're looking out of a window or, you know, a third story window or just something, [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5403.0s)]
*  get a little bit of a view and you can realize that everything's okay. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5406.68s)]
*  That you have a chance, man. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5410.92s)]
*  I love you, bro. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5413.4s)]
*  I appreciate you making that call. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5414.36s)]
*  Just filling us in, dude, because it's moments like this, man, that, um, [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5416.92s)]
*  make other people think that they can keep going and me too. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5422.76s)]
*  You know, it makes us all think that we can keep going, you know, um, [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5426.84s)]
*  because I believe that God picked us to live out here on this, in this life. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5432.84s)]
*  And I think that that means something. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3epIccA_4DU&t=5436.92s)]
