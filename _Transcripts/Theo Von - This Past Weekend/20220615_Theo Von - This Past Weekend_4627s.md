*  Do you think you might have a... [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=151.6s)]
*  Because I guess you're from kind of a desert area, is that right? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=152.6s)]
*  No, not at all. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=154.6s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=155.6s)]
*  From like the sprawling metropolis of North Houston. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=156.6s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=158.6s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=159.6s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=160.6s)]
*  I mean, I grew up, you know, out in the country, but very, very close to a lot of shit. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=161.6s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=166.6s)]
*  Very humid, very hot. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=167.6s)]
*  Is it? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=168.6s)]
*  I think I'm just immune to it. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=169.6s)]
*  Dang, yeah, you might be, man. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=170.6s)]
*  Built up an immunity. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=171.6s)]
*  Because you grew up out in... [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=172.6s)]
*  I know you're in Texas, and is that West Texas considered? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=175.6s)]
*  No, no. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=178.6s)]
*  I grew up in Southeast Texas, just north of Houston. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=179.6s)]
*  And then I lived in Austin. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=181.6s)]
*  Ten days after I graduated high school, I moved to Austin, and I was like, I'm going [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=182.6s)]
*  to be a fucking country singer. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=186.6s)]
*  Really? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=188.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=189.6s)]
*  Sorry, man. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=190.6s)]
*  I got in late last night. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=191.6s)]
*  That's good, though. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=192.6s)]
*  Did you have a good time? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=193.6s)]
*  No, man. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=194.6s)]
*  I did not. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=195.6s)]
*  I had a... [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=196.6s)]
*  Well, I mean, I don't know if I did or not. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=197.6s)]
*  Parker McCallum, ladies and gentlemen. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=200.6s)]
*  Thanks for being here, man. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=202.6s)]
*  Man, thanks for having me. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=204.6s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=205.6s)]
*  Yeah, it's nice to get to meet you. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=206.6s)]
*  Yeah, we had to go do an intervention on a family member yesterday, so it was like, damn, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=208.6s)]
*  you know? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=214.6s)]
*  You know Shane Gillis is? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=215.6s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=216.6s)]
*  Have you seen his live in Austin stand up? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=217.6s)]
*  Is that his special? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=220.6s)]
*  Yeah, where he talks about taking his sister that was doing heroin to her intervention, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=221.6s)]
*  they took her to Six Flags. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=224.6s)]
*  I haven't seen that part. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=225.6s)]
*  That's Rich Skull, dude. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=226.6s)]
*  Then that's what we should have done. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=227.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=228.6s)]
*  Because we took her... [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=229.6s)]
*  Yeah, we just wanted one flag. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=230.6s)]
*  It was like the flag of surrender and she did... [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=231.6s)]
*  And, you know, and we didn't see it. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=234.6s)]
*  So it was just a long day, man. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=237.6s)]
*  You had a better day than me. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=240.6s)]
*  You played Nissan Stadium yesterday. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=241.6s)]
*  I did, yeah, last night. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=243.6s)]
*  That was crazy, man. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=244.6s)]
*  Yeah, it was good, dude. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=245.6s)]
*  It was... [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=246.6s)]
*  My mom was there, so I think that's kind of cool, you know? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=247.6s)]
*  She probably didn't... [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=251.6s)]
*  She probably didn't... [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=255.6s)]
*  I probably didn't look like the most promising prospect 10 years ago to play country music [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=256.6s)]
*  successfully, so I think that probably helps her sleep a little bit at night to see it [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=261.6s)]
*  going well like that. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=265.6s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=266.6s)]
*  Do you think that... [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=267.6s)]
*  So 10 years ago, you think she didn't have probably as much confidence in you? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=268.6s)]
*  No, I mean, I don't think... [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=271.6s)]
*  If you'd look at it from a scout evaluating a ballplayer... [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=273.6s)]
*  Okay, you'd say, all right, here we got this guy. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=277.6s)]
*  You'd have probably been like, he's never going to make it. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=278.6s)]
*  Yeah, and then he makes it to the league, so... [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=281.6s)]
*  Did it feel like that last night coming out there, like that I'm making it to the league? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=284.6s)]
*  I mean, that must have felt like something unique. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=289.6s)]
*  I mean, not many people get to play a stadium, no matter how well they're doing. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=290.6s)]
*  Man, it was cool. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=294.6s)]
*  I was so tired and so hungry that I was really excited to get done with it and go home. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=295.6s)]
*  But it was dope, certainly, a lot of people. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=303.6s)]
*  Was it kind of the thing where, I'm on dang drugs? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=306.6s)]
*  Yeah, but it's kind of shining. It looks good. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=310.6s)]
*  The lights are hitting it. It's bouncing. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=312.6s)]
*  It's good. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=314.6s)]
*  Come get it. Yeah, if there's anybody out there with dry skin... [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=315.6s)]
*  Old Spice commercial coming in. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=318.6s)]
*  Come give me a hug, honey. I will definitely moisten you up. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=320.6s)]
*  Yeah, did it feel like... So you're walking out in front of that many people. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=326.6s)]
*  Can you feel... Does your body start to not... [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=330.6s)]
*  Because I mean, I have feelings. I'll walk out in front of a few thousand. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=332.6s)]
*  And there's moments where, like, I think especially the first time where it's like, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=335.6s)]
*  Okay, are my legs still moving forward? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=338.6s)]
*  Like, it's almost you disconnect a little bit from yourself. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=341.6s)]
*  Man, that's only happened to me one time when we played the Houston Rodeo at the beginning of this year. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=343.6s)]
*  It's like the only time that I was like gummy worm legs out there. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=348.6s)]
*  You know, I'd had like... I tried to have like a couple cocktails, take the edge off. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=352.6s)]
*  71,000 people sold out the Houston Texan Stadium. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=356.6s)]
*  We were headlining and the stage is rotating. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=359.6s)]
*  And I was the whole like 60 minute show. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=363.6s)]
*  I'm out there and I was just like a mess, dude. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=365.6s)]
*  Like I ate shit on stage. I've never fallen on stage. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=368.6s)]
*  Really? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=371.6s)]
*  I fell. It was great. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=372.6s)]
*  Oh, you were just... [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=373.6s)]
*  Yeah, dude. It was the full experience. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=374.6s)]
*  And when you were saying, do you feel like as you were singing that you also like had control over what you were saying? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=377.6s)]
*  Because I'm trying to wonder if... Because physically I can understand. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=382.6s)]
*  Maybe it's like, Oh, man. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=385.6s)]
*  It's just overwhelming. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=386.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=387.6s)]
*  It's like usually if I'm nervous like one or two songs in, you're back to... [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=388.6s)]
*  It's probably the same thing when doing stand up. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=392.6s)]
*  Like, you know, even if you are nervous, like once you get into your jokes, you're rolling, right? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=394.6s)]
*  You've done it a thousand times. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=398.6s)]
*  But that was like the one night that I was like... [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=399.6s)]
*  The whole entire show, I was just like googly eyed up there. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=402.6s)]
*  Like could not gather myself. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=405.6s)]
*  Wow. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=406.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=407.6s)]
*  So last night when I walked out there, I was just... [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=408.6s)]
*  I just, I don't know, you're kind of... It's just normal. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=411.6s)]
*  You've done it. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=413.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=414.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=415.6s)]
*  Dang it. Isn't it kind of interesting how things that would seem like a dream start to feel kind of normal? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=416.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=421.6s)]
*  Well, that like kind of messes with me with crowds, man. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=422.6s)]
*  When we go somewhere, we'll only sell like three or four thousand tickets, which is a lot of people. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=424.6s)]
*  It's a lot. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=427.6s)]
*  It used to be like huge for us. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=428.6s)]
*  And now when we only sell three or four thousand, I'm like, have we peaked? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=430.6s)]
*  Is it over? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=435.6s)]
*  And then the next night we'll sell ten thousand. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=436.6s)]
*  But it's like, it's that perspective thing, man. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=437.6s)]
*  You get... It's crazy what you can get used to. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=439.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=441.6s)]
*  Very quickly. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=442.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=443.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=444.6s)]
*  How quick it happens. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=445.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=446.6s)]
*  That's really what's wild. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=447.6s)]
*  So you started out... [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=448.6s)]
*  I'm from Texas, man. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=449.6s)]
*  And tell me a little bit about like, do you remember like the first like song or anything you ever heard? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=450.6s)]
*  Do you remember anything like that? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=454.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=455.6s)]
*  The first like song I ever fell in love with was Amarillo by Mourning by George Strait. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=456.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=461.6s)]
*  Which was a good one. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=462.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=463.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=464.6s)]
*  I didn't even know what Amarillo was, man. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=465.6s)]
*  And I remember... [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=466.6s)]
*  I just played there on Saturday night. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=467.6s)]
*  Wow. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=468.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=469.6s)]
*  I called it their national anthem on stage and I got a real good reaction. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=470.6s)]
*  They liked that a lot. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=473.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=476.6s)]
*  I remember hearing... [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=477.6s)]
*  I'm trying to think of the first... [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=478.6s)]
*  Oh, I heard Bon Jovi was the first song that I ever heard. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=481.6s)]
*  They were going to be a big deal. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=484.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=486.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=487.6s)]
*  The first time I remember hearing a song, Bon Jovi and I was with like a babysitter. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=488.6s)]
*  I've told the story before, but I was with a babysitter. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=491.6s)]
*  And so I think like there was also like a woman there. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=493.6s)]
*  My mom wasn't there. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=495.6s)]
*  Was she hot? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=496.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=497.6s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=499.6s)]
*  I feel like all babysitters are hot when you're the baby they're sitting. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=500.6s)]
*  Dude, yeah. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=502.6s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=505.6s)]

*  Does it feel different being married? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=602.6s)]
*  Does it feel... [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=604.6s)]
*  No, I've been home like three nights since we got married. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=605.6s)]
*  I went on the road. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=609.6s)]
*  So it's no different at all. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=610.6s)]
*  Dang. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=614.6s)]
*  Other than now when I come off stage, I just get on my bus and go to bed. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=615.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=619.6s)]
*  So that's about the only thing that's changed. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=620.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=621.6s)]
*  So take me out of then. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=622.6s)]
*  So take me where you start music. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=623.6s)]
*  You start... [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=624.6s)]
*  The first song you hear or that you remember hearing is George Strait, Amarillo by Morning. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=625.6s)]
*  That's the first song you remember hearing? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=628.6s)]
*  Yeah, the first one I can remember being like, I like that. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=630.6s)]
*  That sounds good. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=633.6s)]
*  I want to do that. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=634.6s)]
*  And I was probably like, I don't know, seven, maybe six years old, something like that. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=637.6s)]
*  But my older brother, Tyler, he's like phenomenal songwriter. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=642.6s)]
*  He was the one that when I was a kid, he's a big brother. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=645.6s)]
*  I just wanted to do whatever... [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=648.6s)]
*  He could have been fucking ice skating. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=649.6s)]
*  I would probably be a professional ice skater right now. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=651.6s)]
*  Whatever big brother was doing is what I wanted to do. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=654.6s)]
*  But he happened to play guitar and want to write songs. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=656.6s)]
*  And I was like, all right, I'm going to do that. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=658.6s)]
*  So do you have no doubt that that's kind of where your passion for it came from? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=662.6s)]
*  Yeah, no question. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=666.6s)]
*  I remember being like a little kid and I would hear that song or any song and I would sing it all the time. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=668.6s)]
*  But I don't think anybody ever thought that I would sing it or be singing 20 years later. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=676.6s)]
*  And at what point did it start to turn into kind of a job for you? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=682.6s)]
*  Or even like how did it evolve then into a hobby? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=686.6s)]
*  Did somebody get you an instrument? [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=689.6s)]
*  Were you like dialed in at school in music? [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=691.6s)]
*  No, I was like... [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=693.6s)]
*  You're sweating so bad. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=694.6s)]
*  Dude, I think it's good for a run. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=695.6s)]
*  I just went for a run. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=697.6s)]
*  The lights look so good on the sweat, dude. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=699.6s)]
*  I would just own it. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=702.6s)]
*  I'm owning it, but I just feel like... [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=703.6s)]
*  I think it's sharp, dude. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=705.6s)]
*  I think it's kind of setting the vibe, setting the tone. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=706.6s)]
*  There's no question with the time of year that we did this interview. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=709.6s)]
*  There's no doubt about that. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=713.6s)]
*  It's fucking summertime. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=715.6s)]
*  The good thing is summer's almost over though, so not a whole lot of heat left. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=717.6s)]
*  Only about four months. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=720.6s)]
*  Well, at least two months of her sitting right over here on my forehead. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=721.6s)]
*  That's for sure, baby. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=724.6s)]
*  Dang, I feel lit up, man. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=725.6s)]
*  It is wet, dude. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=726.6s)]
*  I feel like the Lord is just, God, washing me with his tongue. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=727.6s)]
*  So lit... [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=733.6s)]
*  Dude, I am so sleeky. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=734.6s)]
*  I can't even like... [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=736.6s)]
*  I feel like getting my thoughts together, dog. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=737.6s)]
*  Dude, that's good, man. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=739.6s)]
*  That's what I feel like, dude. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=742.6s)]
*  You make me feel better. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=743.6s)]
*  I was debating hitting the pin before I came. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=744.6s)]
*  Were you really? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=746.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=747.6s)]
*  Damn. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=748.6s)]
*  But it's kind of hit or miss. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=749.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=750.6s)]
*  Because sometimes you hit the pin and you're real funny and you're witty [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=751.6s)]
*  and it goes well. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=753.6s)]
*  And the other times you hit the pin and you're like, I mean, just worthless as could ever be. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=754.6s)]
*  So I was like, man, I think I'll just... [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=760.6s)]
*  No pin this morning. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=762.6s)]
*  Yeah, that's probably a good... [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=764.6s)]
*  I mean, yeah, I think that's that risk because you can't tell exactly how much you're going to get. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=765.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=770.6s)]
*  You know? [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=771.6s)]
*  And this is my driver, shout out Flex, always gives me these pins. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=772.6s)]
*  He always sneaks them. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=775.6s)]
*  When I'm getting out, I'll get my $100 bill and he hands me these little... [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=776.6s)]
*  The pins nowadays look like they come from Target. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=779.6s)]
*  Anything. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=782.6s)]
*  And the candy section. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=783.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=784.6s)]
*  And he'll hand me one and sometimes they're... [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=785.6s)]
*  I mean, it's like, you know, doing crack or something. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=787.6s)]
*  I mean, you hit it and you're like, I don't... [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=790.6s)]
*  What is weed nowadays, man? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=792.6s)]
*  Back when I was in high school, like it was dirty and had seeds and stems, you know? [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=793.6s)]
*  And nowadays it's like, like you may end up literally like dead. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=797.6s)]
*  It's so powerful. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=802.6s)]
*  Oh, I feel, yeah, some of the stuff, man, I remember hitting something one time [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=803.6s)]
*  and I felt like they were just like somebody had done construction in my head. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=806.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=810.6s)]
*  Does it make you think a lot? [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=811.6s)]
*  Well, that's a good word to make me think. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=816.6s)]
*  I didn't want to hit it because I would come in here [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=818.6s)]
*  and I would look you dead in the eye and you'll be talking. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=820.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=823.6s)]
*  And then you get done talking and I'll have to go, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=824.6s)]
*  Theo, what did you just say? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=826.6s)]
*  Because I'm out there thinking about the fact that we're on a rock [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=827.6s)]
*  floating around a ball of fire in the void, you know, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=830.6s)]
*  instead of having the conversation that I'm a part of. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=832.6s)]
*  And so I was like, we'll hit it after. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=835.6s)]
*  We'll hit it on the way home. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=838.6s)]
*  On the way home. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=839.6s)]
*  I felt like it gives my mind a vacation sometimes. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=840.6s)]
*  When I used to smoke weed, it would give my mind a vacation, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=842.6s)]
*  but sometimes I would get too paranoid. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=844.6s)]
*  And then one of the first times I ever got high was at this girl's house [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=846.6s)]
*  and everybody had left. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=850.6s)]
*  We all smoked weed and everybody else left the room. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=852.6s)]
*  And then I remember her dad, I kind of like, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=855.6s)]
*  her dad had been like sitting there watching me be stoned. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=861.6s)]
*  Like I was just like laying on the couch being stoned and it scared me so bad. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=864.6s)]
*  I thought I had been in this room for like 15 minutes by myself. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=867.6s)]
*  I was like talking out loud and kind of like saying positive things to myself [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=869.6s)]
*  and shit and then I look over. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=874.6s)]
*  And her dad, who was one of our teachers at our school, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=876.6s)]
*  was fucking standing there, dude. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=880.6s)]
*  Oh no. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=883.6s)]
*  And man, I think at that point it made me feel so like kind of introverted [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=884.6s)]
*  about when I was stoned, you know? [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=889.6s)]
*  And then I used to get, when I was young, me and my buddy would, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=892.6s)]
*  we ate a bunch of no-dos one time. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=897.6s)]
*  We were supposed to go pick these girls up. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=899.6s)]
*  No-dos? [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=901.6s)]
*  Yeah, it was like caffeine pills, you know? [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=902.6s)]
*  And this is before we could get any weed, you know? [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=904.6s)]
*  We're just like, what can we do at the convenience store? [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=907.6s)]
*  To make us feel different than we do right now. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=910.6s)]
*  Yeah, 100% baby. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=912.6s)]
*  So yeah, I took, we took a pack, man, and we took, we split a pack or something. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=914.6s)]
*  We were supposed to pick these girls up for this date and we parked like by the street [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=922.6s)]
*  and we were so hot, we just, I don't know, we could feel our hair growing and shit [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=926.6s)]
*  and we literally, we couldn't move and get out of the vehicle. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=932.6s)]
*  So we just looked over at these, we could see them on the porch waiting for us and shit [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=936.6s)]
*  and we just sat, we just sat in that car for a long time. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=940.6s)]
*  It's a hit or miss thing, man. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=946.6s)]
*  Sometimes I hit it and I'm like, you know, I've written some of my biggest songs. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=949.6s)]
*  Oh really? [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=953.6s)]
*  Yeah, some of the biggest songs I've ever written are right after. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=954.6s)]
*  Coming off of a bus, yeah. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=958.6s)]
*  You know, it just makes me think weird and then, but it's so funny, like, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=960.6s)]
*  I hit that pin all the time, way too much, and every single time I take a rip of it for 20 minutes, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=964.6s)]
*  I'm like, I need to get my life together, I'm a failure, this isn't going well. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=971.6s)]
*  And then after 20 minutes, I'm like, damn, I want to hit that pin again, that was great, you know? [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=975.6s)]
*  But it's the paranoid thing you're talking about, it's like every time. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=979.6s)]
*  Well, that's interesting though, because then why would our brains be like, hey, I want to hit it again. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=983.6s)]
*  Yeah, well it's because after the paranoid goes away, you're like, oh, this is great now. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=987.6s)]
*  Remember, it's like Wolf of Wall Street when they take the Quaaludes, you know, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=992.6s)]
*  and like you have to get through the phase of like, where they're moving like snails, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=996.6s)]
*  like, you have to fuck your foot. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1000.6s)]
*  You know that? It's like once they get past that, it's like pure euphoria. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1002.6s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good point, man. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1006.6s)]
*  It's like a lesser example of that. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1008.6s)]
*  I'm trying to think, I remember like, yeah, if I smoked weed, like I remember if I was with a chick, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1012.6s)]
*  I felt like it made your girlfriend feel like a new girlfriend. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1018.6s)]
*  Sure. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1022.6s)]
*  That was one thing that was great about it. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1023.6s)]
*  Dude, if your girlfriend doesn't, it seems like the same old girlfriend, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1025.6s)]
*  and you hit a little bit of weed, bro, surprise you. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1029.6s)]
*  I remember one point sitting there having to guess my girlfriend's name, bro, because I didn't know, you know? [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1033.6s)]
*  That's a lot of options too. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1039.6s)]
*  It's hard to get it right. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1041.6s)]
*  And you can't ask her, I was looking around the house for clues and shit, reading old valentines. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1043.6s)]
*  Well, you gotta take them to Starbucks, right? [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1049.6s)]
*  And let them order a coffee and then they put their name on the cup and that's the old trick. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1051.6s)]
*  That's a great idea. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1056.6s)]
*  If you wake up, you don't know who she is, you just take them to Starbucks. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1057.6s)]
*  Praise God, baby, that fucking Vintay for Vanessa. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1059.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1063.6s)]
*  Is that what it is? [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1064.6s)]
*  That's it, dude. That's classic, man. I never tried that. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1065.6s)]
*  That's a great trick, man. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1068.6s)]
*  We had a question come up with, well, I'm just, today's just been a fucking day, bro. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1070.6s)]
*  I'm glad to be a small part of it. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1076.6s)]
*  Yeah, dude, thanks for coming, man. I appreciate it. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1078.6s)]
*  I'm sorry you catch me on such a weird time. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1081.6s)]
*  I was like, should I even cancel? [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1083.6s)]
*  I didn't want to cancel because I'm happy that you're here, you know? [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1086.6s)]
*  Dude, I'm like the king of canceling, so had you canceled, I would have been like, hell yeah, let's do it another day. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1088.6s)]
*  I love canceling plans. I don't think there's anything, there's no better relief. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1094.6s)]
*  There's no better relief. It's just like when you have something, you know, like last night, had you had a dinner you had to go through after everything that you went through yesterday, if you had to go to, you would have been, the point comes like an hour before. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1098.6s)]
*  We're like, dude, I don't want to go. I just want to stay home. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1110.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1114.6s)]
*  And like the greatest relief in the world is when you make up your mind that you don't give a shit and you're canceling. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1115.6s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1121.6s)]
*  Like after that, then you're just like, oh, we're not going. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1122.6s)]
*  You know, but it's like when you're stressing about having to go and you decide to cancel, it's like it's better than any drug in the world, dude. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1125.6s)]
*  And that is interesting. That is a real high canceling. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1132.6s)]
*  No question. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1135.6s)]
*  Because I have a good excuse. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1136.6s)]
*  Especially if you do. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1138.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1139.6s)]
*  I had a great one. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1140.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1141.6s)]
*  I was like, dude, I've been in a, yeah, I've been. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1142.6s)]
*  In an intervention, I would say that, yeah, that's a gravy one. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1145.6s)]
*  Usually I'm like, hey, I'm tired. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1148.6s)]
*  And you just sound like a pussy. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1150.6s)]
*  It's not. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1152.6s)]
*  I don't ever have a. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1153.6s)]
*  My soul was tired. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1154.6s)]
*  We're in there like pleading, you know, and it was like three hours and it was, it was good. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1155.6s)]
*  But it just, and then when you come up with an L and an intervention, you're like, damn, you want to get the squad together. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1161.6s)]
*  How do we regroup? Who do we send in next time? Should we have done matching outfits? [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1165.6s)]
*  Like, how do we get this right? [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1170.6s)]
*  You know, do we need a baritone? [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1172.6s)]
*  Like, what do we need to pull off the solid intervention? [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1174.6s)]
*  And then had you had a dinner last night and you'd been able to cancel or cancel this podcast today, you'd been like, fuck. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1178.6s)]
*  Yeah, I'm chilling. I got the whole day to just screw off now, which are the others. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1183.6s)]
*  Those are the best days. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1188.6s)]
*  That's my weed pan, dude. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1189.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1190.6s)]
*  Right there. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1191.6s)]
*  Canceling. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1192.6s)]
*  Canceling. Yeah, it's a, it's a hidden gem among people who are very busy. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1193.6s)]
*  Bro, that's a great, you should do it. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1195.6s)]
*  Like sometimes one of your buddies is flipping out about something you have to do. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1197.6s)]
*  Take his phone and be like, Hey, I'm not coming. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1200.6s)]
*  We're not fucking going. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1202.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1203.6s)]
*  Dude, I look forward to it all the time. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1204.6s)]
*  And, you know, like it's, it's a blessing and a curse, right? [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1207.6s)]
*  It's good to be busy. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1209.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1210.6s)]
*  It means you got some shit going on. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1211.6s)]
*  So people are expecting you to be somewhere. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1212.6s)]
*  It's a good thing. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1213.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1214.6s)]
*  But sometimes I'm just like, fuck, dude, I'm not going. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1215.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1218.6s)]
*  I don't even have an excuse. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1219.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1221.6s)]
*  I'm just not fucking going. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1222.6s)]
*  Dang, I can't make it. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1223.6s)]
*  Sorry about it. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1225.6s)]
*  Oh, that's beautiful. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1226.6s)]
*  Sorry about it. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1227.6s)]
*  It's my dad's birthday. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1228.6s)]
*  Yeah, it's my dad's birthday. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1229.6s)]
*  I want to make that a license plate on a car. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1232.6s)]
*  I'm like a cool Corvette. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1234.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1235.6s)]
*  Make it my dad's birthday. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1236.6s)]
*  So just so you always back. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1237.6s)]
*  What's what does that mean? [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1239.6s)]
*  No, it's my dad's birthday. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1240.6s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1241.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1242.6s)]
*  It's a greatest excuse. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1243.6s)]
*  Dude, that is a great excuse, man. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1244.6s)]
*  Wow. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1247.6s)]
*  Thanks, bro. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1248.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1249.6s)]
*  Now I feel much more relaxed, honestly. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1250.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1251.6s)]
*  Because I ended up planes got delayed and I'm like, how do I thought about just driving [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1252.6s)]
*  or just getting a driver to run? [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1255.6s)]
*  Just like, what are we even doing? [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1256.6s)]
*  And I was in Baton Rouge. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1258.6s)]
*  It was just like, you know, just like it was just a lot. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1259.6s)]
*  And it was just like family people have been crying. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1262.6s)]
*  It was just like, Jesus, you know, somebody I thought that was going to get high because [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1265.6s)]
*  of the intervention. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1270.6s)]
*  I'm like, I'm going to need I'm going to need to. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1271.6s)]
*  What is the drug of choice in this intervention? [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1274.6s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1276.6s)]
*  We didn't know what they were on. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1277.6s)]
*  Oh, that makes it super. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1278.6s)]
*  That's a way. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1280.6s)]
*  That's a whole nother ballgame. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1281.6s)]
*  That's like a guessing intervention. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1283.6s)]
*  It was a lot. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1284.6s)]
*  That's like, yeah, it's almost like if the members of the game clue. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1285.6s)]
*  Had to have an intervention like Mr. Plum or something. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1288.6s)]
*  He'd be like, I think she's doing heroin with a needle in the laboratory. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1291.6s)]
*  You know, I think so. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1296.6s)]
*  Yeah, I think she's doing opiates with a curling iron. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1298.6s)]
*  Yeah, in the trap house. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1302.6s)]

*  I'm trying to think of a good one. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1497.6s)]

*  And a lot of them are great. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1502.6s)]
*  Like, you know, from, I don't know if it was the country music awards that gave you like the top new male artist in the year, right? [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1503.6s)]

*  Yeah, it's amazing. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1512.6s)]
*  What I'm trying to get to is how do you get, like, is there then some type of formula? [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1513.6s)]
*  And what pressure comes with how to fulfill that? [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1519.6s)]
*  Because really it's kind of like saying, hey, bro, here's a bunch of pressure. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1523.6s)]
*  Yeah, no, man, no. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1527.6s)]
*  Is that what it feels like? [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1528.6s)]
*  Maybe that's my interpretation. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1529.6s)]
*  Not at all, dude. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1531.6s)]
*  The awards are cool. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1532.6s)]
*  You know, like I watched the award shows as a kid. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1533.6s)]
*  So it's cool to be on them. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1535.6s)]
*  You know, it's just kind of like the stadium thing last night. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1538.6s)]
*  You know, you're like, damn, I used to sit out there. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1540.6s)]
*  Now it's kind of the same concept, which is really cool. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1543.6s)]
*  But man, and I don't know if it's a blessing or a curse, but I just don't give a shit. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1546.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1553.6s)]
*  You know, I really don't. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1554.6s)]
*  I just want to be as successful doing this with as much integrity and respect as I possibly can. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1556.6s)]
*  Trying to do it the hard way, you know, like started from the very, very, very bottom in my pickup truck. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1563.6s)]
*  Got a van, got a trailer, got a nicer van, got a tour bus, then signed a record deal. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1568.6s)]
*  Now we have like three tour buses, 18 wheeler, the whole deal. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1573.6s)]
*  Did it the long hard way, how I wanted to do it. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1576.6s)]
*  And so the awards are great, man. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1579.6s)]
*  The number one song's great. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1581.6s)]
*  Double platinum song, awesome. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1583.6s)]
*  But it just doesn't, like that's not what makes me feel successful. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1585.6s)]
*  You know, it's, they're like just little bonuses, I guess. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1592.6s)]
*  But there's no really pressure. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1597.6s)]
*  I mean, you know, whether you win that award or you don't, you still got to put out another record. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1599.6s)]
*  And you still got to go on the road next weekend. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1603.6s)]
*  You know, so it's, they're great. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1606.6s)]
*  But I don't know, if you're not doing it, if you're not relevant in like 20, I mean you look like George Strait, dude. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1608.6s)]
*  He's like, he just turned 70 and he's still selling out like U.S. Bank Stadium. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1613.6s)]
*  You know, I'm 29. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1618.6s)]
*  I just played at Send Amphitheater in Nashville. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1620.6s)]
*  I had a long fucking way to go, dude. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1622.6s)]
*  So the awards are good, but very, hopefully the very, very beginning of the road. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1624.6s)]
*  And what gets you to that next, like, is there a thing, is it more, you know, because I wonder, [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1629.6s)]
*  I don't know if it translates to the comedy, but it's just like, is there, I guess, is it a certain type of song that kind of, [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1636.6s)]
*  like, what do you feel like you have to have then to continue to keep a trajectory then or even a continuation of where you're at? [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1643.6s)]
*  Man, I think it's the songs. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1653.6s)]
*  And that's what I tell all, like, you know, it's weird now that there's like young guys asking me stuff because I was always the young guy asking the stuff. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1655.6s)]
*  And now I got these younger kids asking me for advice and stuff. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1661.6s)]
*  And I'm like, dude, if you don't have the songs, you're fucked. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1665.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1669.6s)]
*  Like, you may have a big single on country radio. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1670.6s)]
*  I mean, if you have songs, you can sell tickets. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1673.6s)]
*  And that's how you tour and have a career, right? [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1676.6s)]
*  So that's like the biggest thing, man. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1679.6s)]
*  You got to have, you got to write and have the best songs. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1681.6s)]
*  Like Garth Brooks. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1685.6s)]
*  I mean, mega hits. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1687.6s)]
*  George Strait, mega hits. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1688.6s)]
*  Tim McGraw, any genre. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1690.6s)]
*  And that, you know, country music really probably has the most longevity of any genre, it seems like. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1692.6s)]
*  You know, like rap and pop music. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1697.6s)]
*  Like, you don't see a lot of 50 year olds still killing the game and pop and rap. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1698.6s)]
*  But there's people get murdered all the time. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1702.6s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of a lot of dying. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1704.6s)]
*  You know, it's like, yeah, it's not like every couple of weeks, you know, a young Tim McGraw gets gunned down somewhere. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1706.6s)]
*  You know, dude, he probably you've seen him. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1713.6s)]
*  You've seen him lately. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1715.6s)]
*  I just saw him in that show. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1717.6s)]
*  1832. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1718.6s)]
*  The bullet would probably bounce off. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1719.6s)]
*  He's jacked, huh? [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1721.6s)]
*  Dude, he's nasty ripped. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=1722.6s)]

*  And he had like ordered the bark from like the Amazon [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2266.98s)]
*  rainforest or whatever that, [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2270.98s)]
*  whatever chemical that they get for the DMT. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2272.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2274.2599999999998s)]
*  And the bark came in. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2275.1s)]
*  He made it like in his, and now looking back, I'm like, [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2278.02s)]
*  that like our thought, my thought process that day [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2281.82s)]
*  probably should have taken a little longer. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2284.2200000000003s)]
*  But I buddy of mine was in town and he was like, [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2287.6600000000003s)]
*  hey, let's go over to this house. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2289.2200000000003s)]
*  And then this, he's like, he's incredibly smart. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2290.6200000000003s)]
*  This kid that we went to high school with [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2293.9s)]
*  and he's a chemistry major and he made the shit [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2295.06s)]
*  in his dorm room. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2296.7000000000003s)]
*  And everybody took a little hit. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2298.78s)]
*  And I crawled out on the fire escape. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2300.1000000000004s)]
*  It was like a Monday morning at 8 a.m. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2301.86s)]
*  And I like saw myself as a kid. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2303.78s)]
*  Like I saw little like five year old me running across [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2308.62s)]
*  our front yard in the house I grew up in. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2311.5s)]
*  And then all of a sudden it was back. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2314.5s)]
*  And I felt amazing afterwards. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2315.46s)]
*  It was like just complete. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2317.14s)]
*  Did you feel that way afterwards? [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2318.34s)]
*  I felt a little spooked out. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2319.94s)]
*  For y'all that don't know what DMT is, [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2321.2599999999998s)]
*  it's the chemical in your brain that makes you dream. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2322.46s)]
*  Like we talked about smoking crack. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2324.8199999999997s)]
*  DMT is not crack. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2326.22s)]
*  Yeah, no. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2327.58s)]
*  Just for the listeners. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2328.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2329.2599999999998s)]
*  It's like the opposite of it. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2330.1s)]
*  Yeah, it's like can't harm you. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2330.94s)]
*  I would recommend everybody one time in their life does that. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2332.58s)]
*  Because it's like, it's very, I think it's a good thing. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2335.58s)]
*  Yeah, it gave me a different- [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2339.9s)]
*  It's not like a hardcore drug. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2340.74s)]
*  No, right. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2341.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2342.82s)]
*  Yeah, you're probably not gonna see somebody like, [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2343.66s)]
*  you're not gonna get it in like a back alley or something. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2344.94s)]
*  You know, there's not gonna be a shooting over DMT. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2347.1s)]
*  But it's a crazy, it was wild, dude. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2350.02s)]
*  And then like a few minutes and you're out of it. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2351.98s)]
*  And I was, and it felt totally, no one felt great, dude. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2353.94s)]
*  Just like on cloud nine. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2356.34s)]
*  Damn. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2358.22s)]
*  Yeah, I think, I don't remember, [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2359.3s)]
*  I did it then later, because then I got it. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2360.7s)]
*  I was like, I wanna do it again. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2362.5s)]
*  Because I thought I could get to the next level. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2364.58s)]
*  It was like a video game or something. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2366.2999999999997s)]
*  I'm like, oh, I wanna beat that level. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2367.7799999999997s)]
*  See, I've been different, like all that kind of stuff, [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2369.7s)]
*  like any kind of psychedelics or anything, [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2371.5s)]
*  I just like one or two times and I'm out. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2373.18s)]
*  I think that's what those should be. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2376.2999999999997s)]
*  Like people who like, I had buddies [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2379.22s)]
*  that would eat mushrooms like all the time. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2380.7799999999997s)]
*  And I'm like, I don't think those are for that. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2383.98s)]
*  Right. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2387.22s)]
*  You know, like Welch's grapefruit snacks, [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2388.06s)]
*  10, 15 packs, no problem. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2391.2999999999997s)]
*  But mushrooms, probably don't wanna buy the box of those. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2393.9s)]
*  Just a one time, two time deal. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2399.02s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2401.62s)]
*  That's interesting, man. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2402.86s)]
*  Yeah, I think everything's kinda like that. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2404.02s)]
*  But yeah, I remember that DMT man. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2406.3s)]
*  And then we went outside and did it, [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2408.02s)]
*  and it was like in a park, [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2409.6600000000003s)]
*  and then people were recognizing when we were leaving, [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2410.7000000000003s)]
*  and I felt like I could see kinda skeletons a little. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2412.5s)]
*  And that wasn't good. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2415.3s)]
*  So I don't think I wanna do that again. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2416.26s)]
*  No, skeletons, dude, you want it to be happy. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2418.5s)]
*  You want it to be positive. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2420.7000000000003s)]
*  I wanna stay on the joyous side of things. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2422.26s)]
*  Yes. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2423.82s)]
*  We had a question that came in about partying [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2424.78s)]
*  and stuff on the tour, can we get to that? [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2426.1400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I'm sorry, it's so out of near Jesus. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2430.7400000000002s)]
*  I don't know what happened. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2432.46s)]
*  At least we can call Guinness Book of World Records [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2433.3s)]
*  and say we just did the hottest podcast of all time. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2436.3s)]
*  It's gotta be a good group. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2441.6600000000003s)]
*  We should go do one in the Sahara Desert [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2442.5s)]
*  and really set the record. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2444.2200000000003s)]
*  Get Rufus DeSalle to play? [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2445.7000000000003s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2447.0600000000004s)]
*  Do it in Albuquerque. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2448.5400000000004s)]

*  because people overlook how good of a singer he is, [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2536.42s)]
*  because his show, it's all about so hardcore rock and roll, [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2541.14s)]
*  such an entertaining show, [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2544.26s)]

*  Man, I hadn't thought about this in a long time. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2592.14s)]
*  We were playing in Waco, Texas, [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2595.98s)]
*  and this place called The Backyard, [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2598.02s)]

*  during Christmas time, him and I, [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2603.2999999999997s)]
*  and even before we had bus tour buses, [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2604.94s)]
*  like first year we did it, we were just in a van together, [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2607.34s)]
*  and we'd do like six nights the week before Christmas, [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2609.9s)]
*  it's acoustic, go play bars, [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2613.82s)]
*  and it's like the level of entertainment [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2616.14s)]
*  was just unbelievably underwhelming, [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2617.54s)]
*  because we were just so messed up every night [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2621.66s)]
*  by the time we got on stage, it was a lot of fun, [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2623.22s)]

*  and before we even went on stage, [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2629.06s)]
*  I mean, we were floored, dude. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2631.5s)]

*  And after the show, he wanted to go to the Titty Bar, [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2636.62s)]
*  and I don't know if you've ever been to the Titty Bar [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2643.2999999999997s)]

*  There's like two dancers, and that's never been my thing. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2648.4199999999996s)]

*  that shit, huh? [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2869.1000000000004s)]
*  How many liters are in a gallon? [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2869.92s)]
*  See, that's the problem, they give you all these charts, [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2872.26s)]
*  approximately 1.2 to 1.5 gallons, okay. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2874.3s)]
*  So that's like, you think about a gallon of water, [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2877.5800000000004s)]
*  that's just one and a half of those? [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2881.26s)]
*  That's crazy to think that's all that's in us, huh? [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2883.22s)]

*  I thought like a little half a baby pool. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2886.7s)]
*  Half of a baby pool of blood. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2889.14s)]
*  I wonder if that's ever been a thing, if that's ever, [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2892.1s)]
*  has there ever been a baby pool full of blood? [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2895.8599999999997s)]
*  I would hope not. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2898.1s)]
*  Oh God, I hope not. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2899.62s)]
*  But yeah, I mean, I don't know if I get, [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2901.2599999999998s)]

*  That's awesome. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2914.46s)]

*  you're just learning about music, [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2919.42s)]

*  are going out and touring together? [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2923.5s)]
*  How do you, just get me through some of that timeline, [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2924.8599999999997s)]
*  just for our listeners. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2927.54s)]
*  I put out my first record, The Limestone Kid, in 2015, [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2928.8599999999997s)]
*  and had a song called Meet You in the Middle [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2935.54s)]
*  that kind of blew up off of it, [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2938.54s)]
*  and I had a Twitter message. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2940.3s)]
*  I had just gotten a Twitter, [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2944.42s)]
*  and it was from this guy named Co Wetzel, [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2945.6600000000003s)]
*  and he was like, hey man, like your stuff, [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2947.26s)]
*  let's haul it, let's write sometime, or whatever. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2949.1800000000003s)]
*  And I messaged back, I was like, yeah, you know, whatever, [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2951.46s)]
*  love to, and this is like 2014, 2015 something. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2953.2200000000003s)]
*  And I actually ended up meeting this guy named Jake Murphoo, [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2957.7400000000002s)]
*  who's one of Co and I's greatest friends, [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2960.5s)]
*  also a future Hall of Famer in the Game of Life, [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2962.94s)]
*  one of my favorite humans on Earth, [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2966.1400000000003s)]
*  and he was buddies with Co, [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2967.6600000000003s)]
*  and he had started to roll in a row with me, [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2969.5s)]
*  he was tour manager for me at the time, [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2971.58s)]
*  and he was like, man, you gotta meet my buddy Co, [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2974.06s)]
*  and I'm like, dude, I think he messaged me one time [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2975.7799999999997s)]
*  on Twitter, I think he's a singer too, right? [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2977.62s)]
*  And he's like, yeah, he's really good. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2979.5s)]
*  So the first time we ever hung out, we went fishing, [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2982.18s)]
*  I think, I wanna say it was on like the Leon River [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2985.5s)]
*  or something in Stephenville, [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2987.5s)]
*  whatever the name of that creek or river was, [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2988.54s)]
*  and it was like us three people in the smallest john boat [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2990.62s)]
*  that has ever been made, and we were fishing, [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2992.8599999999997s)]
*  and the river had flooded, we almost just had a great time, [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2997.06s)]
*  and started hanging out, [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=2999.58s)]
*  and we just kind of ran around with the same people, [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3001.38s)]
*  and I was kind of rolling a little bit at the time, [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3005.34s)]
*  I had a little bit of steam going in Texas, [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3008.78s)]
*  and obviously when I met him, I was like, [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3010.58s)]
*  dude, he's so fucking good, I was like, [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3012.98s)]
*  people gotta know, you know? [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3014.42s)]
*  So I was trying to kind of, you know, [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3015.6600000000003s)]
*  whatever I could do for them, [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3018.52s)]
*  and they didn't need my help whatsoever, [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3019.6600000000003s)]
*  they were raw, there was no question [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3021.62s)]
*  they were gonna be big time. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3024.44s)]
*  But me and him just became really good friends, [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3026.58s)]
*  and we were kind of the only two in our circle [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3028.54s)]
*  when we started to see a little bit of success [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3032.54s)]
*  that kind of understood kind of the things [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3034.18s)]
*  that were going through our minds, [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3036.74s)]
*  the shit we were dealing with and stuff, [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3037.9s)]
*  and so that's really kind of where [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3038.98s)]
*  I think we became really good friends, [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3041.14s)]
*  was we kind of had each other to be like, [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3042.58s)]
*  yo, talk about your shit, yeah. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3044.18s)]
*  And so, I mean, it was, I don't know, [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3047.2999999999997s)]
*  probably a year or two later, [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3051.18s)]
*  I was sitting at my house in Austin, [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3052.2999999999997s)]
*  working on that next record, and he called me, [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3054.9s)]
*  and he's like, hey man, I wrote this song called Love, [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3056.9s)]
*  would you wanna finish it, write the last verse, [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3059.54s)]
*  and sing it, and I was like, yeah, [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3061.7400000000002s)]
*  do you mind if I kill her? [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3063.26s)]
*  And he's like, no, that'd be great. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3065.1s)]
*  So I wrote the last verse of Love, [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3066.1800000000003s)]
*  like right there, I think I was still on the phone with him, [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3068.1800000000003s)]
*  I was like, what do you think about this? [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3069.98s)]
*  He's like, yeah, it's great, let's cut it, [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3070.8s)]
*  and we went in and cut it, and it was a huge song for him, [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3071.92s)]
*  and did a lot for me too, I got way too much credit [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3074.6600000000003s)]
*  for that song, more than I deserved, certainly. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3076.58s)]
*  That whole, he really deserves all the credit for that, [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3078.6600000000003s)]
*  I just killed her in a little small verse at the end, [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3080.96s)]
*  and man, it was like, the second that song came out, [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3084.12s)]
*  it was like, all right, get ready to be a rock star, [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3087.16s)]
*  cause there was no question in my mind [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3090.16s)]
*  he was gonna be a superstar, so I love him, dude, [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3092.08s)]
*  I'd take a bullet for him any day of the week. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3095.08s)]
*  People love him, I get a lot of requests, [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3097.12s)]
*  a lot of people ask me about him, [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3100.04s)]
*  just spending time with him, [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3101.2799999999997s)]

*  and the way he acts on stage and stuff, [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3119.42s)]
*  and they probably think that's like, [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3120.94s)]
*  he wakes up in the morning and is just like that way, [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3124.46s)]
*  but I mean, he's really just a good dude, man. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3127.62s)]

*  A hundred percent, way more than a baby pool, good old. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3137.46s)]
*  I think he's a six-liter man. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3139.5s)]
*  I think he has an album cover or something, [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3142.1s)]

*  I know it's kind of a general question, [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3751.8s)]
*  but he seems sincere about it. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3753.6s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, dude, it kind of goes back [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3755.0s)]
*  to the trying hard thing, man. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3758.08s)]
*  I mean, you don't have to live here. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3759.6s)]
*  You really don't. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3761.86s)]
*  George Straits, the King of Country Music, [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3762.7000000000003s)]
*  he's never lived in Nashville, never moved here. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3764.16s)]
*  I moved here because I had to get out [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3766.76s)]
*  of what I was just talking about in Austin. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3768.0s)]
*  Like I had to go somewhere, I had to get out. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3769.32s)]
*  And that was my, like the only option for me at the time. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3771.88s)]
*  And I can't wait to move back and buy a ranch [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3775.56s)]
*  and move back to Texas. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3777.8s)]
*  But man, some of the people are here. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3778.7599999999998s)]
*  There's a lot of people trying to do it. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3782.12s)]
*  But if you don't know what you're trying to say, [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3784.72s)]
*  and you don't know who you're trying to be [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3788.2s)]
*  or who you want to be, [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3790.7599999999998s)]
*  then it's gonna take a long time [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3792.4s)]
*  to figure it out in this town. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3794.24s)]
*  I think you have to know, [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3796.36s)]
*  like when I started coming to Randy Rogers [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3797.2s)]
*  when the Randy Rogers band was managing me at the time, [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3799.2s)]
*  he's the one who told me to come here. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3801.16s)]
*  He's like, dude, I think you could be a superstar, [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3802.3199999999997s)]
*  but you gotta go to this town and do it. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3804.12s)]
*  I didn't want to come here. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3805.4399999999996s)]
*  And even when I started coming here, [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3807.64s)]
*  I would call him and I'd be like, [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3808.96s)]
*  dude, I don't want to be here anymore. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3809.96s)]
*  Like I don't want to come back. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3811.96s)]
*  And he's like, you need to, like, just trust me. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3813.52s)]
*  And it was the greatest decision I ever made. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3815.68s)]
*  Shout out Randy Rogers. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3817.96s)]
*  And so to that young man right there, dude, [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3820.2799999999997s)]
*  I would just say, know what you're coming here to do [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3823.24s)]
*  before, you know what I mean? [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3825.8799999999997s)]
*  Like what kind of, what do you really want to be? [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3827.96s)]
*  Do you just want to be a songwriter? [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3830.08s)]
*  Then you need to have some songs [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3831.68s)]
*  that are absolutely as stout as a song can be, [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3833.68s)]
*  as well written as they can be. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3837.6s)]
*  So when you come here, you have a little something [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3838.92s)]
*  to bargain, you know? [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3840.52s)]
*  You have a little something to negotiate with. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3842.48s)]
*  It's kind of like when I signed my record deal, [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3844.4s)]
*  I was already selling a bunch of tickets all over. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3845.68s)]
*  So I had all the, the ball was kind of in my court [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3848.2s)]
*  on the record deal. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3850.68s)]
*  I didn't have to sign one. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3851.52s)]
*  I wanted to sign one. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3852.34s)]
*  So same thing as a songwriter, [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3853.76s)]
*  if you're coming here trying to get a publishing deal, [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3855.0s)]
*  have a little something going already, you know? [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3857.36s)]
*  And be like, hey, I've got these songs. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3860.6000000000004s)]
*  Have a little something and you know, [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3863.0800000000004s)]
*  you don't just want to come in empty handed [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3865.04s)]
*  and you get signed into a bad deal [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3866.44s)]
*  because you don't know any better [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3867.84s)]
*  and you don't have anything to offer. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3868.8s)]
*  That's a great point, man. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3872.2400000000002s)]
*  And I think knowing what you have planned, [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3873.7200000000003s)]
*  I noticed at the Comedy Store in Los Angeles, [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3875.32s)]
*  that's like a popular comedy spot right there. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3877.32s)]
*  And there'll be people that go there, [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3881.7200000000003s)]
*  they make the Mecca out from wherever, you know, [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3883.1200000000003s)]
*  to different cities or wherever town they're from. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3885.8s)]
*  They get the, you know, and I'm going to live here. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3887.8s)]
*  And then some of them choose to just be somebody [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3889.96s)]
*  that sits on the porch and drinks there [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3891.8s)]
*  every other night, you know? [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3893.88s)]
*  It's like, okay, that's fine. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3895.48s)]
*  It's definitely a way to be, you know? [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3897.7200000000003s)]
*  But it's like, are you really living out [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3899.2400000000002s)]
*  what your goal was, you know? [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3902.36s)]
*  Some people, yeah, they just, they'll move to LA [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3904.0800000000004s)]
*  and they'll get invited to all these parties and stuff. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3906.5600000000004s)]
*  But then there's up in the hills doing Coke every night. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3908.1600000000003s)]
*  And it's like, you know, five years go by. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3910.2400000000002s)]
*  And it's like, okay, well, what were some of your goals [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3913.04s)]
*  and aspirations, did you really have any? [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3915.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3916.92s)]
*  That's a, you know, I wish I had set some of those lines [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3917.76s)]
*  in my own life at certain points. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3919.52s)]
*  Same, dude. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3921.04s)]
*  Well, dude, I just realized, like, [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3922.2s)]
*  as organically as you can watch it unfold. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3923.76s)]
*  Like the people around me, I was like, [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3926.36s)]
*  man, nobody's like, nobody, [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3928.72s)]
*  everybody's coming over to my house to party, [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3931.16s)]
*  but nobody's trying to make any money. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3933.08s)]
*  Nobody's trying to build a career. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3934.64s)]
*  Nobody's trying to hustle. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3935.8s)]
*  And it just took me like going to the bottom of that hole [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3937.36s)]
*  to be like, what the fuck, dude? [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3940.68s)]
*  Trying hard and taking care of your business [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3942.88s)]
*  and acting like a grown man, that's cool shit. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3945.32s)]
*  Like that's not for losers. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3949.0s)]
*  It's really fucking cool. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3950.6800000000003s)]
*  And I just, it took me a little longer to realize it [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3951.84s)]
*  than I wish, and dude, do you think about, [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3953.92s)]
*  some people never get there. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3955.92s)]
*  Some people never realize that. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3957.1200000000003s)]
*  Some people realize it when they're 60. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3958.36s)]
*  Some people are born like that, I guess. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3960.08s)]
*  Like my sister, she was born like that. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3961.6000000000004s)]
*  She just hustling out the womb. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3963.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3964.6800000000003s)]
*  Oh yeah, some little babies come out with a watch. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3966.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, dude, they're just destined to hustle [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3967.92s)]
*  and everything's success. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3970.96s)]
*  You'll see a baby soon [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3973.4s)]
*  on a cutthroat umbilical cord, dude. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3974.2400000000002s)]
*  Absolutely, dude. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3975.6s)]
*  Like dang it, mommy. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3976.44s)]
*  I think my sister, probably Michael, [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3978.68s)]
*  was probably one of those people. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3980.16s)]
*  But yeah, I don't know. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3982.4s)]
*  It's, I wish I would have realized that younger. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3983.2400000000002s)]
*  But you're not old. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3986.64s)]
*  No. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3987.84s)]
*  You still got a lot of time. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3988.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3989.52s)]
*  And your music is kind of like, [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3990.36s)]
*  you still make music that almost, [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3992.48s)]
*  it's funny because your music makes me feel, [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3995.16s)]
*  your music makes me feel, [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3998.68s)]
*  I feel young when I listen to your music. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=3999.56s)]
*  That's dope. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4001.36s)]
*  So I don't feel like it has, [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4002.2s)]
*  because it only can have, [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4004.04s)]
*  I feel like music can really only have [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4004.88s)]
*  as much history as you have, [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4006.16s)]
*  if somebody's really to believe it. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4007.8s)]
*  Yeah, you're right, which you know. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4009.4s)]

*  Like a ton. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4032.36s)]
*  It's like basically rap, in a way, pop music. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4033.2000000000003s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4041.88s)]
*  Like, it is, the songs, the production, [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4042.7200000000003s)]
*  his voice is so fucking good, dude. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4045.32s)]
*  But I, like that's just not, [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4048.36s)]

*  I just like writing sad country love songs [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4055.6800000000003s)]
*  about everything going terribly wrong. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4057.76s)]

*  Yeah, dude. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4060.84s)]
*  That's why this whole podcast is about half the time. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4061.6800000000003s)]
*  So yeah. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4063.44s)]
*  Well dude, I just, that's like what I love. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4064.28s)]
*  And I'm like, it's kind of hard to, [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4065.8s)]
*  you know, it's like so much of the genre of country music, [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4069.28s)]
*  especially in Nashville, is so pop influenced. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4073.6800000000003s)]
*  And mine's just, mine's not. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4076.2400000000002s)]
*  And so it's like, I really struggle all the time. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4078.0s)]
*  And I write songs, I'm like, [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4082.2s)]
*  who the fuck is gonna listen to this shit? [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4084.16s)]
*  You know, it's not making you bob your head. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4086.2s)]
*  It's not making you wanna dance or drink beer. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4088.0s)]
*  Like, it's making you wanna go fucking text old gal [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4090.2s)]
*  that you swore you would never talk to again. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4092.8s)]
*  Like that's a big feeling sitting in the chest of a lot of. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4096.2s)]
*  Yeah, dude, that's my favorite songs, dude. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4097.88s)]
*  It's my favorite kind of songs. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4099.92s)]
*  So. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4101.44s)]
*  You know, lamenting, thinking about things, looking back. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4102.28s)]
*  You know. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4104.6s)]
*  And I think what's interesting about it, here's what it is. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4105.44s)]
*  For such a guy, for a guy your age [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4107.6s)]
*  to have some of that perspective, [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4109.5199999999995s)]
*  you don't get a lot of that sometimes. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4111.24s)]
*  So I think that's what I think is really enjoyable about it [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4113.2s)]
*  because it makes me feel kind of young [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4115.719999999999s)]
*  and old at the same time. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4117.16s)]
*  That's dope. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4118.48s)]
*  Because there's some perspective in it, you know. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4120.32s)]
*  It's a lot of looking back. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4122.12s)]
*  It's a lot of like, like you're driving away from something, [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4123.12s)]
*  I feel like a lot of times. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4126.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4128.16s)]
*  You know, like there's something. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4129.0s)]
*  A lot of leaving. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4129.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4130.66s)]
*  A lot of leaving. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4131.5s)]
*  Like this is the record I'm writing right now. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4132.34s)]
*  Like every song's about going somewhere and leaving. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4133.16s)]
*  And I'm like, who the fuck wants to listen to this shit? [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4134.84s)]
*  You know, hopefully a lot of people, but Theo Vaughn. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4137.96s)]

*  was wanting to be in the band. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4196.06s)]
*  And I was like, fuck that, dude. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4197.1s)]
*  No one's doing orchestra. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4198.34s)]
*  I started playing the violin. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4199.18s)]
*  And then- [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4201.62s)]
*  Can you still play that? [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4202.46s)]
*  Fuck, no. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4203.280000000001s)]
*  And then my mom bought me a guitar, [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4204.12s)]
*  just because she had got my brother [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4207.62s)]
*  one of one for Christmas. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4208.820000000001s)]

*  that I didn't get one. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4211.58s)]
*  Right. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4212.42s)]
*  So she bought me one. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4213.26s)]
*  And my brother would never fucking teach me anything. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4214.08s)]
*  Like he would never, like I'd be like, [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4216.46s)]
*  yeah, we teach how to play that. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4217.700000000001s)]
*  And he'd be like, dude, fuck out of my room. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4218.62s)]
*  And so I really just had to like, [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4220.700000000001s)]
*  I'd like learned on like the internet, [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4223.14s)]
*  once the internet very first, [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4225.3s)]
*  like there was a thing called cowboy lyrics. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4226.54s)]
*  And I wrote that on the internet back in the day. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4230.14s)]
*  And you could look up like chords, how to play. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4231.9800000000005s)]
*  And I would learn how to play Chris Knight songs. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4233.820000000001s)]
*  And that's when I was in like seventh grade. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4235.9400000000005s)]
*  And I wrote this song called One Man Mariachi Band. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4238.9400000000005s)]
*  And it was about like going to Mexico and running away [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh9Am5s8v4&t=4242.18s)]
