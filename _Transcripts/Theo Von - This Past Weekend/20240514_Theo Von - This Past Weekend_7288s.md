*  well because they see how you can make that they they probably are buying into this fluidity thing [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=833.08s)]
*  of like they probably as in high school hooked up with girls and were like I know how to hook up [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=839.5600000000001s)]

*  you know because they have to do that like you know especially not maybe kids now but in some [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=849.0s)]
*  states yes but like when I was growing up there weren't out there weren't kids in my [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=853.8s)]
*  graduating class that were gay no one was gay now we're like yeah everybody called everybody gay [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=857.16s)]

*  someone you're just so not into I mean yes I can I've done it before but it's alcohol would [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=871.3199999999999s)]
*  probably make it so I could do it yeah or marriage or yeah I think a lot of people get [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=876.4399999999999s)]

*  and then they're stuck with a gay husband but I think a lot of women because of things like um [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=887.3199999999999s)]
*  watch what happens live they love having a gay it's almost cooler than having a straight husband [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=894.28s)]
*  and whatever he's doing they'd rather have this crazy gay husband and then they just write crazy [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=900.68s)]
*  boy on their butt or whatever before sex whatever I don't know I don't think they ever I think they [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=906.68s)]
*  just I do think they they know he's gay and they just have a tacit agreement that we're gonna do [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=910.68s)]
*  kind of gonna indulge in some of these things but never call it out that you're gay like I feel like [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=915.8s)]
*  it's a good question you're right about like having a being married to a gay man would be [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=920.52s)]
*  fun because there's a feminine energy to him that would be like almost like having a girlfriend [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=924.76s)]
*  it's the largest Pomeranian you can have if you're a woman is a gay husband yeah yes but [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=928.4399999999999s)]

*  reach out to women because it used to be just women only reaching out to men women had to ask [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=1724.44s)]
*  first and i believe women are like you know what we don't want to do that it doesn't it's not sexy [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=1727.8000000000002s)]
*  i would say most men are not really good point bumble really does us a favor by having this [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=1734.0400000000002s)]
*  feature because women need to learn that if you want to attract a man who's a masculine energy [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=1738.6000000000001s)]
*  man you got to let him be the one to lead and men don't really like women taking the lead [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=1743.72s)]
*  feminine energy men do and it doesn't doesn't mean gay men but like there's less there's like 20% [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=1749.0800000000002s)]

*  it's like you're talking to a microphone and like having opinions like that's kind of a turnoff to [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=1788.1999999999998s)]
*  men that's interesting i don't think of you is that way i think probably like eliza maybe i think [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=1792.04s)]

*  you know he was nervous before and he's probably more worried about his own set than thinking [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=2767.4799999999996s)]
*  about the reactions but i think that's a part of being on a roast where you have to like think [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=2771.0s)]
*  about what you're going to do when they make fun of you yeah i can't hide my feelings i think it [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=2775.48s)]

*  fodder and it will hurt a lot a lot so you agree though that there's some pain there oh so much [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=2802.68s)]
*  pain but i did like you like i said i before when i've been doing roast i never thought about [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=2808.68s)]

*  really worried about it and like i'm not saying this joke about jeff ross it's too mean and i [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=2822.2s)]
*  don't even believe it i don't want to say this joke about burke chrysler only having one joke i [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=2826.44s)]
*  don't even feel that way but it's like my friends kept reminding me it's a roast this is what it is [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=2830.04s)]
*  and they signed up for it don't pull back it's just it's this right so i just but i fought it a lot [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=2834.36s)]

*  got miked got sat and then all of a sudden the show starts is that one of the reasons they do [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3124.52s)]
*  what you think so there's no no because then i guess maybe this is a different production company [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3129.24s)]
*  this time different network it used to be comedy central we would all hang out a little bit before [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3133.3999999999996s)]
*  like five minutes before you'd shake their hand like the guy you're about to roast but there was [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3136.8399999999997s)]
*  none of that this time and then afleck i think just wanted in and out because he didn't want [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3140.9199999999996s)]
*  anyone to even know he was there to be roasted and i think he was supposed to stay on stage after he [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3144.52s)]
*  got done but he fucked it he booked it out of there because tom referenced him in his set at [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3149.0s)]
*  some point and it was written in the prompter as if ben would still be there and he was gone so i [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3153.3999999999996s)]
*  think either he got out because it didn't go the way he wanted it to or he got out because he's [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3158.52s)]
*  like i didn't realize it was going to be this kind of thing i'm i'm not going to sit there and get [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3161.88s)]
*  jokes told about me damn so but yeah it was uh that was it was weird so he was just in and out [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3166.04s)]
*  in and out yeah um and yeah what was it like when he was up there what's it like [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3172.44s)]
*  when somebody's up there and they are trying something right and it's maybe not being perceived [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3177.16s)]
*  or going over as well right we all do that it's like trying a new joke it's a brave way to do it [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3181.96s)]
*  it just sucks for him that in the reason his set went poorly um is because he committed to a joke [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3186.6s)]
*  that is the whole like if the joke doesn't work the whole set's gone because the whole set was [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3193.08s)]
*  this one premise of i'm reading a tweet and i'm talking back to this guy so if it the first joke [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3197.24s)]
*  bombs the whole that's what's based he didn't switch to another joke like for me one of my joke [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3202.2799999999997s)]
*  bombs i can get it back in the next one totally different reset but his was all about this one [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3206.92s)]
*  so much risk it was it was it was not a good something either he didn't prepare well enough [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3211.16s)]
*  or something happened but it was but it could have happened to anyone it's just yeah it happened to [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3217.7999999999997s)]
*  him and it sucked he's always been a risk taker though i feel like yeah and he doesn't give a [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3222.12s)]
*  fuck like no one's even talking about whatever that was like it'll be forgotten he'll be fine [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3227.0s)]
*  and he is a risk taker i like that he even did it um and he had a point of view you can tell it like [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3231.16s)]
*  the whole premise of it was like i i hate tom handed me my his phone one day and i saw his [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3237.7200000000003s)]
*  messages and i couldn't even fathom what the hate he was getting so he started talking to that one [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3242.92s)]
*  of those people that was tweeting at him and you could tell he was just really that was his [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3247.0800000000004s)]
*  vendetta he wanted to say something to the fans because he's been attacked so much so yeah it was [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3251.32s)]
*  a good premise like he wanted to get something out that was inside of him it just didn't come out the [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3256.2000000000003s)]
*  right way but it was a good premise i think that was personal for him and obviously to tom of [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3261.0s)]
*  getting so much hate like yeah it's something but it doesn't resonate with other people because we [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3265.08s)]
*  don't most people aren't getting hate online and are just like i don't care like most people are [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3269.64s)]
*  writing the hate exactly like we as comedians are always talking about do you read the hate and [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3274.12s)]
*  stuff people can't relate to that people aren't getting this kind of there are like you know [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3278.6s)]
*  there's a lot of influence that's out there but it's not a relatable thing yeah um i guess if you [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3282.2s)]
*  have like 400 followers and that would be a lot for just a normal person if you know that many [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3287.7999999999997s)]

*  it was different i think because this was live i was just like why are they gonna do that like [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3489.56s)]
*  why do it live because it was an event that's why everyone watched it if this would have been [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3495.0s)]
*  just like something that aired later on i don't think it would have been this good because they [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3499.8s)]
*  were just it was like everyone's like what the fuck this is live it was really crazy and that's why [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3503.48s)]
*  in past roast i've done really i've done this well before in past roast i feel but when after [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3509.7200000000003s)]
*  it's edited everyone looks like they did that good because of the magic of editing so i've never had [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3514.6000000000004s)]
*  like this kind of splash not not that i've been like why didn't more people say i was good it [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3520.6800000000003s)]
*  just i never even thought to think that but i was like i didn't this to me was like a same that i've [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3524.76s)]
*  done on every one but it was just like it wasn't i just did a set that wasn't edited that looked [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3529.7200000000003s)]
*  edited because i knew it wouldn't be edited so i didn't have the benefit of i'll tell that joke [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3534.28s)]
*  and they'll just cut it if it doesn't go well so i just had to make it like perfect thanks man way [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3538.92s)]
*  to think something through sometimes it's so hard to figure out all those little angles and piece [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3543.2400000000002s)]
*  them all together it's really tough it's you know and i got so much advice from my friends who work [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3546.92s)]
*  in production and who work in live production my friends who were just good writers good roast [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3550.76s)]
*  writers like i just got like a lot of advice of like how to frame it and tell a story and [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3556.1200000000003s)]
*  because you could just get up there and just tell the best jokes and like pick the best ones and [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3562.92s)]
*  that would be a great set but there's other elements to it too that make it fun and and can [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3566.5200000000004s)]
*  make it just more palatable i guess yeah i think your level of confidence too having had done it [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3571.1600000000003s)]
*  a lot i think definitely helps also comedy central was horribly late to the social media game [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3575.96s)]
*  can you believe comedy central's still on on one one show they have two shows three original shows [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3581.16s)]
*  right now i think they have south park aquafina and one other animation show that's that's all [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3587.7200000000003s)]
*  their original programming wow like how different is that than even tenure like it's insane but you [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3594.2s)]
*  had comedy you're the one thing that a comedy or title but we've talked about that a lot on here [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3600.04s)]
*  they kind of dropped the wall but the biggest thing that they did was they went late to social [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3603.8s)]
*  media they went really late to it they went late to internet they just were late to that whole game [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3607.32s)]
*  yes um you know they in daily show sorry they have daily show oh sorry they have uh yes that's it [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3613.0800000000004s)]
*  daily show aquafina dig man and south park that's it that's nuts they used to have so much yeah well [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3619.0800000000004s)]
*  times have just changed too i mean people aren't really watching but uh but they were late and i [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3625.96s)]
*  think that didn't help as well so as if roasters did great for people to see it as easily yeah it [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3629.48s)]
*  was like i blew up from the roast because of clips that when tiktok came around right that's when [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3634.92s)]
*  people noticed me from the the original roast and netflix makes good clips i mean their clips just [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3640.52s)]
*  look glossier it's just you know even as compared to stuff you see on cup for some reason they um [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3644.28s)]
*  they just do it they do a better job of it yeah and then tom brady is so high profile you just [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3649.2400000000002s)]
*  don't realize it yeah i didn't even want to do a roast again like i don't know the idea of roasting [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3653.4s)]
*  like the jonas brothers not that they even asked me to do that roast but when that was i was like [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3658.84s)]
*  oh that's the level where they already did that one yeah which was fun and i probably would entertain [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3662.1200000000003s)]
*  it but it was like you it's i just didn't want to put myself up to be made fun of like it's just not [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3666.76s)]
*  worth it to me if it's not a big deal and tom brady i'm like this is a big deal so i i wrote uh i think [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3671.8s)]
*  robbie prah the guy at netflix who books everyone and um i i think i wrote to him and or he wrote to [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=3678.6800000000003s)]

*  the fact like you can say any like i never censored myself but it would get bleeped and bleeped things [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=4396.599999999999s)]
*  aren't as funny as just saying it sometimes they are sometimes a bleep is funnier than the word [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=4400.84s)]
*  right um but it was 100 live like yeah no way so scary so like i'm not kidding you i was oh and [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=4404.84s)]

*  interesting i um i use like the hitachi wand oh my god is that a real like or is like a de walt or [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=5568.4400000000005s)]
*  whatever you can look it up hitachi wand you've seen it before it's like the classic it's like [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=5574.280000000001s)]
*  in porn it's like it's like a back massager looking thing it's like looks like almost a big [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=5579.24s)]
*  white mic all right i think a beaten egg huh that thing is oh it's crazy it's crazy and so i put [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=5583.5599999999995s)]
*  that in the front you know you'll put it in you yeah i guess but that's i i pretty much always [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=5589.16s)]
*  use that and that um because it's uh the vibrations like will make things sometimes swell i guess [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=5594.28s)]
*  so i can get kind of swollen down there if i go too hard but that's what i mean by beat up it's [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=5600.36s)]

*  yeah i've seen something like that i think also uh you should they're amazing everyone should have [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=5609.16s)]
*  one water pick makes that too don't they what's that company called would be too intense but i'm [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=5614.2s)]
*  sure that that would work if i was on the road and didn't have anything and i was really horny i [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=5619.88s)]
*  absolutely probably try a water pick we need more of it in the community girls get out there just i [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=5625.32s)]
*  would really recommend blowing people instead of having sex with them because you can't get pregnant [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=5630.28s)]
*  and like i know sometimes having sex as a woman you go that's that's less scary because women are [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=5634.92s)]
*  scared of being judged after sex like a really when you're young especially like a guy's gonna [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=5642.2s)]
*  think i'm bad at sucking dick and so you avoid it that's what i did and so i would have sex before i [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=5646.28s)]
*  gave a blowjob because i just wanted to do and what do you mean by dick you're talking about [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=5650.92s)]

*  should have because i was just avoiding doing this thing that i thought was high risk but really the [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=5659.72s)]
*  high risk was almost getting pregnant yeah you should have been blowing people definitely definitely [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=5663.16s)]
*  i would i would definitely go back in time i would teach my daughter about blowjobs and say this is [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=5668.2s)]
*  how you do it if you're interested in boys teacher yeah i would if my daughter was starting to be [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=5672.5199999999995s)]

*  there we go boys scouts of america changing name to more inclusive scouting america after years of [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=5771.96s)]
*  woes so are the years of woes about the gender thing or just that they were molesting boys [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=5777.16s)]

*  immediately probably [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havZG455z2U&t=5796.5199999999995s)]
