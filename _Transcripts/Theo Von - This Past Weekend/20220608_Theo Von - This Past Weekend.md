*  You know, uh, and I say this this is why I say that [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3372.6s)]
*  um [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3377.56s)]
*  Because [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3380.44s)]
*  You know, it sounds like you have some realization now you're able to get some perspective maybe [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3383.4s)]
*  That the way you've been operating has investment service in you [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3388.2000000000003s)]
*  Or those you care about the most [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3392.44s)]
*  you know [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3394.76s)]
*  You know, I don't have a wife or child or anything like that. But yeah, it breaks my heart because I know it breaks your heart man [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3396.36s)]
*  You know [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3403.64s)]
*  I know it breaks your heart to see you make the choice [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3405.0s)]
*  To not choose them [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3408.76s)]
*  And that I can relate to [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3413.16s)]
*  You know I can relate to making choices that uh [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3416.28s)]
*  That don't serve you [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3421.2400000000002s)]
*  Or me, you know or you know, I can relate to making a choice that I know isn't good for myself and I do it again and again [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3424.04s)]
*  I can relate to that man. Um, so that's where i'm going to try to relate to you at [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3432.52s)]
*  uh [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3438.28s)]
*  For one, thank you for even thinking to bring this up [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3440.28s)]
*  You know, because i'm sure a lot of people struggle with this kind of stuff [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3443.4s)]
*  And I say that i'm glad you're getting you know, you're i'm glad you're suffering [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3447.0s)]
*  I'm not glad you're suffering, but i'm glad that you're having some some realization because there's some realization there in that suffering. There's some perspective [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3450.6000000000004s)]
*  Um because we need that we need something to adjust the perspective enough so we can see that the operating we're doing isn't doing us well [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3459.7200000000003s)]
*  And if i'm not operating well, then that means that there's something wrong with the operation or the operator that's me [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3467.8799999999997s)]
*  There's something unaligned. It's not wrong. It's just something unaligned because i'm not choosing the best choices that are making me feel good [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3473.96s)]
*  Um [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3484.6s)]
*  And so I got to adjust and for me that's where you know going leaning back into my program 12 steps that kind of stuff helps immensely [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3486.68s)]
*  It does magic behind the scenes that you can't even quantify [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3492.8399999999997s)]
*  Um [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3500.6s)]
*  And it takes away that shame that's what I hear in you too I hear shame [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3503.8799999999997s)]
*  I hear shame man. Damn and shame is what shame is that shame is a trickster [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3509.64s)]
*  Shames play, you know shame plays a dirty trombone dog [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3517.16s)]
*  That's a little soil soldier dog. That's all he's got [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3521.08s)]
*  In that uh in that music maker is sod bro [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3525.16s)]
*  Because he he's a dirty shame is a dirty because you start hearing feeling your own shame and then that keeps you stuck shame is a mud [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3529.16s)]
*  It's a real mud [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3537.0s)]
*  So anyway, man i'm saying a lot of that stuff because uh now you have some perspective so now [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3540.04s)]
*  You can see you got to make some adjustments so that you're making different choices towards the people you're working with [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3545.16s)]
*  Towards the people you care about the most [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3550.3599999999997s)]
*  And it's possible that's what i'm going to tell you here i'll take these off too [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3556.04s)]
*  I don't want to be talking serious with you [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3558.8399999999997s)]
*  Not be able to see you or as best I can [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3561.08s)]
*  You know, it's hard to choose love sometimes in the world it's hard it's hard [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3570.8399999999997s)]
*  And I don't know why you're not doing it in your life. I don't know why [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3577.08s)]
*  I don't know why you're not doing it [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3580.4399999999996s)]
*  But there's a lot of people out there not doing it [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3583.24s)]
*  You know, i've not done it a ton. There's areas of my life. I'm not doing it [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3586.68s)]
*  I'm choosing something else and I don't know why [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3590.9199999999996s)]
*  And you know what I don't exactly have to figure out that why what I what I do have to do is just [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3595.16s)]
*  Get myself into a place where i'm choosing the things I need to do be choosing [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3599.0s)]
*  And so that's where I believe that a 12-step program can help you out [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3602.4399999999996s)]
*  Uh, because that has been the best success that i've had after all the things i've tried [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3605.8799999999997s)]
*  That program I feel like is best [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3611.16s)]
*  Giving me the opportunity and the different feelings inside [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3614.2s)]
*  To have a new experience [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3618.12s)]
*  And it's not over with the gal. That's not over [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3620.8399999999997s)]
*  She can't tell you that everything's going to be okay right now. That's not fair. That'll keep you in the same spiral [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3623.72s)]
*  You know if she throws a life preserver into the toilet you still in the toilet [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3629.64s)]
*  You know i'm saying baby, you know, we got to get you into a damn birdbath, dog [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3635.3199999999997s)]
*  That's where we got to get you [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3640.2s)]

*  I was a drunk [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3659.56s)]
*  i'm [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3661.48s)]
*  finally realizing everything and trying to be better but [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3662.6s)]
*  I [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3666.1200000000003s)]
*  Finally it's too late. So, you know [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3667.32s)]
*  I was wondering if you had any advice on how to keep on going man [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3670.52s)]
*  Love you [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3674.2000000000003s)]
*  And the advice will start to come from a higher power and from the program so that will help you [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3677.4s)]
*  You'll get it. It's it's interesting. It'll start to get built into you [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3682.28s)]
*  You just keep going to meetings and keep listening to people and I would go to speaker meetings [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3685.88s)]
*  You can go to them on zoom first if you feel more comfortable [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3690.2000000000003s)]
*  And [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3696.76s)]
*  Because once you start to feel like you can keep on going then you're going to feel like you can go further [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3698.1200000000003s)]
*  But first you got to feel like you can go [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3703.0s)]
*  And then it will all evolve man, I promise you [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3706.44s)]
*  I promise you [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3710.52s)]
*  You will have other opportunities with this with this person with this child. You'll have all of that [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3712.2000000000003s)]
*  You know [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3719.1600000000003s)]
*  All those things are possible but now if you know that something's wrong and you continue to do you continue to do it [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3720.12s)]
*  Then you are kind of choosing to suffer [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3727.0s)]
*  You know you said real [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3731.24s)]
*  Realized it, you know you realize these things so now you have knowledge [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3733.24s)]
*  So once you have that knowledge if you continue to do it [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3737.24s)]
*  Then you are choosing to suffer [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3740.8399999999997s)]
*  You know, uh [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3743.96s)]
*  And sometimes you may make that choice, but if it's a continued thing, man, it's you know [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3745.56s)]
*  And I just said i'm not judging you i've done it [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3750.2s)]
*  And that's where self-pity starts for me. I continue to stay in these loops and I don't even recognize it [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3753.3199999999997s)]
*  I just continue to want to have a some reason to suffer [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3759.4s)]
*  And I just don't want to see the same thing happen to you man that's that's happened to me before you know, uh, so [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3766.92s)]
*  Anyway, just don't feel alone brother and just keep your head up baby [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3772.6s)]
*  You know, um [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3776.2s)]
*  Because you're not alone man, I mean there's probably 500 000 people listening to this that are thinking of you [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3778.6s)]
*  And that wants you to want you to try [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3786.9199999999996s)]
*  You know, they want you to try [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3790.68s)]
*  You know and I want you to try too I know it's hard man [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3796.12s)]
*  It's hard, bro [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3799.48s)]
*  It's hard to fucking try especially when you have that there's a feeling inside of you like the world never [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3800.68s)]
*  It never tried for you [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3805.16s)]
*  This world never fucking tried for me [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3807.0s)]
*  But that's that's just a feeling man [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3812.6s)]
*  You know [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3816.12s)]
*  And god gave you like a beautiful child or whatever you believe in gave you a beautiful child man [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3817.08s)]
*  And you got a voice you have the ability to care about yourself enough to call [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3821.96s)]
*  You have gifts [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3826.68s)]
*  You have gifts man and um [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3828.44s)]
*  And I believe that you can do it brother [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3833.08s)]
*  I believe you can have a new experience and that's what I want for you because it seems like that's what you want for you [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoeUmn0zC8M&t=3834.68s)]
